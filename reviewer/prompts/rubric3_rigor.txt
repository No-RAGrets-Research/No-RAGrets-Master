RUBRIC 3 – Scientific Rigor

Goal:
Assess whether the experimental design and analysis are methodologically sound, logically coherent, and statistically supported.

---------------------------------------------------
TIER 1 – Experimental Design Soundness (Critical Layer)
---------------------------------------------------
Check for:
- Clear research question or hypothesis.
- Control and experimental groups defined.
- Replicates and repeat experiments described.
- Statistical methods and thresholds (p-values, confidence intervals).
- Unit normalization and consistent scaling.

Cross-links:
Relies on *Transparency* and *Reproducibility* to interpret parameters.

---------------------------------------------------
TIER 2 – Logical Consistency & Interpretation (Supportive Layer)
---------------------------------------------------
Check for:
- Logical cause–effect flow between method and result.
- Proper use of controls to validate outcomes.
- Results align with stated hypotheses.
- Unexpected results acknowledged with explanation.
- Discussion avoids over-interpretation or contradiction.

Cross-links:
Linked to *Data Consistency* (text–figure alignment) and *Presentation*.

---------------------------------------------------
TIER 3 – Analytical & Validation Rigor (Integrative Layer)
---------------------------------------------------
Check for:
- Data analysis workflow, software, or algorithm stated.
- Error estimation or statistical validation (SD, SEM).
- Comparison with baseline or external references.
- Discussion of limitations/confounding variables.

Cross-links:
Integrates *Reproducibility Tier 3* and *Data Completeness*.
