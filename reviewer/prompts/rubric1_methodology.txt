RUBRIC 1 – Methodological Transparency

Goal:
Assess whether each experimental procedure is described with enough quantitative and contextual detail to allow replication by another laboratory.

You are evaluating reporting quality, not scientific correctness.
If information is missing, mark it as “not reported,” not “incorrect.”

---------------------------------------------------
TIER 1 – Quantitative Descriptions (Critical Layer)
---------------------------------------------------
Check for:
- Numeric values with units (mass, volume, concentration).
- Centrifugation: speed (g or rpm) + time (+ temperature if relevant).
- Shaking/incubation: temperature, rpm, duration, and medium type.
- PCR: step temperatures, durations, cycle count, and reaction volume.
- Media and buffer composition (including pH).
- Optical density or growth phase indicator (e.g., OD₆₀₀ = 0.8).
- Supplier and catalog number for reagents.
- Microbial strain or plasmid identifier (ATCC, Addgene).
- Reference to supplementary materials containing detailed protocols.

Cross-links:
Missing Tier 1 details affect both *Reproducibility & Traceability* and *Scientific Rigor*.

---------------------------------------------------
TIER 2 – Procedural & Environmental Context (Supportive Layer)
---------------------------------------------------
Check for:
- Environmental control parameters (O₂, humidity, light, sterility).
- Sample storage/preparation details (temperature, medium, freeze–thaw cycles).
- Instrument model or calibration mention.
- Ethical/safety statements (biosafety level, pathogen control).
- Logical ordering of steps (chronological and coherent).

Cross-links:
Tier 2 supports *Scientific Rigor* (design clarity) and *Presentation & Documentation* (flow).

---------------------------------------------------
TIER 3 – Verification & Reference (Integrative Layer)
---------------------------------------------------
Check for:
- Mentions of internal validation, repeatability, or control experiments.
- References to standard protocols or previous publications.
- Accessibility of supplementary or external datasets.
- Software or analysis version numbers (if relevant).

Cross-links:
Tier 3 contributes to *Data Completeness* and overall *Reproducibility* strength.
