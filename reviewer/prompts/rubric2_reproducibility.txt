RUBRIC 2 – Reproducibility & Traceability

Goal:
Determine whether materials, biological entities, and data can be sourced and replicated independently.

---------------------------------------------------
TIER 1 – Material & Reagent Traceability (Critical Layer)
---------------------------------------------------
Check for:
- Each chemical/reagent lists name, supplier, and catalog/batch number.
- Strains/plasmids/cell lines include collection and identifier (e.g., ATCC 3153).
- Buffers and media traceable to cited or described compositions.
- Commercial kits include name and supplier.
- Instrument model/manufacturer mentioned for key steps.

Cross-links:
Depends on *Transparency Tier 1* data and informs *Data Consistency*.

---------------------------------------------------
TIER 2 – Procedural Reproducibility (Supportive Layer)
---------------------------------------------------
Check for:
- Logical sequence of steps for reproduction.
- Citations of standard or published methods.
- Environmental and setup conditions reported or referenced.
- Distinction between biological and technical replicates.

Cross-links:
Overlaps *Scientific Rigor* (replicate design) and *Transparency Tier 2* (context).

---------------------------------------------------
TIER 3 – Verification & Accessibility (Integrative Layer)
---------------------------------------------------
Check for:
- Raw/processed data availability (supplement, repository).
- Repository IDs or accession numbers (GenBank, Addgene, PDB).
- Code or analysis pipeline DOI/version.
- Internal validation (“performed twice independently”).
- Legal/ethical compliance for material sourcing.

Cross-links:
Supports *Data Completeness & Consistency* and *Presentation*.
