      "orig": "Abstract Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a methanotrophic bacterium containing particulate methane monooxygenase (MMO), which catalyzes the hydroxylation of methane to methanol. The methanol is further oxidized to formaldehyde  by  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH).  We developed a novel compulsory circulation diffusion system for  cell  cultivation.  A  methane/air  mixture  (1:1,  v/v)  was prepared in a tightly sealed gas reservoir and pumped into a nitrate mineral salt culture medium under optimal conditions (5 µM CuSO 4 , pH 7.0, 30°C). Cells were harvested, washed,  and  resuspended  (0.6  mg  dry  cells/mL)  in  a 500 mL  flask  in  100  mL  of  10  mM  phosphate  buffer (pH 7.0)  containing  100  mM  NaCl  and  1  mM  EDTA  as MDH inhibitors,  and  20  mM  sodium  formate.  A  single 12 h batch reaction at 25°C yielded a final concentration of 13.2 mM methanol. The use of a repeated batch mode, in which the accumulated methanol was removed after each of  three  8  h  cycles  over  a  24  h  period,  showed  a  productivity of 2.17 µ mol methanol/h/mg dry cell wt. Finally, a  lab-scale  reaction  performed  using  a  3  L  cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 1 L produced 13.7 mM methanol after 16 h. Our results identify a simple process for  improving  the  productivity  of  biologically  derived methanol and, therefore the utility of methane as an energy source.",
      "text": "Abstract Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a methanotrophic bacterium containing particulate methane monooxygenase (MMO), which catalyzes the hydroxylation of methane to methanol. The methanol is further oxidized to formaldehyde  by  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH).  We developed a novel compulsory circulation diffusion system for  cell  cultivation.  A  methane/air  mixture  (1:1,  v/v)  was prepared in a tightly sealed gas reservoir and pumped into a nitrate mineral salt culture medium under optimal conditions (5 µM CuSO 4 , pH 7.0, 30°C). Cells were harvested, washed,  and  resuspended  (0.6  mg  dry  cells/mL)  in  a 500 mL  flask  in  100  mL  of  10  mM  phosphate  buffer (pH 7.0)  containing  100  mM  NaCl  and  1  mM  EDTA  as MDH inhibitors,  and  20  mM  sodium  formate.  A  single 12 h batch reaction at 25°C yielded a final concentration of 13.2 mM methanol. The use of a repeated batch mode, in which the accumulated methanol was removed after each of  three  8  h  cycles  over  a  24  h  period,  showed  a  productivity of 2.17 µ mol methanol/h/mg dry cell wt. Finally, a  lab-scale  reaction  performed  using  a  3  L  cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 1 L produced 13.7 mM methanol after 16 h. Our results identify a simple process for  improving  the  productivity  of  biologically  derived methanol and, therefore the utility of methane as an energy source."
