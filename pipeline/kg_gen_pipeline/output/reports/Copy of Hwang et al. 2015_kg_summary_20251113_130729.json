Thus, methane  has  attracted  much  attention  as  the  alternative chemical feedstock on the positive aspect, but in addition to  being  a  greenhouse  gas  25-times  more  harmful  than carbon  dioxide  [12]. Methane  is  the  resource  of  power stations at present and can be used as a basic raw material However,  methane  is  difficult  to  transport  from production sites in remote locations to the place where it is to be consumed,  since methane  is  a gas  at  ambient temperatures (boiling point: -164 o C) Conversion of methane to methanol has attracted enormous interest  because  methanol  is  easy  to  handle  and  has  a higher  energy density than methane. Methanol is a starting\n\nRecently, methane has attracted much attention as an alternative carbon feedstock since it is the major component of abundant shale and natural gas. In this work, we produced methanol from  methane  using  whole  cells  of Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  as  the  biocatalyst. M. trichosporium OB3b was cultured on NMS medium with a supply of 7:3 air/methane ratio at  30 o C.  The  optimal  concentrations  of  various  methanol  dehydrogenase  inhibitors  such  as potassium phosphate and EDTA were determined to be 100 and 0.5 mM, respectively, for an efficient production of methanol. A  productivity  of  49.0  mg/l\u00b7h,  titer  of  0.393 g methanol/l, and conversion of 73.8% (mol methanol/mol methane) were obtained under the optimized batch condition. Keywords: Methane,  methanol,  methanol  dehydrogenase, Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b, reducing power precursor for the production of various  value-added chemicals [22]. If methane, the main component of natural gas,  can  be  efficiently  converted  to  liquid  fuels,  world reserves of methane could satisfy the demand for transportation  fuels  in  addition  to  use  in  other  sectors. However,  the  direct  activation  of  strong  C-H  bonds  in methane  and  conversion  to  desired  products  remain  a difficult technological challenge. Thus, there are economic and  technological  demands  for  the  development  of  an efficient  conversion  technology  of  methane  to  methanol. However, the direct conversion of methane to methanol is a technological challenge owing to the strong C-H bonds in methane Various chemical processes to produce methanol from  methane  have  been  successfully  implemented  on  a commercial scale. As an alternative, direct biological methods can be employed to convert methane to methanol. Methane-to-methanol  conversion  using methanotrophic cells as the biocatalysts has been conducted to replace the chemical process In metabolic assimilation of methane in methanotrophs, methane is converted to methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO). In addition, NADH or NADPH is regenerated to supply a reducing power for methane oxidation Methanotrophscatalyzed  production  of  methanol  from  methane  with high  yield  still  remains  a  challenge. In  this  paper,  we determined the optimal conditions and further  improved batch methane-to-methanol conversion in high yield using Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  whole  cells. Cultivationrelevant parameters, including air/methane ratio and copper concentration, were optimized.",

Methane-to-methanol  conversion  using methanotrophic cells as the biocatalysts has been conducted to replace the chemical process In metabolic assimilation of methane in methanotrophs, methane is converted to methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO). Methanol is converted to formaldehyde by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), which is then oxidized to formate and finally to carbon dioxide [15]. Thus, methanol is not a final  product  and  is  readily  converted  to  formaldehyde, which  is used  to synthesize cell  biomass via ribulose monophosphate  (RuMP)  or  the  serine  pathway  [10]. In order to accumulate methanol, suitable inhibitors for MDH such  as  phosphate  [16],  cyclopropanol  [25],  or  a  high concentration of NaCl Methanotrophscatalyzed  production  of  methanol  from  methane  with high  yield  still  remains  a  challenge. In  this  paper,  we determined the optimal conditions and further  improved batch methane-to-methanol conversion in high yield using Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  whole  cells. MDH activity was inhibited by adding various chemical inhibitors with optimal concentrations,  and  the  optimal  amount  of  formate  was supplied to regenerate the reducing power for high methanol conversion.",

Thus, methane  has  attracted  much  attention  as  the  alternative chemical feedstock on the positive aspect, but in addition to  being  a  greenhouse  gas  25-times  more  harmful  than carbon  dioxide  [12]. Methane  is  the  resource  of  power stations at present and can be used as a basic raw material However,  methane  is  difficult  to  transport  from production sites in remote locations to the place where it is to be consumed,  since methane  is  a gas  at  ambient temperatures (boiling point: -164 o C) Conversion of methane to methanol has attracted enormous interest  because  methanol  is  easy  to  handle  and  has  a higher  energy density than methane. Methanol is a starting\n\nRecently, methane has attracted much attention as an alternative carbon feedstock since it is the major component of abundant shale and natural gas. In this work, we produced methanol from  methane  using  whole  cells  of Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  as  the  biocatalyst. M. trichosporium OB3b was cultured on NMS medium with a supply of 7:3 air/methane ratio at  30 o C.  The  optimal  concentrations  of  various  methanol  dehydrogenase  inhibitors  such  as potassium phosphate and EDTA were determined to be 100 and 0.5 mM, respectively, for an efficient production of methanol. A  productivity  of  49.0  mg/l\u00b7h,  titer  of  0.393 g methanol/l, and conversion of 73.8% (mol methanol/mol methane) were obtained under the optimized batch condition.

If methane, the main component of natural gas,  can  be  efficiently  converted  to  liquid  fuels,  world reserves of methane could satisfy the demand for transportation  fuels  in  addition  to  use  in  other  sectors. However,  the  direct  activation  of  strong  C-H  bonds  in methane  and  conversion  to  desired  products  remain  a difficult technological challenge. Thus, there are economic and  technological  demands  for  the  development  of  an efficient  conversion  technology  of  methane  to  methanol. However, the direct conversion of methane to methanol is a technological challenge owing to the strong C-H bonds in methane Various chemical processes to produce methanol from  methane  have  been  successfully  implemented  on  a commercial scale.

Methane and oxygen are key substrates for cell growth, and their supply ratio of air:methane is an important  factor  in  the  cultivation  of  methanotrophs. To find  out  the  optimal  air:methane  ratio, M.  trichosporium OB3b was cultivated at various air:methane ratio ranging from 8:2 to 5:5 in NMS medium. In the presence of 30% (v/v) methane,  a  higher  methane-to-biomass  conversion  and specific  growth  rate  could  be  achieved. When  methane above 30% (v/v) was supplied, the final cell density was not affected. At the optimal condition of air:methane = 7:3, the  final  dry  cell  density  (g  cell/l),  methane-to-biomass conversion  (g  biomass/g  methane),  and  specific  growth rate (h -1 ) were 0.21, 0.47, and 0.044, respectively (Table 1). The  effects  of  copper  concentration  on M. trichosporium OB3b growth and the expression of MMO were examined in the presence of various concentrations of copper (from 0 to  100 \u00b5 M)  in  the  medium. Herein,  we quantitatively evaluated the effects of copper concentration on batch cell growth, methane-to-biomass conversion, and specific growth rate. As shown in Table 2, the highest final batch  cell  growth  of  0.34  g  cell/l,  methane-to-biomass conversion  of  0.46  g  biomass/g  methane,  and  specific growth  rate of 0.059 h -1 were  obtained  in  the  media containing 5 \u00b5 M of CuSO 4 . When M. trichosporium OB3b  was  cultured  in  the  presence  of\n\n100 \u00b5 M copper, there was no detectable cell growth and no change in methane  concentration, indicating that the presence  of  high  copper  concentration  above  100 \u00b5 M  in NMS  media  was  inappropriate  for  the  cultivation  of M. trichosporium OB3b (data not shown).

In contrast, methanol production increased with an increase in potassium phosphate  concentration  up  to  100 mM.  The  maximum amount  of  methanol  was  0.309  g/l. However,  methanol production decreased as potassium phosphate concentration was further increased to more than 100 mM. Methane-tomethanol  conversion was  also affected by  potassium phosphate concentration. A 51.1% conversion was obtained with the addition of 100 mM potassium phosphate. The  inhibitory  effects  of  sodium  formate,  potassium phosphate,  and  EDTA  on  MDH  activity  were  analyzed. There  was  no  inhibitory  effect  of  sodium  formate  on  the MDH activity, but there was 9.3% and 15.2% inhibition of MDH in the presence of 100 mM potassium phosphate and 0.5mM  EDTA,  respectively.",
