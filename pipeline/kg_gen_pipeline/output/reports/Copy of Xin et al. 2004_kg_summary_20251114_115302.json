By alternate reaction and regeneration, the results show that resting cell of M. trichosporium IMV 3011 can be used for many times to catalyze the reduction of carbon dioxide, in which the origin of the reducing equivalent is methane.

Methanol can be produced chemically via methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etcll-s) Synthesis of methanol from carbon dioxide has several obvious advantages. For example, carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases, which have been theorized to contribute to global warming. However, the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol is fundamentally difficult to achieve under mild condition in chemical catalysis. Conventional methods for synthesizing methanol from CO, suffer from certain drawbacks such as inefficiencies, costs, high energy consumption and the need for special equipment adapted for high temperature or highly corrosive environments. Enzymatically coupled sequential reduction of CO, to methanol, using a series of reaction catalyzed by three different dehydrogenases, particularly appealing. Accordingly, a new technique for conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol that alleviates such drawbacks is desired.",
