        "text_evidence": "This  study  has  examined  potential  of  microbial  consortium  enriched  from  rice  field  soil  for bioconversion of  methane to methanol. On industrial scale, methane (natural gas) is used as feedstock for production of  various  hydrocarbon  derivatives  using  Fischer-Tropsch process (Dry, 2002; Holditch, 2003; Jones et al., 2022). One of the derivatives is methanol (15.6 MJ/L) which has higher energy density than methane (36.6 \u00d7 10 GLYPH<0> 3 MJ/L). As  a  liquid  fuel,  it  is  much  easier  to handle, easier to blend with gasoline, fits into current infrastructure and can be used as a feedstock for other chemical processes (Bromberg and Cheng,  2010;  Ge  et  al.,  2014a). Methanol  is  also  produced  using methane by direct methane to methanol (DMTM) technique which is also  a  chemical  process  (Wang  et  al.,  2022b). Biological methane to methanol conversion (bioconversion) is carried out by a set of organisms known as methanotrophs. These methane utilizers capture and metabolize methane as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth and metabolism using metabolic enzymes (Dong et al., 2017; Fei et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2014). More  than  100  g-negative  and  strictly  aerobic  methane-utilizing bacteria  were  isolated  and  classified  by  Whittenbury  et  al.  (1970). The methanotrophs are very specific in substrate requirements and can only grow on C1 hydrocarbons, i.e., methane and methanol (Hanson and Hanson, 1996).",

        "text_evidence": "This  study  has  examined  potential  of  microbial  consortium  enriched  from  rice  field  soil  for bioconversion of  methane to methanol. On industrial scale, methane (natural gas) is used as feedstock for production of  various  hydrocarbon  derivatives  using  Fischer-Tropsch process (Dry, 2002; Holditch, 2003; Jones et al., 2022). One of the derivatives is methanol (15.6 MJ/L) which has higher energy density than methane (36.6 \u00d7 10 GLYPH<0> 3 MJ/L). Methanol  is  also  produced  using methane by direct methane to methanol (DMTM) technique which is also  a  chemical  process  (Wang  et  al.,  2022b). Biological methane to methanol conversion (bioconversion) is carried out by a set of organisms known as methanotrophs. These methane utilizers capture and metabolize methane as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth and metabolism using metabolic enzymes (Dong et al., 2017; Fei et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2014). More  than  100  g-negative  and  strictly  aerobic  methane-utilizing bacteria  were  isolated  and  classified  by  Whittenbury  et  al.  (1970). The methanotrophs are very specific in substrate requirements and can only grow on C1 hydrocarbons, i.e., methane and methanol (Hanson and Hanson, 1996).",

On industrial scale, methane (natural gas) is used as feedstock for production of  various  hydrocarbon  derivatives  using  Fischer-Tropsch process (Dry, 2002; Holditch, 2003; Jones et al., 2022). One of the derivatives is methanol (15.6 MJ/L) which has higher energy density than methane (36.6 \u00d7 10 GLYPH<0> 3 MJ/L). As  a  liquid  fuel,  it  is  much  easier  to handle, easier to blend with gasoline, fits into current infrastructure and can be used as a feedstock for other chemical processes (Bromberg and Cheng,  2010;  Ge  et  al.,  2014a). Methanol  is  also  produced  using methane by direct methane to methanol (DMTM) technique which is also  a  chemical  process  (Wang  et  al.,  2022b). Biological methane to methanol conversion (bioconversion) is carried out by a set of organisms known as methanotrophs. These methane utilizers capture and metabolize methane as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth and metabolism using metabolic enzymes (Dong et al., 2017; Fei et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2014). More  than  100  g-negative  and  strictly  aerobic  methane-utilizing bacteria  were  isolated  and  classified  by  Whittenbury  et  al.  (1970). The methanotrophs are very specific in substrate requirements and can only grow on C1 hydrocarbons, i.e., methane and methanol (Hanson and Hanson, 1996).",

        "text_evidence": "Major  sources  of  methanotrophs  include  agricultural  rice  fields, natural gas fields, dairy and cattle industries, etc. It is interesting to note that majority of methane (90 %) emitted in the wetland rice fields comes from the vascular transport system within the rice plants instead of ebullition or diffusion through the rhizosphere. The rate at which methane is emitted is much less ( < 20 %) than the actual rate of production in the rice fields. The difference in the  rate  of  production  and  emission  can  be  explained  by  methane oxidation by the methanotrophs present in the oxic regions of the rice roots  and  rhizospheres  (Conrad  and  Rothfuss,  1991). Thus,  they  are present in abundance in rice fields and they act as the main methane sink where they capture around 20 % of methane evolved due to decaying of water-logged  organic  matter  (Rahalkar  et  al.,  2021). The  conversion efficiencies  of  transported  methane  by  methanotrophs  remain  in  the range of 70 -95 % in the soil-water interface (Epp and Chanton, 1993; Gilbert  and  Frenzel,  1995). The  rice  field  rhizosphere  community comprises of type I and type II methanotrophs. In fact, no Type I methanotrophs had been isolated from rice rhizosphere, rice roots, bulk soil or floodwater and  only  their  presence  was  confirmed  using  molecular  techniques (Dianou et al., 2012; Pandit et al., 2016; Takeda et al., 2008). Several methanotrophs  with pmoA lineages  from  rice  paddy  cluster  (e.g., RPC1 -3)  have  been  detected  but  remain  uncultured  till  date  (Knief, 2015; L\u00fcke et al., 2014). Methanol production capability of these methanotrophs is yet to be studied. Thus, rice field was chosen for this study since  they  are  a  breaming  source  of  methanotrophs  and  they  are commonly found across India.",

        "text_evidence": "Methanotrophs efficiently convert methane to methanol in a single step using methane monooxygenase enzymes at ambient reaction conditions. The  production  of  methanol  occurs  intracellularly  by  both pMMO  and  sMMO. Extracellular  methanol  accumulation  is  usually achieved by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibition (Patel et al., 2016c). In  this  study,  methanol  production  was  achieved  without addition of MDH inhibitors. The samples from initial culture and fifth day  enriched  cultures  were  taken  and  examined  for  the  presence  of methanol using gas chromatography. The methanol production in the pure strains of M. capsulatus and M. buryatense were also examined after 5 days of incubation (Fig. 2). The presence of bacteria in rice field soil similar to M. capsulatus (confirmed by PCR gene amplification) shows similar methanol production as well. The maximum methanol production reported in previous literature was 50 mM (1.6 g/L) by Strain AS1 isolated from active anaerobic sludge grown under 50 % methane at 28 \u25e6 C in an external loop airlift bioreactor where the airlift reactor was constantly supplied with methane enriched NMS medium  (Ghaz-Jahanian  et  al.,  2018). Recently,  a  methanol  titre  of\n\n61.88  mM  was  achieved  a  customized  airlift  with  a  draft  tube  and microsparger  using Methylosinus  trichosporium NCIMB  11131. The design of the bioreactor and use of methane vector enhanced the volumetric mass transfer rate of methane resulting in a high methanol titre (Sahoo et al., 2023). The highest methanol titre reported so far is 64.6 mM that has been achieved by using co-culture of Metholosinus sporium and Methylocystis bryophila and a feed gas composition of methane (30 %) and hydrogen (5 -20 %) that was derived from anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation of rice straw (Patel et al., 2023).",
