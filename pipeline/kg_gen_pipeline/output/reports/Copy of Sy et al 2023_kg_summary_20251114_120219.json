Traditionally, kefir grains have been used for the fermentation of milk products to produce a fermented dairy beverage (3). The kefir grains itself are opaque 'beads' that are white in color and consist of a mixture of yeasts and bacteria surrounded by a polysaccharide and protein matrix to give its bead-like texture (4, 5). Kefir grains contain a very diverse and complex mixture of yeasts and bacteria consisting mainly of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), acetic acid bacteria, and yeasts consisting primarily of Saccharomyces, Candida, Kluyveromyces, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus , Leuconostoc , and Acetobacter (5, 6). During the primary fermentation process, sugar, water, and kefir grains are combined into a fermentation vessel and allowed to ferment aerobically for 24-48 h (7). After the primary fermentation process, the kefir grains are removed and other flavorings such as fruit juice, teas and herbs are added.",

        "text_evidence": "Ethanol may be present at varying levels within the final product due to the fermentation process, so it is vital to have a validated method to meet regulatory, quality, and safety requirements. Objective: This study describes using water kefir as a matrix for the evaluation of the previously validated method employing headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-GCMS) detection for ethanol in kombucha. This method will also evaluate the determination of methanol within the water kefir samples. Method: The matrix extension study was performed as per the AOAC INTERNATIONAL guidance documents outlined in Appendix K: Guidelines for Dietary Supplements and Botanicals using HS-GCMS for ethanol determination. Ethanol determination in each water kefir sample is quantified against an external standard calibration curve. The same instrumentation is used for methanol characterization. Results: RSDr and HorRat values obtained for from the study demonstrated acceptable precision with RSDr values of 1.03 to 6.68% and HorRat values determined to be between 0.23 and 1.52 for ethanol determination within kefir samples. Similarly, acceptable values of RSDr ranging from 1.45 to 3.39% and HorRat ranging from 0.25 to 0.49 were observed with methanol determination. For methanol determination, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) determined for the method in this study to be 16 and 21ppm, respectively. The methanol spike recovery study gave overall recoveries ranging from 89 to 91%, demonstrating acceptable method accuracy.\n\nConclusions: The results of this study demonstrate the previously validated HS-GCMS method for ethanol determination in kombucha can also be used to quantify ethanol in water kefir samples. The method is also suitable for the determination of methanol within water kefir samples. Highlights: A straightforward method has been adapted to include the the quantification of ethanol and methanol in fermented beverages such as Water Kefir samples. During the primary fermentation process, sugar, water, and kefir grains are combined into a fermentation vessel and allowed to ferment aerobically for 24-48 h (7). Ethanol, a byproduct of the fermentation process, can be produced as a result, but usually at low levels.",

Objective: This study describes using water kefir as a matrix for the evaluation of the previously validated method employing headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-GCMS) detection for ethanol in kombucha. The study objective is to demonstrate the method originally using kombucha is also fit for the analysis of water kefir. This method will also evaluate the determination of methanol within the water kefir samples. Ethanol determination in each water kefir sample is quantified against an external standard calibration curve. The methanol spike recovery study gave overall recoveries ranging from 89 to 91%, demonstrating acceptable method accuracy.\n\nConclusions: The results of this study demonstrate the previously validated HS-GCMS method for ethanol determination in kombucha can also be used to quantify ethanol in water kefir samples. The method is also suitable for the determination of methanol within water kefir samples. Highlights: A straightforward method has been adapted to include the the quantification of ethanol and methanol in fermented beverages such as Water Kefir samples. https://doi.org/10.1093/jaoacint/qsac125 Advance Access Publication Date: 20 October 2022 Research Article\n\nWater kefir is a tart and refreshing fermented beverage made up of water, sugar, and kefir grains. The final beverage can be flavored with fruit, juice, or herbs to make a variety of flavor profiles (1, 2). Water kefir is gaining in popularity as the rise in fermented beverages is increasing due to the potential health benefits associated with intestinal health. As water kefir is marketed as a nonalcoholic beverage and sold in retail grocery stores, it must have an alcohol by volume (ABV) level below < 0.5% in the United States and < 1.1% ABV in Canada to meet the regulatory requirements of each country.",

The linearity for ethanol over the desired range had already been established in the previous kombucha SLV study. The linearity for this analyte was further confirmed through the observation of linear curves and the calculated r 2 values > 0.999 for all standard curves used for ethanol quantification in this study. For methanol, all calibration curves prepared appeared linear upon visible inspection. The calculated r 2 values of all methanol calibration curves prepared was > 0.999, which demonstrated the linear response of the analyte over the evaluated range. The intermediate precision for ethanol was determined using quantitative data from the three days of analysis of samples with four replicates to calculate the between-day, within-day, and standard deviations for the method. Intermediate precision values ranged from 1.03 to 6.68% RSDr. For methanol determination, RSDr values for all three levels ranged from 1.45 to 3.39% and HorRat values ranged from 0.25 to 0.49. ato\n\n100'\n\nEthanol\n\nAbundance\n\n1200000\n\n1200000\n\n000001 L\n\n000000 1-\n\n900000\n\nnO0000\n\n700000\n\n600000\n\n..9\"..\n\n.4. . .91\n\nPropan-1-ol\n\n100000\n\n200000\n\n200000\n\n100000\n\nTim--\n\nMethanol\n\n2.00\n\n0.00\n\n5050000\n\n(d) Accuracy.

The linearity for ethanol over the desired range had already been established in the previous kombucha SLV study. The linearity for this analyte was further confirmed through the observation of linear curves and the calculated r 2 values > 0.999 for all standard curves used for ethanol quantification in this study. For methanol, all calibration curves prepared appeared linear upon visible inspection. The calculated r 2 values of all methanol calibration curves prepared was > 0.999, which demonstrated the linear response of the analyte over the evaluated range. The intermediate precision for ethanol was determined using quantitative data from the three days of analysis of samples with four replicates to calculate the between-day, within-day, and standard deviations for the method.

In each respective figure, the chromatograms show peaks for ethanol, propan-1-ol, and methanol and all are clearly separated from all other peaks seen in the sample.\n\n(b) Linearity. The linearity for ethanol over the desired range had already been established in the previous kombucha SLV study. The linearity for this analyte was further confirmed through the observation of linear curves and the calculated r 2 values > 0.999 for all standard curves used for ethanol quantification in this study. For methanol, all calibration curves prepared appeared linear upon visible inspection. The calculated r 2 values of all methanol calibration curves prepared was > 0.999, which demonstrated the linear response of the analyte over the evaluated range. The intermediate precision for ethanol was determined using quantitative data from the three days of analysis of samples with four replicates to calculate the between-day, within-day, and standard deviations for the method. For methanol determination, RSDr values for all three levels ranged from 1.45 to 3.39% and HorRat values ranged from 0.25 to 0.49. ato\n\n100'\n\nEthanol\n\nAbundance\n\n1200000\n\n1200000\n\n000001 L\n\n000000 1-\n\n900000\n\nnO0000\n\n700000\n\n600000\n\n..9\"..\n\n.4. . .91\n\nPropan-1-ol\n\n100000\n\n200000\n\n200000\n\n100000\n\nTim--\n\nMethanol\n\n2.00\n\n0.00\n\n5050000\n\n(d) Accuracy. Accuracy for this study was previously determined in the validation study of ethanol determination in kombucha. For methanol, the three spike levels gave mean recoveries of 91, 90, and 89%. These levels are within AOAC guidelines for typical acceptable recovery values for these analyte concentrations, demonstrating the method possesses acceptable accuracy for methanol determination (14). The previous SLV had reported the LOD and LOQ for ethanol as being 0.0002% ABV and 0.002% ABV, respectively. For methanol, the LOD\n\nEthanol and LOQ were determined for this method in this study to be 16 and 21 ppm, respectively.",
