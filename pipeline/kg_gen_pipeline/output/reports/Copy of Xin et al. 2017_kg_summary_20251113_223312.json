The amount of epoxyethane formed before cosubstrate regeneration was between 0.8 and 1.0 nmol/50 mg cells in approximately 8 h. Combining data from 7 batch experiments, the total production of epoxyethane was 2.2 nmol. Production of epoxyethane was improved (4.6 nmol) in 10% gas phase methane since methane acts as an abundant reductant for epoxidation.

In order to settle these problems, regeneration of cofactor NADH was performed in batch experiments with methane and methanol.

Production of epoxyethane was improved (4.6 nmol) in 10% gas phase methane since methane acts as an abundant reductant for epoxidation.

In addition to application in chemical manufacturing processes, epoxyethane is widely used in processes of food fumigating sterilization, particularly of grains and dried fruits [2]. Direct oxidation of ethylene to epoxyethane with molecular oxygen is a significant synthetic method for both industry and academia. One biocatalytic method for producing epoxyethane is using enzymes to insert oxygen across the carbon double bonds of ethylene. Epoxyethane synthesis by MMO catalysis has significant application potential as it is performed at normal temperature and pressure and causes no pollution. In spite of this progress, reaction conditions for biocatalytic ethylene epoxidation and the effect of epoxyethane on MMO catalytic performance have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim at using whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane from ethylene. The effect of epoxyethane concentration on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in batch experiments was studied.",

In addition to application in chemical manufacturing processes, epoxyethane is widely used in processes of food fumigating sterilization, particularly of grains and dried fruits [2]. Direct oxidation of ethylene to epoxyethane with molecular oxygen is a significant synthetic method for both industry and academia. One biocatalytic method for producing epoxyethane is using enzymes to insert oxygen across the carbon double bonds of ethylene. Epoxyethane synthesis by MMO catalysis has significant application potential as it is performed at normal temperature and pressure and causes no pollution. In spite of this progress, reaction conditions for biocatalytic ethylene epoxidation and the effect of epoxyethane on MMO catalytic performance have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim at using whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane from ethylene. The effect of epoxyethane concentration on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in batch experiments was studied.",

Here, 3 mmol/L methanol addition to ethylene epoxidation reaction led a stable level of the epoxyethane production. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min. This result indicates that epoxyethane has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011.

The production of epoxyethane from ethylene by cell suspension in the absence of methanol was nearly stopped when the batch reaction was repeated in the 6th batch cycle. Thus, methanol exhibits the potential to act as the electron-donating substrate to regenerate NADH and drive epoxyethane synthesis. Here, 3 mmol/L methanol addition to ethylene epoxidation reaction led a stable level of the epoxyethane production. However, the formation of epoxyethane in the presence of 1 mmol/L methanol was still stopped when the batch reaction was repeated for the 6th batch cycle. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane.

Thus, epoxyethane reacted very slowly with water and its reaction with water in the epoxyethane synthesis system was probably so slow as to be neglected. The structure of epoxyethane is similar to that of epoxypropane. However, epoxyethane is much more reactive because of the strain of the oxirane ring and the residual positive charge on the carbon atoms. The charge on the carbon atoms gives epoxyethane an electrophilic character. Thus, it is not surprising that epoxyethane is extremely reactive with nucleophilic molecules.

        "text_evidence": "Epoxyethane production by whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in the presence of different concentrations of methanol is shown in Figure 6. The production of epoxyethane from ethylene by cell suspension in the absence of methanol was nearly stopped when the batch reaction was repeated in the 6th batch cycle. Thus, methanol exhibits the potential to act as the electron-donating substrate to regenerate NADH and drive epoxyethane synthesis. Here, 3 mmol/L methanol addition to ethylene epoxidation reaction led a stable level of the epoxyethane production. However, the formation of epoxyethane in the presence of 1 mmol/L methanol was still stopped when the batch reaction was repeated for the 6th batch cycle. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min. This result indicates that epoxyethane has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011.

Khishen made water fully exposed throughout the experiment to the epoxyethane at ordinary temperature The recovery of the epoxyethane was almost complete after 24 h. Thus, epoxyethane reacted very slowly with water and its reaction with water in the epoxyethane synthesis system was probably so slow as to be neglected. The structure of epoxyethane is similar to that of epoxypropane. However, epoxyethane is much more reactive because of the strain of the oxirane ring and the residual positive charge on the carbon atoms. The charge on the carbon atoms gives epoxyethane an electrophilic character. Thus, it is not surprising that epoxyethane is extremely reactive with nucleophilic molecules.

However, the formation of epoxyethane in the presence of 1 mmol/L methanol was still stopped when the batch reaction was repeated for the 6th batch cycle. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min.

A major challenge in the biosynthesis process for the production of epoxyethane is inhibition of production.

Based on the present results, it is concluded that a whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 represents an efficient biocatalyst for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane. To make the application of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 on epoxyethane biosynthesis more feasible, uninterrupted reductant for ethylene epoxidation and continuous removal of toxic product are required.",
