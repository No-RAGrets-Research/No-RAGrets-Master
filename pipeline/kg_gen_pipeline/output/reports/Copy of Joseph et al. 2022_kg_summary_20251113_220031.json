Specifically, to achieve recombinant protein production from methylotrophic yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris , this organic solvent can be used as a sole carbon source for growth and maintenance as well as an inducer for protein expression. However, if methanol feeding is not controlled well in such a fermentation process, accumulation of the solvent in the growth media will have a detrimental effect on the cells.

However, if methanol feeding is not controlled well in such a fermentation process, accumulation of the solvent in the growth media will have a detrimental effect on the cells. Hence, monitoring the levels of methanol in these fermentation processes is a crucial step to ensure a healthy culture and maximum protein production. There are various techniques elaborated in the literature for monitoring\n\n*\n\ns\u0131\n\nSupporting Information\n\nmethanol in cell cultures, but often, they appear to be expensive methods that are less affordable for many laboratories. In this study, a fast, simple, and sensitive method is developed to process biological samples by using the salting-out-assisted liquid -liquid extraction technique to quantify the concentration of methanol and ethanol using gas chromatography. Followed by this, a validation test for the developed method was performed, which resulted in good peak resolution, linearity, and limit of detection for the quantitation of methanol and ethanol. Such an approach facilitates the possibility to monitor and control the methanol levels in fermentation and aids in bioprocess optimization.",

GC, specifically, is considered a precise and reliable method to determine low molecular weight volatile components 11,12 and has been extensively used in forensic and research labs. 13 In this method, the quantification is performed by coupling the headspace injection with the GC flame ionization detection (GC -FID) method using a capillary column. The gas phase is then injected into the GC for analysis. Additionally, compared to a conventional GC setup, the HSA requires thermostatic conditions ranging from 30 to 250 \u00b0 C. Moreover, compared to a conventionally used GC -FID design, the commonly used static headspace design requires a long time for reaching the interfacial equilibrium and gives unreliable storage stability of samples.",

Samples for GC should be prepared in a manner such that the high molecular weight components in the sample are removed. However, the steps necessary to remove interferences from such samples can be a tedious task depending on the complexity of the matrix. Several techniques have been recommended in the literature to quantify methanol in complex sample matrices. Some of these are (i) derivatization of sample matrices such as water -ethanol, 18 aqueous, 19 and alcohol; 20 (ii) direct injection of samples such as plasma, 21 whole blood, 22 alcohol, food products, 23 and wine; 24 (iii) HSA of wine, 28 One of the most important and widely used techniques for the separation of a volatile component from biological samples is extraction. In this type of treatment, extraction can be useful to separate the sample into two immiscible phases, and the analyte of interest can be recovered from the organic phase. The EE can be calculated from the amount of solute present in the extract relative to the total amount of solute present in the initial sample. Salting-out-assisted liquid -liquid extraction (SALLE) can, therefore, serve as a simple and costefficient method to separate the water-miscible organic solvent from aqueous biological samples within a short analysis time. It is a well-known technique traditionally used for sample clean-up processes and has been favored for several LC/MS/ MS bioanalyses. The biological samples contain particulates from the growth medium as well as the metabolites produced during the fermentation that can interfere with the analytical method by forming precipitates in the analytical instrument. Moreover, the high salt media, which is typically used for P. pastoris fermentation, and the sugars used for the growth of the organism need to be removed prior to injection of the sample as they can cause blockage in the chromatography column. The SALLE technique has not been reported in the literature for the quantification of methanol present in the samples retrieved from yeast bioprocesses.",

The specificity of the developed method was corroborated by injecting solutions containing pure methanol and ethanol. The concentration of the analytes studied to evaluate the effect of the sample matrix was set at 0.1% (w/v). The LOQ was taken as the lowest concentration of methanol and ethanol in the calibration curve that can be reproducibly quantified. For this, a sample containing a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) of methanol and ethanol was processed and injected three times within the same day to check intra-day precision. For this, a bioreactor experiment involving a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) methanol in BSM was conducted in the batch mode. The concentration of methanol present in the growth media during the fermentation was measured as a function of time using GC.",

Calibration curves for methanol and ethanol were prepared by injecting standard solutions ranging from 0.195 to 10 g/L. The specificity of the developed method was corroborated by injecting solutions containing pure methanol and ethanol. The concentration of the analytes studied to evaluate the effect of the sample matrix was set at 0.1% (w/v). The LOQ was taken as the lowest concentration of methanol and ethanol in the calibration curve that can be reproducibly quantified. For this, a sample containing a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) of methanol and ethanol was processed and injected three times within the same day to check intra-day precision. For this, a bioreactor experiment involving a concentration of 0.1% (w/v) methanol in BSM was conducted in the batch mode. The concentration of methanol present in the growth media during the fermentation was measured as a function of time using GC.",

The ratio between the area attained from an extracted sample and the area attained from a sample without extraction that has the same analyte concentration expressed as a percentage gives the EE of the considered process. A constant EE is required to obtain a linear calibration curve. To check this, the EE was tested for concentrations ranging from 0.049 to 100 g/L of methanol and ethanol. The recoveries calculated for a wide range of standard concentrations are plotted against the known concentration of the analyte before sample treatment. It was observed that the EE for methanol is virtually constant over a wide range of concentrations tested except for the two lowest concentrations: 0.098 and 0.049 g/ L. Hence, these values were eliminated from the calibration curve and are assumed to fall below the LOQ. In the case of ethanol, some discrepancies are noticed at extremely low concentrations. The recoveries attained for ethanol over a wide range of known concentrations are not constant. An increasing trend for extraction recoveries is noticed at lower concentrations (data not shown). These traces of ethanol in the solvent affect the extraction recoveries that are attained because the measured concentrations of ethanol are an overestimation of the real amount present. This can be achieved by finding a correlation between the concentration of ethanol present in the final extract ( C extract ), EE, extracted concentration from the sample ( C sample ), and concentration in the ethyl acetate ( C EtAc ), assuming a constant EE from the original sample irrespective of the sample concentration. Hence, a general equation denoting the relationship between the above can be given as\n\nThis equation includes the assumptions that the EE from the original sample is a constant and that the concentration of ethanol present in the final extract is the sum of the extracted concentration (EE * C sample ) and the concentration in the ethyl acetate C EtAc . From this correlation, the values of EE and C EtAc , which are independent of the concentration in the sample, can be estimated. Therefore, the EE and the concentration of ethanol in ethyl acetate C EtAc were estimated to be 94.24% and 0.134 g/L, respectively. The comparison of the ethanol concentration in the sample and the extract is made in Figure 3. This demonstrated a good agreement with the experimental extraction efficiencies and therefore confirmed the determination of the real extraction yield of 94.24% based on eq 2.\n\n6\n\n12\n\n12\n\nConcentration extract [In(g/L)]\n\n4\n\n10\n\nResponse area [In(A)]\n\n10\n\nResponse area [In(A)]\n\nco\n\n0\n\n6\n\n4\n\n-4\n\n-4\n\n2\n\n-2\n\n12\n\n10\n\n8\n\n2\n\n-2\n\nResponse area [in(A)]",

These traces of ethanol in the solvent affect the extraction recoveries that are attained because the measured concentrations of ethanol are an overestimation of the real amount present. The total quantity of ethanol in the final extract is a combination of the extracted quantity from the sample and the ethanol present in the solvent. Hence, the distribution between the extracted ethanol and the ethanol present in the solvent should be estimated. This can be achieved by finding a correlation between the concentration of ethanol present in the final extract ( C extract ), EE, extracted concentration from the sample ( C sample ), and concentration in the ethyl acetate ( C EtAc ), assuming a constant EE from the original sample irrespective of the sample concentration. Hence, a general equation denoting the relationship between the above can be given as\n\nThis equation includes the assumptions that the EE from the original sample is a constant and that the concentration of ethanol present in the final extract is the sum of the extracted concentration (EE * C sample ) and the concentration in the ethyl acetate C EtAc . Therefore, the EE and the concentration of ethanol in ethyl acetate C EtAc were estimated to be 94.24% and 0.134 g/L, respectively. The comparison of the ethanol concentration in the sample and the extract is made in Figure 3.",

As revealed by the chromatogram attained for methanol and ethanol, additional components are eluted at later retention times, indicating the presence of impurities in the solvent. These impurities are inevitable given that GC grade ethyl acetate was used, and they generally do not interfere with the analysis of methanol and ethanol. To substantiate the findings, the peak resolution ( R S ) of methanol and ethanol was calculated by using the halfwidth method with eq 1, where R 1 and R 2 are the retention times of ethanol and methanol, and W 1 and W 2 are the corresponding peak widths measured at half the peak height. Hence, the value confirms a good chromatographic separation of methanol and ethanol after extraction with the selected method. To achieve this, a neat blank, that is, a pure component (methanol/ethanol) in ethyl acetate without extraction, is injected into the GC. To check this, the EE was tested for concentrations ranging from 0.049 to 100 g/L of methanol and ethanol. It was observed that the EE for methanol is virtually constant over a wide range of concentrations tested except for the two lowest concentrations: 0.098 and 0.049 g/",

The discrepancies noted from the EE calculation of methanol and ethanol specifically for extremely low concentrations indicate the need for its elimination from the calibration curve. The linearity curve resulting from the elimination of these values (0.049 and 0.098 g/L) gives an R 2 value of 1.000 for methanol and 0.997 for ethanol samples. However, it should be considered that the linear parameters from the ethanol calibration curve are estimated without considering the ethanol present in ethyl acetate. Figure 4a,b shows the linearity achieved for methanol and ethanol in the concentration range 0.195 -100 g/L. Table 5 shows the parameters obtained for the calibration curves of the two analytes extracted using K2CO3 and ethyl acetate. The constant EE attained for methanol extraction supports the linearity of the calibration curve attained for this method. Furthermore, it is worthy to know the influence of C EtAc on the calibration curve of ethanol. A linear correlation can be made between the concentration of ethanol in the extract estimated previously ( C extract ) and peak area. Table 5 shows the data indicating the linearity parameters attained for methanol and ethanol concentration studied. As a result, the LOQ estimated from the calibration curve is 0.195 g/L for both methanol and ethanol. To confirm the reproducibility and accuracy of the measurement, the selected concentration (0.195 g/L) of methanol and ethanol was extracted 10 times, and each processed sample was injected three times using the selected GC -FID method. *\n\ncoefficient of variation attained for methanol and ethanol is 1.98 and 2.34%, respectively, showing an acceptable reproducibility. Therefore, the LOD value estimated for methanol was 0.012 g/L, and the LOQ value was taken as 0.195 g/L since it guarantees the linearity of the calibration curve. However, in the case of ethanol, the effect of ethyl acetate has to be taken into consideration due to the overestimation of the ethanol concentration in the extract. From the calibration curve constructed between the concentration of ethanol in the extract ( C extract ) and peak area ( A ), the following equation can be considered\n\nCombining eqs 2 and 4, the actual concentration of the sample can be estimated according to the equation\n\nTherefore, from the above correlation, the LOD for ethanol quantification was estimated to be 0.004 g/L. The LOQ and LOD values estimated for methanol and ethanol quantification are listed out in Table 6 along with the calibration equation.",

The discrepancies noted from the EE calculation of methanol and ethanol specifically for extremely low concentrations indicate the need for its elimination from the calibration curve. The linearity curve resulting from the elimination of these values (0.049 and 0.098 g/L) gives an R 2 value of 1.000 for methanol and 0.997 for ethanol samples. However, it should be considered that the linear parameters from the ethanol calibration curve are estimated without considering the ethanol present in ethyl acetate. Figure 4a,b shows the linearity achieved for methanol and ethanol in the concentration range 0.195 -100 g/L. Table 5 shows the parameters obtained for the calibration curves of the two analytes extracted using K2CO3 and ethyl acetate. The constant EE attained for methanol extraction supports the linearity of the calibration curve attained for this method. Furthermore, it is worthy to know the influence of C EtAc on the calibration curve of ethanol. A linear correlation can be made between the concentration of ethanol in the extract estimated previously ( C extract ) and peak area. Table 5 shows the data indicating the linearity parameters attained for methanol and ethanol concentration studied. As a result, the LOQ estimated from the calibration curve is 0.195 g/L for both methanol and ethanol. To confirm the reproducibility and accuracy of the measurement, the selected concentration (0.195 g/L) of methanol and ethanol was extracted 10 times, and each processed sample was injected three times using the selected GC -FID method. *\n\ncoefficient of variation attained for methanol and ethanol is 1.98 and 2.34%, respectively, showing an acceptable reproducibility.

The discrepancies noted from the EE calculation of methanol and ethanol specifically for extremely low concentrations indicate the need for its elimination from the calibration curve. The linearity curve resulting from the elimination of these values (0.049 and 0.098 g/L) gives an R 2 value of 1.000 for methanol and 0.997 for ethanol samples. However, it should be considered that the linear parameters from the ethanol calibration curve are estimated without considering the ethanol present in ethyl acetate. Figure 4a,b shows the linearity achieved for methanol and ethanol in the concentration range 0.195 -100 g/L. Table 5 shows the parameters obtained for the calibration curves of the two analytes extracted using K2CO3 and ethyl acetate. The constant EE attained for methanol extraction supports the linearity of the calibration curve attained for this method. Furthermore, it is worthy to know the influence of C EtAc on the calibration curve of ethanol. A linear correlation can be made between the concentration of ethanol in the extract estimated previously ( C extract ) and peak area. Table 5 shows the data indicating the linearity parameters attained for methanol and ethanol concentration studied. As a result, the LOQ estimated from the calibration curve is 0.195 g/L for both methanol and ethanol. To confirm the reproducibility and accuracy of the measurement, the selected concentration (0.195 g/L) of methanol and ethanol was extracted 10 times, and each processed sample was injected three times using the selected GC -FID method. *\n\ncoefficient of variation attained for methanol and ethanol is 1.98 and 2.34%, respectively, showing an acceptable reproducibility. Therefore, the LOD value estimated for methanol was 0.012 g/L, and the LOQ value was taken as 0.195 g/L since it guarantees the linearity of the calibration curve. However, in the case of ethanol, the effect of ethyl acetate has to be taken into consideration due to the overestimation of the ethanol concentration in the extract. From the calibration curve constructed between the concentration of ethanol in the extract ( C extract ) and peak area ( A ), the following equation can be considered\n\nCombining eqs 2 and 4, the actual concentration of the sample can be estimated according to the equation\n\nTherefore, from the above correlation, the LOD for ethanol quantification was estimated to be 0.004 g/L.

The discrepancies noted from the EE calculation of methanol and ethanol specifically for extremely low concentrations indicate the need for its elimination from the calibration curve. The linearity curve resulting from the elimination of these values (0.049 and 0.098 g/L) gives an R 2 value of 1.000 for methanol and 0.997 for ethanol samples. However, it should be considered that the linear parameters from the ethanol calibration curve are estimated without considering the ethanol present in ethyl acetate. Figure 4a,b shows the linearity achieved for methanol and ethanol in the concentration range 0.195 -100 g/L. Table 5 shows the parameters obtained for the calibration curves of the two analytes extracted using K2CO3 and ethyl acetate. The constant EE attained for methanol extraction supports the linearity of the calibration curve attained for this method. Furthermore, it is worthy to know the influence of C EtAc on the calibration curve of ethanol. A linear correlation can be made between the concentration of ethanol in the extract estimated previously ( C extract ) and peak area. Table 5 shows the data indicating the linearity parameters attained for methanol and ethanol concentration studied. As a result, the LOQ estimated from the calibration curve is 0.195 g/L for both methanol and ethanol. To confirm the reproducibility and accuracy of the measurement, the selected concentration (0.195 g/L) of methanol and ethanol was extracted 10 times, and each processed sample was injected three times using the selected GC -FID method. *\n\ncoefficient of variation attained for methanol and ethanol is 1.98 and 2.34%, respectively, showing an acceptable reproducibility. Therefore, the LOD value estimated for methanol was 0.012 g/L, and the LOQ value was taken as 0.195 g/L since it guarantees the linearity of the calibration curve. However, in the case of ethanol, the effect of ethyl acetate has to be taken into consideration due to the overestimation of the ethanol concentration in the extract. From the calibration curve constructed between the concentration of ethanol in the extract ( C extract ) and peak area ( A ), the following equation can be considered\n\nCombining eqs 2 and 4, the actual concentration of the sample can be estimated according to the equation\n\nTherefore, from the above correlation, the LOD for ethanol quantification was estimated to be 0.004 g/L. The LOQ and LOD values estimated for methanol and ethanol quantification are listed out in Table 6 along with the calibration equation.",

The discrepancies noted from the EE calculation of methanol and ethanol specifically for extremely low concentrations indicate the need for its elimination from the calibration curve. The linearity curve resulting from the elimination of these values (0.049 and 0.098 g/L) gives an R 2 value of 1.000 for methanol and 0.997 for ethanol samples. However, it should be considered that the linear parameters from the ethanol calibration curve are estimated without considering the ethanol present in ethyl acetate. Figure 4a,b shows the linearity achieved for methanol and ethanol in the concentration range 0.195 -100 g/L. Table 5 shows the parameters obtained for the calibration curves of the two analytes extracted using K2CO3 and ethyl acetate. The constant EE attained for methanol extraction supports the linearity of the calibration curve attained for this method. Furthermore, it is worthy to know the influence of C EtAc on the calibration curve of ethanol. A linear correlation can be made between the concentration of ethanol in the extract estimated previously ( C extract ) and peak area. Table 5 shows the data indicating the linearity parameters attained for methanol and ethanol concentration studied. As a result, the LOQ estimated from the calibration curve is 0.195 g/L for both methanol and ethanol. To confirm the reproducibility and accuracy of the measurement, the selected concentration (0.195 g/L) of methanol and ethanol was extracted 10 times, and each processed sample was injected three times using the selected GC -FID method. *\n\ncoefficient of variation attained for methanol and ethanol is 1.98 and 2.34%, respectively, showing an acceptable reproducibility. Therefore, the LOD value estimated for methanol was 0.012 g/L, and the LOQ value was taken as 0.195 g/L since it guarantees the linearity of the calibration curve. However, in the case of ethanol, the effect of ethyl acetate has to be taken into consideration due to the overestimation of the ethanol concentration in the extract. From the calibration curve constructed between the concentration of ethanol in the extract ( C extract ) and peak area ( A ), the following equation can be considered\n\nCombining eqs 2 and 4, the actual concentration of the sample can be estimated according to the equation\n\nTherefore, from the above correlation, the LOD for ethanol quantification was estimated to be 0.004 g/L.

The discrepancies noted from the EE calculation of methanol and ethanol specifically for extremely low concentrations indicate the need for its elimination from the calibration curve. The linearity curve resulting from the elimination of these values (0.049 and 0.098 g/L) gives an R 2 value of 1.000 for methanol and 0.997 for ethanol samples. However, it should be considered that the linear parameters from the ethanol calibration curve are estimated without considering the ethanol present in ethyl acetate. Figure 4a,b shows the linearity achieved for methanol and ethanol in the concentration range 0.195 -100 g/L. Table 5 shows the parameters obtained for the calibration curves of the two analytes extracted using K2CO3 and ethyl acetate. The constant EE attained for methanol extraction supports the linearity of the calibration curve attained for this method. Furthermore, it is worthy to know the influence of C EtAc on the calibration curve of ethanol. A linear correlation can be made between the concentration of ethanol in the extract estimated previously ( C extract ) and peak area. Table 5 shows the data indicating the linearity parameters attained for methanol and ethanol concentration studied. As a result, the LOQ estimated from the calibration curve is 0.195 g/L for both methanol and ethanol. To confirm the reproducibility and accuracy of the measurement, the selected concentration (0.195 g/L) of methanol and ethanol was extracted 10 times, and each processed sample was injected three times using the selected GC -FID method. *\n\ncoefficient of variation attained for methanol and ethanol is 1.98 and 2.34%, respectively, showing an acceptable reproducibility. Therefore, the LOD value estimated for methanol was 0.012 g/L, and the LOQ value was taken as 0.195 g/L since it guarantees the linearity of the calibration curve. However, in the case of ethanol, the effect of ethyl acetate has to be taken into consideration due to the overestimation of the ethanol concentration in the extract. From the calibration curve constructed between the concentration of ethanol in the extract ( C extract ) and peak area ( A ), the following equation can be considered\n\nCombining eqs 2 and 4, the actual concentration of the sample can be estimated according to the equation\n\nTherefore, from the above correlation, the LOD for ethanol quantification was estimated to be 0.004 g/L.

Each of these samples was treated using K2CO3 and ethyl acetate to quantify the methanol content at each time point. The organic phase containing the analyte of interest (methanol) was injected into the GC. To\n\nillustrate the change in methanol concentration throughout a P. pastoris fermentation process, a graph is plotted to indicate the consumption of methanol in a batch mode fermentation process together with the increase in cell biomass. This graph demonstrates that a smooth evolution of the methanol concentration as a function of time can be determined to monitor the bioprocesses. The accuracy of the developed method was verified by comparing with the accuracy of an HPLC method to assess the concentration of methanol present in the fermentation samples. First, a calibration curve was constructed and plotted for methanol samples ranging from 0.195 to 100 g/L as shown in Figure 7a. a) Methanol calibration\n\nIt was observed that the linearity attained using the HPLC method showed a lower coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), which was approximately 0.941 in comparison with the GC method. The adjusted calibration curve is indicated in Figure 7b, where a methanol concentration range of 1.563 -100 g/L was used, resulting in an R 2 value of 0.991. Based on the calibration curve attained from the HPLC method, the concentration of methanol in the bioreactor samples was estimated. It was observed from these results, as indicated in Figure 8, that the estimated values resulted in an initial concentration of 7.410 g/L, which was much lower than the actual initial concentration of 10 g/L of methanol in the sample. The differences observed in the estimated values of methanol from the HPLC analysis can be arising from interferences present in the methanol samples, which are not pretreated before injection. The SALLE technique, on the other hand, ensures the removal of these interferences from the samples, thereby ensuring the accurate estimation of methanol concentration.
