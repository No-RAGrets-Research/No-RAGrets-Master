Methanotrophic organisms with formally recognized names are classified into two distinct classes, namely, the Gammaproteobacteria (also referred to as type I and type X) and Alphaproteobacteria (also referred to as type II) classes (Mu\u00f1oz-G\u00f3mez et\u00a0al. 2022). Gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs are categorized within the Methylococcales order\n\nOuter membrane reductase),  MER  (methylene  H4MPT reductase),  MTD (methyleneH4MPT dehydrogenase), MTR (methyl-H4MPT:coenzyme M methyltransferase), NAR  (nitrate reductase), and NRF (nitrite reductase  ammonium-forming). Category I methanotrophs have been classified into three distinct groups. Type II methanotrophs pertain to the Alphaproteobacteria class and encompass representatives from the Methylocystaceae and Beijerinckiaceae families. Within the type II methanotrophs, there are closely affiliated clusters present in the validated species within the Methylocystis and\n\nMethylosinus genera. Specific characteristics that differentiate the genera of type II methanotrophs are outlined in Table\u00a04. On the other hand, type I methanotrophs are categorized as the 'high capacity' group, primarily inhabiting environments abundant in methane but lacking in oxygen. Conversely, the 'low capacity' type II methanotrophs prevail in environments with scant methane and ample oxygen. This distinction implies that varying types of methanotrophs\n\nmay partake in methane oxidation under diverse moisture conditions, as highlighted by Zhou et\u00a0al. (2020).",

        "text_evidence": "Methanotrophs, found widespread, offer potential for remediating contaminated sites. However, the available data suggests that despite its slower degradation rate, the particulate\n\nMMO (pMMO) ultimately proves to be the more efficient system. Within these strains, the pMMO is activated in the presence of acetate or ethanol, as observed in studies by Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. (2022). Such a strategy would be more feasible to implement in polluted sites compared to methane introduction and would additionally prevent competition for binding to the monooxygenase enzyme. As another example of bioremediation, Methylocella was among the bacteria associated with degradation of plastics in landfill lysimeters (Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. 2022). These microorganisms possess a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle but lack the enzymes associated with the Calvin-Benson cycle. Additionally, they engage in nitrogen fixation through an aerotolerant nitrogenase system. The prominent phospholipid fatty acid is 18:1v8c, and their DNA base compositions exhibit a range of 62 to 67 mol% G1C (Whiddon et\u00a0al. 2019; Le et\u00a0al. 2021)\n\ngrow relatively quickly and to high cell densities, have been exploited for production of single-cell protein (Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. 2022). While Methylocella , which exhibits slower grow, may not be as useful to produce low value, bulk chemicals, it can still be grown to high cell densities in fermenter culture (Priyadarsini et\u00a0al. 2023). Its metabolic versatility warrants further examination in this respect. Large-scale production of methanol from methane is an attractive proposition and promising results have been obtained in several studies (Baba and Miyaji 2020). As an illustration, combinations of Methylomonas methanica and Methylocella tundra co-cultures, which were encapsulated within silica gel, were supplied with simulated biogas as a nutrient source. It  is  worth  noting  that  the  introduction  of  hydrogen resulted in a significant enhancement in methanol production, nearly doubling it to approximately 0.32 g   l -1 , with a corresponding 66% conversion efficiency (Zhou et\u00a0al. 2020). However, a notable challenge in utilizing the MMO for methanol production lies in the need for a costly electron donor, such as formate, to facilitate methane oxidation. Nonetheless, a promising solution may be found in facultative methanotrophs, as they possess the capability to utilize compounds like acetate, which are commonly found in waste streams, as an alternative electron donor (Lee et\u00a0al. 2023). exhibit a wider array of metabolic capabilities compared to obligatory methanotrophs, their potential biocatalytic applications have not been fully explored. The soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) has traditionally been recognized as an exceptionally versatile biocatalyst, facilitating the oxidation of a diverse spectrum of compounds, including alkanes, alkenes, and even relatively large aromatics like naphthalene (Priyadarsini et\u00a0al. 2023). However, the toxicity associated with this metabolite necessitates the implementation of a recycling system to regenerate the entire-cell biocatalyst (Samanta and Sani 2023). If Methylocella demonstrates reduced susceptibility to the adverse effects of propylene epoxide, it could potentially have an advantage over M. capsulatus in the production of this compound. This advantage stems from Methylocella ability to harness alternative energy sources for facilitating the oxidation of propylene through the sMMO enzyme.",

MDH exists as an \u03b1 2 \u03b22 tetramer, composed of large (60 to 67 kDa) and small (8.5 kDa) subunits (Le and Lee 2022). The transfer of electrons from MDH to cytochrome c L , an atypical cytochrome serving as the specific electron acceptor for MDH, is the subsequent step (Tikhonova et\u00a0al. 2023). Importantly, all three components-MDH, cytochrome c L , and cytochrome c H -are soluble and reside within the periplasm of gramnegative methylotrophs (Tentori et\u00a0al. 2022). In contrast, gram-positive methylotrophs employ an NAD-linked MDH for methanol oxidation, while methanol-oxidizing yeast species use a methanol oxidase system for the same purpose. The regulation of MDH (malate dehydrogenase) synthesis involves complex regulatory networks in facultative methylotrophs and is at least present in one methanotrophic organism. A comprehensive understanding of the control mechanisms governing MDH synthesis has been extensively explored in previous literature (Howe et\u00a0al. 2023; Venetz et\u00a0al. 2022).\n\n371 studies\n\n12503 sequence reads",

In contrast, gram-positive methylotrophs employ an NAD-linked MDH for methanol oxidation, while methanol-oxidizing yeast species use a methanol oxidase system for the same purpose. The regulation of MDH (malate dehydrogenase) synthesis involves complex regulatory networks in facultative methylotrophs and is at least present in one methanotrophic organism. A comprehensive understanding of the control mechanisms governing MDH synthesis has been extensively explored in previous literature (Howe et\u00a0al. 2023; Venetz et\u00a0al. 2022).\n\n371 studies\n\n12503 sequence reads",

In contrast to the comprehensive exploration of methane (C1) metabolism, the breakdown of gaseous alkanes ranging from C2 to C5 among methanotrophs has received limited attention (as depicted in Fig.\u00a05). A noteworthy case lies with the type II methanotroph, Methylocella silvestris , which exhibits the capability to utilize both methane and propane as sources of carbon and energy. This distinct trait marks M. silvestris as the initial methanotroph known to utilize a short-chain alkane instead of methane. Furthermore, M. silvestris is equipped to metabolize ethane through oxidation processes. The presence of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase explains its ability to thrive on ethane and its metabolic intermediates ethanol and acetate (Bordel et\u00a0al. 2019). In addition to ethane assimilation, propane assimilation pathways have also been observed in M. silvestris (Bordel et\u00a0al. 2019) and Methylacidiphilum sp.",

In contrast to the comprehensive exploration of methane (C1) metabolism, the breakdown of gaseous alkanes ranging from C2 to C5 among methanotrophs has received limited attention (as depicted in Fig.\u00a05). A noteworthy case lies with the type II methanotroph, Methylocella silvestris , which exhibits the capability to utilize both methane and propane as sources of carbon and energy. This distinct trait marks M. silvestris as the initial methanotroph known to utilize a short-chain alkane instead of methane. Furthermore, M. silvestris is equipped to metabolize ethane through oxidation processes. The presence of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase explains its ability to thrive on ethane and its metabolic intermediates ethanol and acetate (Bordel et\u00a0al. 2019). In addition to ethane assimilation, propane assimilation pathways have also been observed in M. silvestris (Bordel et\u00a0al. 2019) and Methylacidiphilum sp.",

In contrast to the comprehensive exploration of methane (C1) metabolism, the breakdown of gaseous alkanes ranging from C2 to C5 among methanotrophs has received limited attention (as depicted in Fig.\u00a05). A noteworthy case lies with the type II methanotroph, Methylocella silvestris , which exhibits the capability to utilize both methane and propane as sources of carbon and energy. This distinct trait marks M. silvestris as the initial methanotroph known to utilize a short-chain alkane instead of methane.",

Glycerol undergoes a two-step conversion into DHAP (dihydroxyacetone  phosphate),  subsequently  entering the metabolic network (Rozova et\u00a0al. 2021). Through the overexpression of these four genes, noticeable cell growth was observed on glycerol alone, resulting in a final OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) of 1.4 when using 0.1% (v/v) glycerol. However, the genetically engineered strain encountered growth challenges in the presence of higher glycerol concentrations, specifically 0.5% (v/v) and 1% (v/v) (Tyne et\u00a0al. 2023). This was attributed to the hypothesis that elevated glycerol concentrations might significantly influence osmotic potential, consequently hindering growth (Pham et\u00a0al. 2023).",

Interestingly, mmoB lies between mmoY and mmoZ ; an ORF of unknown function, designated orfY , with a coding capacity of 12 kDa, lies between mmoZ and mmoC in all genes clusters analyzed to date (Guo et\u00a0al. 2022). The genes encoding pMMO from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) have been cloned and sequenced (Dawson et\u00a0al. 2023) and are clustered on the chromosome in the order pmoCAB (Fig.\u00a07B). There are two virtually identical copies of these genes (13 bp changes over 3183 bp of pmoCAB ) present in the genome of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and a third copy of pmoC has also been identified (Bo et\u00a0al. 2023).
