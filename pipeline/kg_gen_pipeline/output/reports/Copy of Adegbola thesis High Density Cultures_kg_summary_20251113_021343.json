This study investigated the growth of M. trichosporium on the water soluble carbon source, methanol while retaining sMMO activity. Methanol was found to completely inhibit growth at 40 g/L. For online methanol measurements  during  fed-batch  cultivation,  an in  situ probe  was  constructed  from autoclavable materials and equipped with a Figaro TGS822 vapor sensor. The  probe  was  an  essential  component  of  a  feedback  methanol  control system. The  cumulative  CO2  production  (CCP)  strategy  was  used  to  feed  methanol  in fed-batch experiments. The  subsequent  bioreactor\n\nstudy  involved  feeding  of  nutrients  based  on  their  yields  in  relation  to  methanol,  a biomass density of 62 g/L (growth rate of 0.034- 0.08 h -1 ) The enzyme activity in methanol grown cells was recovered by subculturing in liquid NMS medium with methane as the sole carbon source, the activity increased from 8 to 600 [\u00b5mol naphthol][g of biomass] -1 It is recommended that further studies be carried out on stimulating sMMO activity during cultivation on methanol.",

        "text_evidence": "Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a wild type, obligate methanotroph that grows only on one-carbon compounds and, in the absence of copper, produces high levels of soluble methane  monooxygenase  (sMMO)  to  metabolize  methane  to  methanol. SMMO  has gained a great deal of attention in the bioremediation and chemical industries because of its  low  substrate  specificity  and  its  ability  to  oxidize  chlorinated  hydrocarbons. This study investigated the growth of M. trichosporium on the water soluble carbon source, methanol while retaining sMMO activity. A biomass density  of  19  g/L  (growth  rate  of  0.013-0.065  h -1 )  was  achieved  with  sMMO activity  of  300  to  500  [\u00b5mol  naphthol][g  of  biomass] -1 After  6  months  of subsequent  plate  transfers, M.  trichosporium lost  the  ability  to  produce  high  levels  of sMMO. It is recommended that further studies be carried out on stimulating sMMO activity during cultivation on methanol.",

There are two types of methane  monooxygenase  (MMO),  the  particulate  form  (pMMO)  and  the  soluble  form (sMMO). Due  to  its  low  substrate  specificity,  sMMO  has  been  studied  for  use  in  the bioremediation  industry for the degradation of a host of  contaminants  including naphthalene  (Cardinal  and  Stenstrom,  1991),  trichloroethylene  (Brusseau  et  al.,  1990; For instance, the degradation of trichloroethylene, a recalcitrant carcinogenic groundwater contaminant (Canadian Council  of  Ministers  of  the  Environment  2006),  is  facilitated  by  sMMO  via  an epoxidation  reaction. Degradation\n\nrates  of  TCE  by  sMMO  expressing  cultures  of  M.  trichosporium  OB3b  have  been reported to be up to three orders of magnitude faster than those observed in other TCE degraders (Table 1-1). M. trichosporium OB3b is a wild type that has been shown to produce high levels of sMMO in comparison to other sMMO producers (Bowman and Sayler, 1994). Since sMMO is a growth associated enzyme, high cell density cultivation of M. trichosporium OB3b could result in increased enzyme production.

There are two types of methane  monooxygenase  (MMO),  the  particulate  form  (pMMO)  and  the  soluble  form (sMMO). Due  to  its  low  substrate  specificity,  sMMO  has  been  studied  for  use  in  the bioremediation  industry for the degradation of a host of  contaminants  including naphthalene  (Cardinal  and  Stenstrom,  1991),  trichloroethylene  (Brusseau  et  al.,  1990; Tsien  et  al.,  1989),  dichloroethane  (Oldenhuis  et  al.,  1989),  vinyl  chloride  (Fox  et  al., 1990) and cyclopropane (Dalton et al., 1981). For instance, the degradation of trichloroethylene, a recalcitrant carcinogenic groundwater contaminant (Canadian Council  of  Ministers  of  the  Environment  2006),  is  facilitated  by  sMMO  via  an epoxidation  reaction. Degradation\n\nrates  of  TCE  by  sMMO  expressing  cultures  of  M.  trichosporium  OB3b  have  been reported to be up to three orders of magnitude faster than those observed in other TCE degraders (Table 1-1). M. trichosporium OB3b is a wild type that has been shown to produce high levels of sMMO in comparison to other sMMO producers (Bowman and Sayler, 1994). Since sMMO is a growth associated enzyme, high cell density cultivation of M. trichosporium OB3b could result in increased enzyme production. This study investigates the cultivation of M. trichosporium OB3b on methanol to achieve high biomass concentrations whilst retaining sMMO activity.",

Since the rate of methanol volatilization is affected by temperature and pressure both were kept constant for  every  experiment. Given  that  the  air  flow  rate  through  the  probe  affects  how  fast methanol vapor is delivered from the membrane chamber to the sensor, an increase in airflow was expected to decrease the response time. A  step  change  in  liquid  methanol concentration from 1 to 2 g/L resulted in similar sensor response times (approximately 12 min)  at  each  flow  rate  (Figure  3-2). There  was  negligible  effect  of  the  corresponding residence times at the different flow rates because the actual residence time in the probe was quite low in comparison to the overall response time. At a flow rate of 19 ml/min it takes approximately 0.5 seconds to transport methanol from the membrane chamber to the  sensor  (calculated  based  on  the  probe  length  of  1.5  ft  and  PTFE  tube  diameter  of 1/4') and 0.15 seconds at a flow rate of 60 mL/min. 1.3\n\n1.6\n\n1.2\n\n1.4 -\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nSensor output (V)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0-0-0-0\n\nSASsSSASs\n\n+00-30000090\n\n10\n\n15\n\nTime (min)\n\n20\n\n25\n\n2\n\n3\n\nMethanol concentration (g/L)\n\n4\n\n5\n\nThe response of the sensor to changes in methanol concentrations was not linear (Figure 3-3). The  second effect  is  a  result  of  the  non-linear  physical-chemical  interaction  between  the  detector, oxygen  and  methanol. For  the  methanol  sensor,  in  the absence  of  methanol,  the  chemisorption  of  oxygen  depletes  the  conduction  electrons available  at  the  surface  which  lowers  the  overall  conductivity. When  methanol  is  in contact with the detector, it adsorbs to the surface and the semiconductor catalyzes the reduction of surface-bound oxygen, producing the more weakly interacting formaldehyde that  desorbs  and  frees  surface  conduction  band  electrons  which  in  turn,  increases  the measured conductivity (Guarna et al., 1997).",

Methanol was fed semi-continuously based on cumulative methanol consumption estimation. The cumulative methanol consumption (CMC) was estimated online every 10 seconds (Equation 4-2) based on both real time CCP  measurements  and  yield computation  (YCO2/CH3OH). The  yield  of  carbon  dioxide  from  methanol  was  calculated online every 15 min (Equation 4-3). The amount of methanol fed was kept equal to the estimated CMC (Figure 4-1), thus maintaining a constant methanol concentration in the bioreactor. To  prevent  an accidental overshoot in methanol  concentration  in the bioreactor,  in  addition  to  the  CCP  feeding  strategy,  a  fail-safe  feedback  control  was implemented. The Figaro sensor was used to detect methanol online and the upper set point limit was 2 g/L methanol. In the event that the methanol concentration exceeds 2 g/L, the methanol feed pump is turned off (Figure 4-2). (Equation 4-2)\n\nWhere CMC is cumulative methanol consumed (g) at time, t and CCP is cumulative CO2 produced (g) measured at any time, t. YCO2/CH3OH is the yield of CO2 to methanol (g/g).

Allylthiourea acts as a copper chelator (Hubley et al., 1975), limiting cell access to copper and thus promoting the switch from pMMO to sMMO production. Therefore, the addition of allylthiourea to the growth medium should sequester the available copper and increase sMMO production. In the methanol cultures, sMMO activity is about two orders of magnitude lower than the nominal range of 300 to 600 [\u00b5mol naphthol][g of biomass ]-1 There  was  no  significant  impact  of  15  \u00b5M  allylthiourea  on  enzyme activity in methanol grown cells (Table 5-2). It is probable that for the cultures\n\ngrowing on methanol, there was little driving force to stimulate the production of sMMO because it is not required by the cells for methanol metabolism. However in the methanecultivated cells, the enzyme is necessary for methane metabolism, thus the cells had to produce  sMMO  for  survival. The  methane  grown  cultures  without  allylthiourea  had higher biomass density and sMMO activity than cells grown in medium containing 15 \u00b5M  allylthiourea. The  copper  content  in  medium  B  was  less  than  0.01  ppm,  since allylthiourea is a metal chelator, with an affinity for ions with a 2+ charge, it is likely that with  such  a  low  Cu 2+ concentration  in  the  growth  medium,  allylthiourea  may  have sequestered another cation such as Fe 2+ which is required for sMMO production. Fe 2+ has been  shown  by  Shah  et  al.,  (1992)  to  be  required  for  high  levels  of  sMMO  synthesis. Therefore allylthiourea was not necessary to promote sMMO production since there was a low level of copper in the growth medium.",

Therefore, the addition of allylthiourea to the growth medium should sequester the available copper and increase sMMO production. In the methanol cultures, sMMO activity is about two orders of magnitude lower than the nominal range of 300 to 600 [\u00b5mol naphthol][g of biomass ]-1 It is probable that for the cultures\n\ngrowing on methanol, there was little driving force to stimulate the production of sMMO because it is not required by the cells for methanol metabolism. However in the methanecultivated cells, the enzyme is necessary for methane metabolism, thus the cells had to produce  sMMO  for  survival. The  methane  grown  cultures  without  allylthiourea  had higher biomass density and sMMO activity than cells grown in medium containing 15 \u00b5M  allylthiourea. The  copper  content  in  medium  B  was  less  than  0.01  ppm,  since allylthiourea is a metal chelator, with an affinity for ions with a 2+ charge, it is likely that with  such  a  low  Cu 2+ concentration  in  the  growth  medium,  allylthiourea  may  have sequestered another cation such as Fe 2+ which is required for sMMO production. Fe 2+ has been  shown  by  Shah  et  al.,  (1992)  to  be  required  for  high  levels  of  sMMO  synthesis. Therefore allylthiourea was not necessary to promote sMMO production since there was a low level of copper in the growth medium.",
