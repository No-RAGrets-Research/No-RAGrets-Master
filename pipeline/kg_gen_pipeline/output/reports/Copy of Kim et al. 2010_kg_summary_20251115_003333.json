        "text_evidence": "These  problems  can  be  solved  by  the conversion of methane to methanol. Methanol is used as a fuel for heat engines and fuel cells and can be converted by dehydration to  dimethyl ether (DME), a good diesel fuel with a higher octane rating than regular diesel fuel. Methanol is produced exclusively from methane, by processing syngas under conditions of high temperature and pressure. In  recent  years,  however,  investigators  have  explored  the biological  production  of  methanol  under  ambient  conditions. The first step in the metabolism of methane is its conversion to methanol by the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO, EC  1.14.13.25). Methanol  is  converted  subsequently  to formaldehyde  by  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH,  EC 1.1.99.8), which is coupled to the electron transport chain at the level of cytochrome c L The  production  of methanol using a methanotrophic bacterium requires  that oxidation of methanol be prevented, so that methanol can be excreted into the medium [2,3]. We  have optimized methanol biosynthesis in M. trichosporium OB3b by  using  high  NaCl  concentrations  to  create  conditions inhibiting  MDH  activity,  while  retaining  MMO  activity [4]. The  high  salt  concentration  inhibits  the  transfer  of\n\nelectrons from MDH to cytochrome c L that occurs during the  oxidation  of  methanol,  resulting  in  the  excretion  of methanol  to  medium. In this study, we have further improved methanol production  by  introducing  EDTA  as  an  MDH  inhibitor, allowing  us  to  reduce  the  concentration  of  NaCl  and  its deleterious  effects  on  cell  morphology. In  addition,  we developed a repeated batch technique for the production of lab-scale batches of methanol.",

Lab-scale  methanol  production  was  designed  in  a  3  L reactor with 1 L working volume. Produced  methanol  was\n\n2 Springer\n\nD\n\nConstant temperature chamber\n\nF",

There was a concentration-related decrease in methanol production  when  EDTA was increased to 2  and  3  mM. This  is likely due to the effects of EDTA on metalloprotein enzymes such as MDH and pMMO, whose activities are inhibited by the metal chelator. The concentration of methanol in the cell suspension (100 mL, 0.6 mg dry cells/mL) treated with 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 mM sodium formate peaked at 13.2 mM methanol after 12 h, and remained steady thereafter (Fig. 4).",

There was a concentration-related decrease in methanol production  when  EDTA was increased to 2  and  3  mM. This  is likely due to the effects of EDTA on metalloprotein enzymes such as MDH and pMMO, whose activities are inhibited by the metal chelator. The concentration of methanol in the cell suspension (100 mL, 0.6 mg dry cells/mL) treated with 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 mM sodium formate peaked at 13.2 mM methanol after 12 h, and remained steady thereafter (Fig. 4).",
