        "text_evidence": "Finally, a  simple  gas-solid heterogeneous bioreactor system  was successfully demonstrated for the  continuous production of  propylene oxide. The  bioreactor was  equipped with a  jacket  for circulating water  to  control reaction temperature. The mixture  of  gaseous  substrates (a  mixture  of propylene  and oxygen 1:1, v/v)  was  introduced through  a water  bottle 6 (which  was maintained at 40  \u00b0  C) to  pick  up moisture and  then  into the  bottom of  the  gas-solid bioreactor 1. The temperature of  the bioreactor was kept  at 40  \u00b0  C (above  the  boiling point of product  propylene  oxide,  35 \u00b0  C). The  gaseous phase of the bioreactor was  evacuated  and then  was filled with  the  gaseous  substrate mixture. The  gas  mixture was  then  introduced continuously into  the bioreactor at a flow rate  of about  0.5 ml/min. The relative humidity  inside  the bioreactor  was  maintained at about  70%. In situ  regeneration of the biocatalyst in the bioreactor was  conducted after  12 h  of operation using  methanol as the regeneration substrate. The  air  was  forced to pass through a methanol  bottle 7 (maintained at  40 \u00b0  C) and  then  into the bioreactor, carrying  methanol vapor with it. Microbial cells  of other methanotrophic  bacteria were  also tested in  this heterogeneous bioreactor. Data shown in Table 1 indicated  that  this  bioreactor can be applied  to the cells of other  methanotrophs. This has been accomplished by  maintaining  the  temperature  of  the gas-solid bioreactor at  greater than 40  \u00b0  C. In addition,  the amount  of water used in our gas-solid bioreactor is  significantly less  in  comparison  to  the conventional  gas-liquid bioreactor  system. Although  we have not optimized  the  reaction conditions for  this  heterogeneous gas-solid  bioreactor  with  a  particular methanotrophic strain, this  paper  demonstrates the feasibility of using  this new type  of  bioreactor for  the production  of chemicals  from gaseous  substrates.",

The  bioreactor was  equipped with a  jacket  for circulating water  to  control reaction temperature. The mixture  of  gaseous  substrates (a  mixture  of propylene  and oxygen 1:1, v/v)  was  introduced through  a water  bottle 6 (which  was maintained at 40  \u00b0  C) to  pick  up moisture and  then  into the  bottom of  the  gas-solid bioreactor 1. The temperature of  the bioreactor was kept  at 40  \u00b0  C (above  the  boiling point of product  propylene  oxide,  35 \u00b0  C). The  gaseous phase of the bioreactor was  evacuated  and then  was filled with  the  gaseous  substrate mixture. The  gas  mixture was  then  introduced continuously into  the bioreactor at a flow rate  of about  0.5 ml/min. The relative humidity  inside  the bioreactor  was  maintained at about  70%. In situ  regeneration of the biocatalyst in the bioreactor was  conducted after  12 h  of operation using  methanol as the regeneration substrate. The  air  was  forced to pass through a methanol  bottle 7 (maintained at  40 \u00b0  C) and  then  into the bioreactor, carrying  methanol vapor with it. Microbial cells  of other methanotrophic  bacteria were  also tested in  this heterogeneous bioreactor. Data shown in Table 1 indicated  that  this  bioreactor can be applied  to the cells of other  methanotrophs. This has been accomplished by  maintaining  the  temperature  of  the gas-solid bioreactor at  greater than 40  \u00b0  C. In addition,  the amount  of water used in our gas-solid bioreactor is  significantly less  in  comparison  to  the conventional  gas-liquid bioreactor  system. Although  we have not optimized  the  reaction conditions for  this  heterogeneous gas-solid  bioreactor  with  a  particular methanotrophic strain, this  paper  demonstrates the feasibility of using  this new type  of  bioreactor for  the production  of chemicals  from gaseous  substrates.",
