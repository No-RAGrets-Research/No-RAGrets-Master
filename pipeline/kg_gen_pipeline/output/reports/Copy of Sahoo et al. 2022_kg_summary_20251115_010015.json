Methane has a global warming potential 28 -36 times that of CO2 over a 100-year-timescale (US EPA, 2020). Furthermore, the global emission of methane stands at 570 million tonnes, of which 342 million tonnes is accounted for by anthropogenic sources, while the residual 228 million tonnes  originate  from  natural  reserves  ( e.g. ,  wetlands,  sediments, oceans,  termites,  biodegradation  of  organic  wastes  by  methanogens, etc.) (IEA, Methane Tracker, 2020). The study demonstrates a two-stage integrated process for bio-methanol production using Methylosinus trichosporium NCIMB 11131, coupled with sequestration of methane and carbon dioxide. The first stage involved generation of methanotrophic biomass via sequestration of methane; which was used as biocatalyst to reduce carbon dioxide into methanol in the second stage. GLYPH<0> 1 were achieved in semi-batch stirred tank reactor with methane concentration in the inlet gas mixture of 2.5% v/v and gas flow rate of 0.5 vvm. Methane fixation rate was estimated to be 0.32 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d Subsequently, a kinetic model was developed to predict and understand the system  behaviour  in  terms  of  dynamic  profile  of  growth,  methanol  formation,  concentration  of  dissolved methane or carbon dioxide in the aqueous phase and headspace carbon dioxide concentration, in response to varying process parameters.",

The first stage involved generation of methanotrophic biomass via sequestration of methane; which was used as biocatalyst to reduce carbon dioxide into methanol in the second stage. Maximum methanol titer of 0.58 g L GLYPH<0> 1 was achieved at headspace carbon dioxide concentration of 50% v/v and liquid to headspace volume ratio 10:90. Subsequently, a kinetic model was developed to predict and understand the system  behaviour  in  terms  of  dynamic  profile  of  growth,  methanol  formation,  concentration  of  dissolved methane or carbon dioxide in the aqueous phase and headspace carbon dioxide concentration, in response to varying process parameters. Methanol, a widely used industrial solvent, is also known to be the precursor for synthesizing other chemicals like formaldehyde, acetic acid, dimethyl ether, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (Dalena et al., 2018). Methanol is being considered as a potential transportation fuel owing to its high specific energy ratio, high heat of vaporization, low  combustion  temperature,  high  flame  speed  and  so  on  (Verhelst et al., 2019). Although CH4  is also used as a fuel, methanol stands superior to CH4  in several ways: (i) methanol is a liquid at STP, which facilitates  easy  and  safe  storage  and  transportation  with  minimum product loss; (ii) methanol possesses 488-times greater volumetric energy content (15,871 MJ m GLYPH<0> 3 )  as  compared  to  CH4  (32.50  MJ  m GLYPH<0> 3 ) (Verhelst et al., 2019). Methanol  can  be  produced  through  chemical  or  biological  route. Chemical synthesis of methanol may be achieved either through catalytic oxidation of CH4 or via catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. However, the conventionally used chemical routes for methanol production are constrained  by  the  requirement  of:  (i)  expensive  catalysts e.g. ,  CuO/ ZnO/Al2O3, Fe2O3(MoO3)3, MoO3/SiO2, MoO3/Ga2O3, V2O5/SiO2, etc .",

Furthermore, the global emission of methane stands at 570 million tonnes, of which 342 million tonnes is accounted for by anthropogenic sources, while the residual 228 million tonnes  originate  from  natural  reserves  ( e.g. ,  wetlands,  sediments, oceans,  termites,  biodegradation  of  organic  wastes  by  methanogens, etc.) (IEA, Methane Tracker, 2020). The study demonstrates a two-stage integrated process for bio-methanol production using Methylosinus trichosporium NCIMB 11131, coupled with sequestration of methane and carbon dioxide. The first stage involved generation of methanotrophic biomass via sequestration of methane; which was used as biocatalyst to reduce carbon dioxide into methanol in the second stage.

The first stage involved generation of methanotrophic biomass via sequestration of methane; which was used as biocatalyst to reduce carbon dioxide into methanol in the second stage. Maximum methanol titer of 0.58 g L GLYPH<0> 1 was achieved at headspace carbon dioxide concentration of 50% v/v and liquid to headspace volume ratio 10:90.

Methanol, a widely used industrial solvent, is also known to be the precursor for synthesizing other chemicals like formaldehyde, acetic acid, dimethyl ether, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (Dalena et al., 2018). Methanol is being considered as a potential transportation fuel owing to its high specific energy ratio, high heat of vaporization, low  combustion  temperature,  high  flame  speed  and  so  on  (Verhelst et al., 2019). Although CH4  is also used as a fuel, methanol stands superior to CH4  in several ways: (i) methanol is a liquid at STP, which facilitates  easy  and  safe  storage  and  transportation  with  minimum product loss; (ii) methanol possesses 488-times greater volumetric energy content (15,871 MJ m GLYPH<0> 3 )  as  compared  to  CH4  (32.50  MJ  m GLYPH<0> 3 ) (Verhelst et al., 2019). Methanol  can  be  produced  through  chemical  or  biological  route. Chemical synthesis of methanol may be achieved either through catalytic oxidation of CH4 or via catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. However, the conventionally used chemical routes for methanol production are constrained  by  the  requirement  of:  (i)  expensive  catalysts e.g. ,  CuO/ ZnO/Al2O3, Fe2O3(MoO3)3, MoO3/SiO2, MoO3/Ga2O3, V2O5/SiO2, etc .",

        "text_evidence": "Alternatively, methanol can be produced biologically with the application of methanotrophic microorganisms as biocatalyst. Mardina et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2016b; Patel et al., 2020a, b, c), etc. for methanol production using noxious C1-carbon compounds, like CH4  and CO2. Methanotrophs are Gram-negative proteobacteria that utilize methane as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth. Methane, bio-sequestered by methanotrophs, is catalytically oxidized into methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO), an endogenous irreversible enzyme. The produced methanol is subsequently converted into formaldehyde, formate, and CO2 via sequential oxidations catalysed by three reversible  enzymes:  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH),  formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, respectively (Sahoo et al., 2021). Methanotrophs are broadly classified into three types on the basis of the type of MMO synthesized. Type I methanotrophs ( e.g. , species of Methylosoma , Methylothermus , Methylosarcina , Methylosphaera , Methylohalobius , Methylomonas , Methylobacter , Methylomicrobium , Crenothrix and Clonothrix ) express particulate MMO; Type II methanotrophs ( e.g. , species  of Methylocapsa , Methylocella , Methylosinus and Methylocystis ) express both soluble and particulate MMO; and Type X methanotrophs ( e.g. , species of Methylococcus and Methylocaldum ) express certain specific properties of both Type I and Type II methanotrophs (Sahoo et al., 2021). For utilizing C1-carbon sources, Type I and Type X methanotrophs  use  RuMP  pathway,  while  Type  II  methanotrophs  use  serine pathway (Sahoo et al., 2021). Type X methanotrophs vary from Type I owing to minimal expression of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (an enzyme of serine cycle), occurring in Calvin-Benson-Bassham pathway (Park and Kim, 2019). There have been initiatives on methanol production via MMO (soluble and particulate) catalysed biological oxidation of methane (Mardina et al., 2016; However, MDH and other enzymes cause subsequent sequential oxidation of the produced methanol  into  intermediate  metabolites  and  CO2,  resulting  in  decreased extracellular methanol accumulation (Sheets et al., 2016). To that end, various  MDH  inhibitors  ( e.g. ,  NaCl,  NH4Cl,  phosphate,  EDTA,  and MgCl2) are supplemented in the fermentation media to increase methanol  production  (Patel  et  al.,  2016a;  Sheets  et  al.,  2016). Although, particulate MMOs are also involved in the methanol production metabolism, but they do not require any cofactors for their activity. On the other hand, soluble MMOs require natural co-factor (NADH) regeneration for their activity and increased methanol accumulation. However, the MDH inhibitor-induced inhibition of methanol oxidation result in NADH depletion (Sahoo et al., 2021). Therefore, formate is exogenously added as a source of NADH, which is necessary to maintain the activity of  soluble  MMO  in  presence  of  MDH  inhibitors  (during  soluble MMO-catalysed  methanol  production)  and  improved  methanol  titer",

Methanotrophs are Gram-negative proteobacteria that utilize methane as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth. Methane, bio-sequestered by methanotrophs, is catalytically oxidized into methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO), an endogenous irreversible enzyme. The produced methanol is subsequently converted into formaldehyde, formate, and CO2 via sequential oxidations catalysed by three reversible  enzymes:  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH),  formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, respectively (Sahoo et al., 2021). Soluble MMO causes faster methane oxidation relative to particulate MMO, owing to the higher substrate specificity of soluble MMO for methane (Sahoo et al., 2021). There have been initiatives on methanol production via MMO (soluble and particulate) catalysed biological oxidation of methane (Mardina et al., 2016; However, MDH and other enzymes cause subsequent sequential oxidation of the produced methanol  into  intermediate  metabolites  and  CO2,  resulting  in  decreased extracellular methanol accumulation (Sheets et al., 2016). To that end, various  MDH  inhibitors  ( e.g. ,  NaCl,  NH4Cl,  phosphate,  EDTA,  and MgCl2) are supplemented in the fermentation media to increase methanol  production  (Patel  et  al.,  2016a;  Sheets  et  al.,  2016). Although, particulate MMOs are also involved in the methanol production metabolism, but they do not require any cofactors for their activity. On the other hand, soluble MMOs require natural co-factor (NADH) regeneration for their activity and increased methanol accumulation. However, the MDH inhibitor-induced inhibition of methanol oxidation result in NADH depletion (Sahoo et al., 2021).

Mardina et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2016b; Patel et al., 2020a, b, c), etc. for methanol production using noxious C1-carbon compounds, like CH4  and CO2. Methane, bio-sequestered by methanotrophs, is catalytically oxidized into methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO), an endogenous irreversible enzyme. The produced methanol is subsequently converted into formaldehyde, formate, and CO2 via sequential oxidations catalysed by three reversible  enzymes:  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH),  formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, respectively (Sahoo et al., 2021). There have been initiatives on methanol production via MMO (soluble and particulate) catalysed biological oxidation of methane (Mardina et al., 2016; However, MDH and other enzymes cause subsequent sequential oxidation of the produced methanol  into  intermediate  metabolites  and  CO2,  resulting  in  decreased extracellular methanol accumulation (Sheets et al., 2016). To that end, various  MDH  inhibitors  ( e.g. ,  NaCl,  NH4Cl,  phosphate,  EDTA,  and MgCl2) are supplemented in the fermentation media to increase methanol  production  (Patel  et  al.,  2016a;  Sheets  et  al.,  2016). Although, particulate MMOs are also involved in the methanol production metabolism, but they do not require any cofactors for their activity. On the other hand, soluble MMOs require natural co-factor (NADH) regeneration for their activity and increased methanol accumulation. However, the MDH inhibitor-induced inhibition of methanol oxidation result in NADH depletion (Sahoo et al., 2021). Therefore, formate is exogenously added as a source of NADH, which is necessary to maintain the activity of  soluble  MMO  in  presence  of  MDH  inhibitors  (during  soluble MMO-catalysed  methanol  production)  and  improved  methanol  titer",

        "text_evidence": "Methane, bio-sequestered by methanotrophs, is catalytically oxidized into methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO), an endogenous irreversible enzyme. MMO is classified into two types: particulate MMO (integrated on the cell membrane), and soluble MMO (produced in the cytoplasm). Particulate MMO shows elevated expression at high copper to biomass ratios, while the expression of soluble MMO increases under low copper to biomass ratios and high titre of iron ions. Soluble MMO causes faster methane oxidation relative to particulate MMO, owing to the higher substrate specificity of soluble MMO for methane (Sahoo et al., 2021). Methanotrophs are broadly classified into three types on the basis of the type of MMO synthesized. Type I methanotrophs ( e.g. , species of Methylosoma , Methylothermus , Methylosarcina , Methylosphaera , Methylohalobius , Methylomonas , Methylobacter , Methylomicrobium , Crenothrix and Clonothrix ) express particulate MMO; Type II methanotrophs ( e.g. , species  of Methylocapsa , Methylocella , Methylosinus and Methylocystis ) express both soluble and particulate MMO; and Type X methanotrophs ( e.g. , species of Methylococcus and Methylocaldum ) express certain specific properties of both Type I and Type II methanotrophs (Sahoo et al., 2021). There have been initiatives on methanol production via MMO (soluble and particulate) catalysed biological oxidation of methane (Mardina et al., 2016; Although, particulate MMOs are also involved in the methanol production metabolism, but they do not require any cofactors for their activity. On the other hand, soluble MMOs require natural co-factor (NADH) regeneration for their activity and increased methanol accumulation. Therefore, formate is exogenously added as a source of NADH, which is necessary to maintain the activity of  soluble  MMO  in  presence  of  MDH  inhibitors  (during  soluble MMO-catalysed  methanol  production)  and  improved  methanol  titer",

Low biomass titer at 5% (0.4 g L GLYPH<0> 1 ) and 10% (0.67 g L GLYPH<0> 1 ) methane concentrations may be attributed to the substrate  limitation,  as  is  evident  from  the  complete  utilization  of methane from headspace within 48 h of cultivation (Fig. 2b).

However, a reduction in biomass titer at higher methane concentrations of 20% -80% may be attributed to the combinatorial effect of inadequate availability of methane in the liquid phase due to poor mass transfer and decreased concentration of oxygen in the reactor causing interference in the aerobic metabolism of the organism.",

However, methanol titer was found to reduce significantly (0.15 -0.18 g L GLYPH<0> 1 ) when either freshly  prepared  NMS  medium  or  same  NMS  medium  (used  for  the growth) was employed for methanol synthesis. Phosphate buffer also resulted  in  improved  methanol  productivity  (0.026  g  L GLYPH<0> 1 h GLYPH<0> 1 ) One  of  the  key  problems  with  methanol  production  from methane is the subsequent conversion of methanol into formaldehyde, catalysed by the enzyme methanol dehydrogenase (Sahoo et al., 2021). Several authors have reported the role of phosphate as an inhibitor for the enzyme methanol dehydrogenase, either by adding a specific concentration of phosphate to the NMS media (Han et al., 2013; Sheets et al., 2016) or by directly using phosphate buffer as a medium (Mardina et  al.,  2016; Patel  et al.,  2016a, 2020c) for methanol production via methane oxidation. Although in our study, methanol is being produced through the CO2  reduction pathway, there may be a possibility of the back-conversion of methanol into intermediate metabolites and CO2, owing to the reversible nature of the enzymes methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. This is where the  role  of  phosphate  buffer  as  a  cultivation  medium  for  methanol production from CO2 comes into play, resulting in higher methanol titer and productivity relative to the NMS media. It is important to note that in  none  of  the  media,  further  growth  of  the  organism  was  observed during methanol synthesis stage or phase (data not shown). In general, methanotrophic cells stay in the resting phase while being used as biocatalyst for methanol production from CO2 (Xin et al., 2007) and hence do not require other media components to sustain their growth. Intracellularly stored NADH supply the reducing energy to accomplish the reduction of CO2 to methanol. In second stage, these reducing equivalents (in presence of excess CO2) drive the equilibrium in backward direction causing the conversion of CO2 into methanol (Xin et al., 2007). Therefore, phosphate buffer serves as the low-cost medium for methanol biosynthesis without any additional nutrient requirement.",

The results  suggest  that  headspace  volume  is  another  process  parameter influencing methanol production since it is directly linked to the availability of CO2, as the substrate for reduction reaction, at a fixed partial pressure. Thus, the occurrence of the highest methanol titer at liquid to headspace volume ratio of 10:90 could be attributed to the absence of substrate limitation (Pen et al., 2014). The  biomass  density  remained almost constant during methanol production stage under varying CO2 concentrations in the headspace and different liquid to headspace volume ratios (Fig.",

        "text_evidence": "These results point towards the role of CO2 partial pressure in the headspace as a critical parameter for methanol induction. With the increase in liquid to headspace volume ratio from 50:50, methanol titer increased linearly and a maximum titer of 0.58 g L GLYPH<0> 1 (18.10 mM) was obtained at a ratio of 10:90 (Fig. 4c). The results  suggest  that  headspace  volume  is  another  process  parameter influencing methanol production since it is directly linked to the availability of CO2, as the substrate for reduction reaction, at a fixed partial pressure. Thus, the occurrence of the highest methanol titer at liquid to headspace volume ratio of 10:90 could be attributed to the absence of substrate limitation (Pen et al., 2014). Characterization of M. sporium towards  methanol  biosynthesis  through  methane  oxidation  under different  headspace  volumes  resulted  in  highest  titer  of  5.40  mM  at headspace volume of 83.33% (Patel et al., 2016a). Pen et al. (2014) reported  an  improved  methanol  titer  of  290  mg  L GLYPH<0> 1 from  methane biohydroxylation  using M.  trichosporium in  batch  reactor  with  90% headspace volume as compared to cultivation with 37.5% headspace volume (35 mg L GLYPH<0> 1 ). The  biomass  density  remained almost constant during methanol production stage under varying CO2 concentrations in the headspace and different liquid to headspace volume ratios (Fig.",

Hence, in the present study, failure to induce methanol production in semi-batch stirred tank reactor may be attributed to the lower partial pressure of CO2 in the gas mixture, which is  considered  to  be  the  critical  parameter  for  methanol  production. Therefore, the second stage of methanol production was carried out in air-tight  batch  reactor  with  CO2 mixed  with  air  supplied  in  the headspace. The extent of methanol formation was carried out under varying CO2 concentrations  in  the  headspace  ranging  from  10%  to  70%  v/v.  No methanol was produced at the lowest CO2  concentration of 10%. The methanol titer was found to increase concomitantly with the increase in CO2 concentration from 30% and reached a maximum value of 0.57 g L GLYPH<0> 1 (17.79 mM) at a CO2 concentration of 50% (Fig. 4b). The CO2 fixation percentage at 50% CO2 concentration was estimated to be 8.95% of the initial amount of CO2 present in the headspace. However, further increase  in  CO2 concentration  beyond  50%  resulted  in  a  marginal decrease in methanol titer. These results point towards the role of CO2 partial pressure in the headspace as a critical parameter for methanol induction. However, down regulation of methanol biosynthesis at higher CO2 partial pressure may be attributed to the possible inhibitory effect on enzymatic activity, electron transport chain, and carbon metabolism (Ceron-Chafla et al., 2020). There are a handful of studies towards the biological production of methanol via CO2 reduction pathway. Methylosinus sporium was reported to produce methanol with a very low titer of 0.33 mM when grown in the presence of 30% CO2 (Patel et al., 2016b). Xin et al. (2007) reported production of 0.004 \u03bc mol methanol per mg dry cell weight from Methylosinus trichosporium cells, using 55.5% CO2 in the headspace. The corresponding CO2 fixation percentage was estimated to be 9.06%. The results  suggest  that  headspace  volume  is  another  process  parameter influencing methanol production since it is directly linked to the availability of CO2, as the substrate for reduction reaction, at a fixed partial pressure. The  biomass  density  remained almost constant during methanol production stage under varying CO2 concentrations in the headspace and different liquid to headspace volume ratios (Fig. Further, methanol production from biological reduction of CO2, is also limited to a low methanol titer of up to 0.33 mM (Xin et al., 2007;",

The results  suggest  that  headspace  volume  is  another  process  parameter influencing methanol production since it is directly linked to the availability of CO2, as the substrate for reduction reaction, at a fixed partial pressure. Thus, the occurrence of the highest methanol titer at liquid to headspace volume ratio of 10:90 could be attributed to the absence of substrate limitation (Pen et al., 2014). Characterization of M. sporium towards  methanol  biosynthesis  through  methane  oxidation  under different  headspace  volumes  resulted  in  highest  titer  of  5.40  mM  at headspace volume of 83.33% (Patel et al., 2016a). Pen et al. (2014) reported  an  improved  methanol  titer  of  290  mg  L GLYPH<0> 1 from  methane biohydroxylation  using M.  trichosporium in  batch  reactor  with  90% headspace volume as compared to cultivation with 37.5% headspace volume (35 mg L GLYPH<0> 1 ). The  biomass  density  remained almost constant during methanol production stage under varying CO2 concentrations in the headspace and different liquid to headspace volume ratios (Fig. As  discussed  earlier,  authors  have  reported  several  strategies  to overcome  the  limitations  associated  with  methanol  production  from biological oxidation of CH4, including, use of biogas as feedstock, cell\n\nModel parameters for two-stage integrated process towards production of bioof methane and carbon dioxide. Despite of these approaches, the reported methanol titre is limited to the range of 5.37 -13.42 mM (or, 0.17 -0.43 g L GLYPH<0> 1 ). Further, methanol production from biological reduction of CO2, is also limited to a low methanol titer of up to 0.33 mM (Xin et al., 2007; Therefore, it can be concluded that the maximum methanol titer achieved in the present study under optimum conditions is significantly higher than the similar studies reported in literature.",
