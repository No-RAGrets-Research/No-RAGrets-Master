The use of a flow reactor enabled higher quantities of oxidant to be employed for lipase-mediated oxidation of alkenes over prolonged periods of time without deactivation of the biocatalyst Very short reaction times for acrylamide synthesis in microreactors also greatly weakened the inhibition of Rhodococcus ruber cells by acrylonitrile and acrylamide. Another critical parameter for enzyme-catalyzed reactions is leaching of enzymes from solid beads, contaminating products and reducing biocatalyst (immobilized enzyme) lifetime.",

Biocatalytic processes in microfluidic systems encompass a broad range of materials and systems, ranging from simple capillaries and tubing to custom-made microchannels, monoliths, and microstructured reactors with inserted nanomaterial (Table 2). Enzymatic microreactors can be classified with respect to shape, materials used, and interface preparation or with respect to flow characteristics. Y-shaped, C -shaped, Tshaped, X-shaped, or tapered are the most common microchannel shapes, made mainly from glass, silicon, ceramic, stainless steel, or polymer materials.

            "text_evidence": "Many biocatalytic processes at the microreactor scale have been theoretically described using validated mathematical models on the macroscopic level. Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).

            "text_evidence": "Many biocatalytic processes at the microreactor scale have been theoretically described using validated mathematical models on the macroscopic level. Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).

            "text_evidence": "Many biocatalytic processes at the microreactor scale have been theoretically described using validated mathematical models on the macroscopic level. Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).

            "text_evidence": "Many biocatalytic processes at the microreactor scale have been theoretically described using validated mathematical models on the macroscopic level. Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).

However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes.

Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale.

Development of a microfluidic platform for directed evolution, using water-in-oil-droplet compartments for screening [37], plays a significant role in faster process development, while multi-inlet microfluidic reactors for controlled addition of inhibitory/toxic substrates The further expansion of microreactors into process development will proceed from established analytical platforms using both continuous and droplet assays. Reductions in development time and cost can be achieved by activity-based reaction screening as a function of pH, temperature, reaction conditions, and substrate scope or by end point determinations. The further development of more precise reaction control in microreactors by suppressed formation of undesired products or byproducts, as well as in situ preparation of reactive species only when they are needed, will enable telescoped flow synthesis from simple precursors [87]. The current rapid progress in continuous-flow manufacturing and innovative approaches for overcoming engineering and molecular bottlenecks opens a wealth of exciting new opportunities and process windows for future discovery, development, and production.",

The use of a flow reactor enabled higher quantities of oxidant to be employed for lipase-mediated oxidation of alkenes over prolonged periods of time without deactivation of the biocatalyst Very short reaction times for acrylamide synthesis in microreactors also greatly weakened the inhibition of Rhodococcus ruber cells by acrylonitrile and acrylamide.

        "text_evidence": "Many biocatalytic processes at the microreactor scale have been theoretically described using validated mathematical models on the macroscopic level. Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).

        "text_evidence": "Many biocatalytic processes at the microreactor scale have been theoretically described using validated mathematical models on the macroscopic level. Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).

The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).

Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).

Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties.

        "text_evidence": "Many biocatalytic processes at the microreactor scale have been theoretically described using validated mathematical models on the macroscopic level. Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).
