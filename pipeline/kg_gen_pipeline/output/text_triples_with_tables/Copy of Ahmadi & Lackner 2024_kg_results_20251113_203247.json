Methanotrophs can  catalyze  the  oxidation  of  methane  to  methanol  by using methane monooxygenases (MMOs) enzyme (Rhee et\u00a0 al.  2019;  Lackner et\u00a0al. 2022). It is well known that the  aerobic  methanotrophs  are  Gram-negative  bacteria and  with  a  total  of  23  genera  and  roughly  60  species being identified (Guerrero-Cruz et\u00a0al. 2021; Wang et\u00a0al. 2023a). There are different types of aerobic methanotrophs known as Gammaproteobacteria, type I,  with  families Methylococcaceae and Methylothermaceae ,   and Alphaproteobacteria, type II, with families Methylocystaceae and Beijerinckiaceae (Guerrero-Cruz et\u00a0al. 2021). The anaerobic methanotrophs were found in the marine sediments for the first time where sulfate is present and is involved in methane consumption (Kalyuzhnaya et\u00a0al. 2019). Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are responsible for sulfatedependent anaerobic methane oxidation process in anaerobic conditions (Yu et\u00a0al. 2022) (Fig.\u00a02). 2-\n\nHS -\n\nCH4\n\nCO2\n\nAQDS\n\nS0\n\nHS2 -\n\nSO4 2-\n\nSO4 2-\n\nAQH 2DS\n\nHS -\n\nAQDS\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\ninvolve in microbial processes of methane oxidation (Malyan et\u00a0al. 2021). Our research findings align with the extracellular electron transfer concept depicted in scenario A ,  rather than the active sulfate respiration and sulfur disproportionation model shown in scenario B (Yu et\u00a0al. 2022)\n\ninvolved in anaerobic methane oxidation processes (Siniscalchi et\u00a0al. 2022): Several documents demonstrated the effective role of nitrate/nitrite reduction in methane oxidation that is critical to processes of GHG emission (Baba and Miyaji 2020; Farhan Ul Haque et\u00a0al. 2020; Hwang and Lee 2023).

Methanotrophic organisms with formally recognized names are classified into two distinct classes, namely, the Gammaproteobacteria (also referred to as type I and type X) and Alphaproteobacteria (also referred to as type II) classes (Mu\u00f1oz-G\u00f3mez et\u00a0al. 2022). Gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs are categorized within the Methylococcales order\n\nOuter membrane reductase),  MER  (methylene  H4MPT reductase),  MTD (methyleneH4MPT dehydrogenase), MTR (methyl-H4MPT:coenzyme M methyltransferase), NAR  (nitrate reductase), and NRF (nitrite reductase  ammonium-forming). Category I methanotrophs have been classified into three distinct groups. Type II methanotrophs pertain to the Alphaproteobacteria class and encompass representatives from the Methylocystaceae and Beijerinckiaceae families. Within the type II methanotrophs, there are closely affiliated clusters present in the validated species within the Methylocystis and\n\nMethylosinus genera. Specific characteristics that differentiate the genera of type II methanotrophs are outlined in Table\u00a04. On the other hand, type I methanotrophs are categorized as the 'high capacity' group, primarily inhabiting environments abundant in methane but lacking in oxygen. Conversely, the 'low capacity' type II methanotrophs prevail in environments with scant methane and ample oxygen. This distinction implies that varying types of methanotrophs\n\nmay partake in methane oxidation under diverse moisture conditions, as highlighted by Zhou et\u00a0al. (2020).",

While Methylocella spp. If Methylocella demonstrates reduced susceptibility to the adverse effects of propylene epoxide, it could potentially have an advantage over M. capsulatus in the production of this compound.

            "text_evidence": "Methanotrophs, found widespread, offer potential for remediating contaminated sites. However, the available data suggests that despite its slower degradation rate, the particulate\n\nMMO (pMMO) ultimately proves to be the more efficient system. Within these strains, the pMMO is activated in the presence of acetate or ethanol, as observed in studies by Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. (2022). Such a strategy would be more feasible to implement in polluted sites compared to methane introduction and would additionally prevent competition for binding to the monooxygenase enzyme. As another example of bioremediation, Methylocella was among the bacteria associated with degradation of plastics in landfill lysimeters (Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. 2022). These microorganisms possess a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle but lack the enzymes associated with the Calvin-Benson cycle. Additionally, they engage in nitrogen fixation through an aerotolerant nitrogenase system. The prominent phospholipid fatty acid is 18:1v8c, and their DNA base compositions exhibit a range of 62 to 67 mol% G1C (Whiddon et\u00a0al. 2019; Le et\u00a0al. 2021)\n\ngrow relatively quickly and to high cell densities, have been exploited for production of single-cell protein (Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. 2022). While Methylocella , which exhibits slower grow, may not be as useful to produce low value, bulk chemicals, it can still be grown to high cell densities in fermenter culture (Priyadarsini et\u00a0al. 2023). Its metabolic versatility warrants further examination in this respect. Large-scale production of methanol from methane is an attractive proposition and promising results have been obtained in several studies (Baba and Miyaji 2020). As an illustration, combinations of Methylomonas methanica and Methylocella tundra co-cultures, which were encapsulated within silica gel, were supplied with simulated biogas as a nutrient source. It  is  worth  noting  that  the  introduction  of  hydrogen resulted in a significant enhancement in methanol production, nearly doubling it to approximately 0.32 g   l -1 , with a corresponding 66% conversion efficiency (Zhou et\u00a0al. 2020). However, a notable challenge in utilizing the MMO for methanol production lies in the need for a costly electron donor, such as formate, to facilitate methane oxidation. Nonetheless, a promising solution may be found in facultative methanotrophs, as they possess the capability to utilize compounds like acetate, which are commonly found in waste streams, as an alternative electron donor (Lee et\u00a0al. 2023). exhibit a wider array of metabolic capabilities compared to obligatory methanotrophs, their potential biocatalytic applications have not been fully explored. The soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) has traditionally been recognized as an exceptionally versatile biocatalyst, facilitating the oxidation of a diverse spectrum of compounds, including alkanes, alkenes, and even relatively large aromatics like naphthalene (Priyadarsini et\u00a0al. 2023). However, the toxicity associated with this metabolite necessitates the implementation of a recycling system to regenerate the entire-cell biocatalyst (Samanta and Sani 2023). If Methylocella demonstrates reduced susceptibility to the adverse effects of propylene epoxide, it could potentially have an advantage over M. capsulatus in the production of this compound. This advantage stems from Methylocella ability to harness alternative energy sources for facilitating the oxidation of propylene through the sMMO enzyme.",

            "text_evidence": "The majority of the necessary reducing potential required for methane metabolism is generated through a series of steps involving the oxidation of formaldehyde, progressing through formate, and ultimately leading to the production of carbon dioxide. Within methylotrophs, there are multiple enzyme systems responsible for the oxidation of formaldehyde to formate (Rozova et\u00a0al. 2021). The conversion of formate to carbon dioxide is facilitated by an NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase in most, if not all, methanotrophs (Schmitz et\u00a0al. 2022). Some methylotrophs that employ the RuMP pathway for formaldehyde assimilation utilize a cyclic pathway for  the  oxidation  of  formaldehyde  to  carbon  dioxide (Cruz and Pijuan 2022). In this pathway, formaldehyde and ribulose-5-phosphate engage in a reaction, yielding hexulose-6-phosphate, which is subsequently isomerized to  fructose-6-phosphate, eventually transforming into glucose-6-phosphate. As the cycle progresses, 6-phosphogluconate is oxidized to generate both carbon dioxide and ribulose-6-phosphate, effectively concluding the cyclic pathway responsible for formaldehyde oxidation. While most obligatory methanotrophs utilize the linear pathway for formaldehyde oxidation, many non-methane utilizing methylotrophs predominantly employ the cyclic pathway (Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. 2022).",

A noteworthy case lies with the type II methanotroph, Methylocella silvestris , which exhibits the capability to utilize both methane and propane as sources of carbon and energy. In addition to ethane assimilation, propane assimilation pathways have also been observed in M. silvestris (Bordel et\u00a0al. 2019) and Methylacidiphilum sp. Two additional pathways are involved in the degradation of propane: the first converts propane into 1-propanol and then methylmalonyl -CoA, whereas the second converts propane into 2-propanol, which is subsequently oxidized to acetone, acetol, and lactate, which can be further converted into pyruvate by putative lactate dehydrogenase (Fig.\u00a05) (Le and Lee 2023). While  cultivating M.  silvestris on  propane,  it  was observed that both 2-propanol and acetone accumulated in the culture medium.

Additionally, a relatively small cavity in the active site restricts the substrate specificity of pMMO and leads to preferential oxidation of the substrate (R)-alcohols (Pham et\u00a0al. 2023). Notably, this cluster encompasses one of the three genomic operons related to pmoA, which generates pMMO. This approach could potentially amplify carbon flux directed towards the biosynthesis pathway of desired products within methanotrophic bacteria.",

To establish a synthetic glycerol-utilizing pathway, three enzymes from E. coli including glycerol transporter ( glpF ), membrane-binding   FAD + dependent glycerol-3 phosphate\n\nvarious compounds such as Xu5P (xylulose 5-phosphate), Ru5P (ribulose-5-phosphate),  S7P  (sedoheptulose-7-phosphate),  G3P  (glyceraldehyde  3-phosphate),  E4P  (erythrose  4-phosphate),  F6P  (fructose 6  phosphate),  H6P  (3-hexulose-6-phosphate),  R5P  (ribose  5-phosphate), HP (hydroxypyruvate), DHAP (dihydroxyacetone phosphate), MDH (methanol dehydrogenase), and ADH (alcohol dehydrogenase) (Le and Lee 2023)\n\nTCA\n\ndehydrogenase ( glpD ), glycerol kinase ( glpK ), and soluble   NAD + dependent glycerol-3 phosphate dehydrogenase ( gpsA ) from M. alcaliphilum 20Z were overexpressed (Le et\u00a0al. 2021). Glycerol undergoes a two-step conversion into DHAP (dihydroxyacetone  phosphate),  subsequently  entering the metabolic network (Rozova et\u00a0al. 2021). Through the overexpression of these four genes, noticeable cell growth was observed on glycerol alone, resulting in a final OD600 (optical density at 600 nm) of 1.4 when using 0.1% (v/v) glycerol. However, the genetically engineered strain encountered growth challenges in the presence of higher glycerol concentrations, specifically 0.5% (v/v) and 1% (v/v) (Tyne et\u00a0al. 2023). This was attributed to the hypothesis that elevated glycerol concentrations might significantly influence osmotic potential, consequently hindering growth (Pham et\u00a0al. 2023).",

To enable stable xylose utilization in Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z, genetic engineering efforts involved chromosomally integrating the xylA and xylB genes from E. coli , along with the rpe gene from M. alcaliphilum 20Z, under the control of the Ptac promoter. This engineering effort resulted in the development of a strain capable of efficiently utilizing xylose as its sole carbon source, as evidenced by observable growth under these conditions.",

Moreover, genome analysis has revealed that some type I methanotrophs may harbor putative gluconate kinase ( GntK ) and glucose-1-dehydrogenase ( gdh ) enzymes, the functions of which remain currently unknown (Rozova et\u00a0al. 2021). Double mutants ( gdh\u2500/glk\u2500) or ( gntk\u2500/glk\u2500) exhibited distinct phenotypes compared to the wild-type strain of Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum when grown on methane. An intriguing observation is the absence of a phosphotransferase system for glucose transport in type I methanotrophs, which may hinder the uptake of glucose from the surrounding medium into the cells. Remarkably, Pham et\u00a0al. (2023) demonstrated the engineered growth of Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z on glucose through the overexpression of three target genes: glucose-facilitated diffusion protein ( glf ) from Zymomonas mobilis ,  native  glucokinase  ( glk ),  and  phosphoglucose isomerase ( pgi )  from E. coli . Subsequently, glucose is converted into glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate through the actions of glucokinase ( glk ) and phosphoglucose isomerase ( pgi ), respectively.",

Both gluconate kinase and glucose dehydrogenase could potentially have associations with the EntnerDoudoroff pathway, glycolysis, and the oxidative PPP (Tyne et\u00a0al. 2023). These mutants displayed higher accumulations of glucose-trehalose and lower glycogen storage (Rozova et\u00a0al. 2021). Despite the presence of redundant sugar metabolism pathways in obligate methanotrophs, the precise reasons for their inability to utilize glucose as a carbon and energy source for growth remain unclear.

The genes encoding pMMO from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) have been cloned and sequenced (Dawson et\u00a0al. 2023) and are clustered on the chromosome in the order pmoCAB (Fig.\u00a07B). There are two virtually identical copies of these genes (13 bp changes over 3183 bp of pmoCAB ) present in the genome of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and a third copy of pmoC has also been identified (Bo et\u00a0al. 2023). The presence of multiple copies of these genes in such bacteria raises\n\nSingh et\u00a0al. (2023) successfully developed chromosomal insertion mutants in all seven pmo genes found in Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Specifically, the mutants related to the first copy demonstrated approximately two-thirds of the methane oxidation activity seen in the wildtype strain, while the mutants related to the second copy exhibited roughly one-third of the activity observed in the wild-type strain.",

The genes encoding pMMO from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) have been cloned and sequenced (Dawson et\u00a0al. 2023) and are clustered on the chromosome in the order pmoCAB (Fig.\u00a07B). There are two virtually identical copies of these genes (13 bp changes over 3183 bp of pmoCAB ) present in the genome of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and a third copy of pmoC has also been identified (Bo et\u00a0al. 2023).

Methanotrophs can  catalyze  the  oxidation  of  methane  to  methanol  by using methane monooxygenases (MMOs) enzyme (Rhee et\u00a0 al.  2019;  Lackner et\u00a0al. 2022). It is well known that the  aerobic  methanotrophs  are  Gram-negative  bacteria and  with  a  total  of  23  genera  and  roughly  60  species being identified (Guerrero-Cruz et\u00a0al. 2021; Wang et\u00a0al. 2023a). There are different types of aerobic methanotrophs known as Gammaproteobacteria, type I,  with  families Methylococcaceae and Methylothermaceae ,   and Alphaproteobacteria, type II, with families Methylocystaceae and Beijerinckiaceae (Guerrero-Cruz et\u00a0al. 2021). The anaerobic methanotrophs were found in the marine sediments for the first time where sulfate is present and is involved in methane consumption (Kalyuzhnaya et\u00a0al. 2019). Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are responsible for sulfatedependent anaerobic methane oxidation process in anaerobic conditions (Yu et\u00a0al. 2022) (Fig.\u00a02). 2-\n\nHS -\n\nCH4\n\nCO2\n\nAQDS\n\nS0\n\nHS2 -\n\nSO4 2-\n\nSO4 2-\n\nAQH 2DS\n\nHS -\n\nAQDS\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\ninvolve in microbial processes of methane oxidation (Malyan et\u00a0al. 2021). Our research findings align with the extracellular electron transfer concept depicted in scenario A ,  rather than the active sulfate respiration and sulfur disproportionation model shown in scenario B (Yu et\u00a0al. 2022)\n\ninvolved in anaerobic methane oxidation processes (Siniscalchi et\u00a0al. 2022): Several documents demonstrated the effective role of nitrate/nitrite reduction in methane oxidation that is critical to processes of GHG emission (Baba and Miyaji 2020; Farhan Ul Haque et\u00a0al. 2020; Hwang and Lee 2023).

Methanotrophic organisms with formally recognized names are classified into two distinct classes, namely, the Gammaproteobacteria (also referred to as type I and type X) and Alphaproteobacteria (also referred to as type II) classes (Mu\u00f1oz-G\u00f3mez et\u00a0al. 2022). Gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs are categorized within the Methylococcales order\n\nOuter membrane reductase),  MER  (methylene  H4MPT reductase),  MTD (methyleneH4MPT dehydrogenase), MTR (methyl-H4MPT:coenzyme M methyltransferase), NAR  (nitrate reductase), and NRF (nitrite reductase  ammonium-forming). Category I methanotrophs have been classified into three distinct groups. Type II methanotrophs pertain to the Alphaproteobacteria class and encompass representatives from the Methylocystaceae and Beijerinckiaceae families. Within the type II methanotrophs, there are closely affiliated clusters present in the validated species within the Methylocystis and\n\nMethylosinus genera. Specific characteristics that differentiate the genera of type II methanotrophs are outlined in Table\u00a04. On the other hand, type I methanotrophs are categorized as the 'high capacity' group, primarily inhabiting environments abundant in methane but lacking in oxygen. Conversely, the 'low capacity' type II methanotrophs prevail in environments with scant methane and ample oxygen. This distinction implies that varying types of methanotrophs\n\nmay partake in methane oxidation under diverse moisture conditions, as highlighted by Zhou et\u00a0al. (2020).",

        "text_evidence": "Methanotrophs, found widespread, offer potential for remediating contaminated sites. However, the available data suggests that despite its slower degradation rate, the particulate\n\nMMO (pMMO) ultimately proves to be the more efficient system. Within these strains, the pMMO is activated in the presence of acetate or ethanol, as observed in studies by Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. (2022). Such a strategy would be more feasible to implement in polluted sites compared to methane introduction and would additionally prevent competition for binding to the monooxygenase enzyme. As another example of bioremediation, Methylocella was among the bacteria associated with degradation of plastics in landfill lysimeters (Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. 2022). These microorganisms possess a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle but lack the enzymes associated with the Calvin-Benson cycle. Additionally, they engage in nitrogen fixation through an aerotolerant nitrogenase system. The prominent phospholipid fatty acid is 18:1v8c, and their DNA base compositions exhibit a range of 62 to 67 mol% G1C (Whiddon et\u00a0al. 2019; Le et\u00a0al. 2021)\n\ngrow relatively quickly and to high cell densities, have been exploited for production of single-cell protein (Khanongnuch et\u00a0al. 2022). While Methylocella , which exhibits slower grow, may not be as useful to produce low value, bulk chemicals, it can still be grown to high cell densities in fermenter culture (Priyadarsini et\u00a0al. 2023). Its metabolic versatility warrants further examination in this respect. Large-scale production of methanol from methane is an attractive proposition and promising results have been obtained in several studies (Baba and Miyaji 2020). As an illustration, combinations of Methylomonas methanica and Methylocella tundra co-cultures, which were encapsulated within silica gel, were supplied with simulated biogas as a nutrient source. It  is  worth  noting  that  the  introduction  of  hydrogen resulted in a significant enhancement in methanol production, nearly doubling it to approximately 0.32 g   l -1 , with a corresponding 66% conversion efficiency (Zhou et\u00a0al. 2020). However, a notable challenge in utilizing the MMO for methanol production lies in the need for a costly electron donor, such as formate, to facilitate methane oxidation. Nonetheless, a promising solution may be found in facultative methanotrophs, as they possess the capability to utilize compounds like acetate, which are commonly found in waste streams, as an alternative electron donor (Lee et\u00a0al. 2023). exhibit a wider array of metabolic capabilities compared to obligatory methanotrophs, their potential biocatalytic applications have not been fully explored. The soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) has traditionally been recognized as an exceptionally versatile biocatalyst, facilitating the oxidation of a diverse spectrum of compounds, including alkanes, alkenes, and even relatively large aromatics like naphthalene (Priyadarsini et\u00a0al. 2023). However, the toxicity associated with this metabolite necessitates the implementation of a recycling system to regenerate the entire-cell biocatalyst (Samanta and Sani 2023). If Methylocella demonstrates reduced susceptibility to the adverse effects of propylene epoxide, it could potentially have an advantage over M. capsulatus in the production of this compound. This advantage stems from Methylocella ability to harness alternative energy sources for facilitating the oxidation of propylene through the sMMO enzyme.",

MDH exists as an \u03b1 2 \u03b22 tetramer, composed of large (60 to 67 kDa) and small (8.5 kDa) subunits (Le and Lee 2022). This enzyme is classified as a quinoprotein, with each tetramer containing 2 moles of pyrroloquinoline quinone and 1 mole of calcium (Zhu et\u00a0al. 2022). The transfer of electrons from MDH to cytochrome c L , an atypical cytochrome serving as the specific electron acceptor for MDH, is the subsequent step (Tikhonova et\u00a0al. 2023). Importantly, all three components-MDH, cytochrome c L , and cytochrome c H -are soluble and reside within the periplasm of gramnegative methylotrophs (Tentori et\u00a0al. 2022). In contrast, gram-positive methylotrophs employ an NAD-linked MDH for methanol oxidation, while methanol-oxidizing yeast species use a methanol oxidase system for the same purpose. The regulation of MDH (malate dehydrogenase) synthesis involves complex regulatory networks in facultative methylotrophs and is at least present in one methanotrophic organism. A comprehensive understanding of the control mechanisms governing MDH synthesis has been extensively explored in previous literature (Howe et\u00a0al. 2023; Venetz et\u00a0al. 2022).\n\n371 studies\n\n12503 sequence reads",

In contrast to the comprehensive exploration of methane (C1) metabolism, the breakdown of gaseous alkanes ranging from C2 to C5 among methanotrophs has received limited attention (as depicted in Fig.\u00a05). A noteworthy case lies with the type II methanotroph, Methylocella silvestris , which exhibits the capability to utilize both methane and propane as sources of carbon and energy. This distinct trait marks M. silvestris as the initial methanotroph known to utilize a short-chain alkane instead of methane. Furthermore, M. silvestris is equipped to metabolize ethane through oxidation processes. The presence of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase explains its ability to thrive on ethane and its metabolic intermediates ethanol and acetate (Bordel et\u00a0al. 2019). In addition to ethane assimilation, propane assimilation pathways have also been observed in M. silvestris (Bordel et\u00a0al. 2019) and Methylacidiphilum sp.",

However, the genetically engineered strain encountered growth challenges in the presence of higher glycerol concentrations, specifically 0.5% (v/v) and 1% (v/v) (Tyne et\u00a0al. 2023). This was attributed to the hypothesis that elevated glycerol concentrations might significantly influence osmotic potential, consequently hindering growth (Pham et\u00a0al. 2023).",
