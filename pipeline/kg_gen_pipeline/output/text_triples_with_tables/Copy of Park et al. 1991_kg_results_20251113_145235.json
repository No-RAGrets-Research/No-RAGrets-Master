Cell  growth  was  inhibited progressively  by  phosphate  concentrations  above 40 mM. This is similar to previous results obtained by Harwood  and  Pirt13 with M. capsulatus (Bath),  although the phosphate concentration which is required\n\n-\n\n1 2\n\nI\n\n0\n\n-\n\nE\n\n1 0 -\n\n0 8 -\n\ncn\n\n5\n\n0 6 -\n\nn\n\n0\n\n04-\n\n8\n\n0\n\n.-\n\n0\n\n.- c\n\n-\n\ng\n\n0 2 -\n\n0 -\n\nPhosphate\n\n(mM) A high phosphate level is known to inhibit whole-cell methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) activity and to result in the accumulation of  methanol in the culture medium.\" But it is not clear why M. trichosporium OB3b can  tolerate  more highly elevated phosphate concentrations than M. capsulatus (Bath). Both  the  propene  and  the  chloroform oxidative MMO  activities in  Figure 3  are  seen  to be constant  up  to  80  mM phosphate,  irrespective of  the decreasing trend  in  specific growth  rate. At  approximately 90-100 mM phosphate,  however, a  sharp increase in MMO propene activity was observed, yielding an absolute specific activity of 220 nmol/mg dry cell wt min.  This  higher propene  oxidative activity is due to the production of  pMMO, not  an elevated production of  sMMO, because cells grown on 100 mM or higher phosphate  do  not  display  any  detectable activity with chloroform (Fig. 3). This observation raised  an interesting question concerning the role of  phosphate in regulating the form of MMO, namely whether the shift in enzyme location is due to a high phosphate concentration per se or due to Cu contaminants  present  in  the  Na/K  salts  that  are used  in  preparing  high  phosphate  culture  medium. With 100 mM phosphate, it was observed that propene oxidative activity was high (ca. 200 nmol/mg  dry  cell  wt  min)  at  a  low  cell  density (A 6 6 0 = 0.28), but it declined to 95 nmol/mg dry cell wt min when the A6 6 0 reached 0.6. 0.2 p M for 100 mM phosphate medium compared to only 0.02 p M for 10 mM phosphate medium. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that  the production of  pMMO in Figure 3 at high phosphate concentrations is due to traces of  carry-over Cu contamination in the Na/K salts.",

Both  the  propene  and  the  chloroform oxidative MMO  activities in  Figure 3  are  seen  to be constant  up  to  80  mM phosphate,  irrespective of  the decreasing trend  in  specific growth  rate. At  approximately 90-100 mM phosphate,  however, a  sharp increase in MMO propene activity was observed, yielding an absolute specific activity of 220 nmol/mg dry cell wt min.  This  higher propene  oxidative activity is due to the production of  pMMO, not  an elevated production of  sMMO, because cells grown on 100 mM or higher phosphate  do  not  display  any  detectable activity with chloroform (Fig. 3). This observation raised  an interesting question concerning the role of  phosphate in regulating the form of MMO, namely whether the shift in enzyme location is due to a high phosphate concentration per se or due to Cu contaminants  present  in  the  Na/K  salts  that  are used  in  preparing  high  phosphate  culture  medium. With 100 mM phosphate, it was observed that propene oxidative activity was high (ca. 200 nmol/mg  dry  cell  wt  min)  at  a  low  cell  density (A 6 6 0 = 0.28), but it declined to 95 nmol/mg dry cell wt min when the A6 6 0 reached 0.6. 0.2 p M for 100 mM phosphate medium compared to only 0.02 p M for 10 mM phosphate medium. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that  the production of  pMMO in Figure 3 at high phosphate concentrations is due to traces of  carry-over Cu contamination in the Na/K salts.",

            "text_evidence": "/r nl Figure 3 shows the effects of  the culture medium phosphate  concentration  at  pH  7.0  on  cell  growth  and whole-cell  MMO  activity. Cell  growth  was  inhibited progressively  by  phosphate  concentrations  above 40 mM. This is similar to previous results obtained by Harwood  and  Pirt13 with M. capsulatus (Bath),  although the phosphate concentration which is required\n\n-\n\n1 2\n\nI\n\n0\n\n-\n\nE\n\n1 0 -\n\n0 8 -\n\ncn\n\n5\n\n0 6 -\n\nn\n\n0\n\n04-\n\n8\n\n0\n\n.-\n\n0\n\n.- c\n\n-\n\ng\n\n0 2 -\n\n0 -\n\nPhosphate\n\n(mM) A high phosphate level is known to inhibit whole-cell methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) activity and to result in the accumulation of  methanol in the culture medium.\" But it is not clear why M. trichosporium OB3b can  tolerate  more highly elevated phosphate concentrations than M. capsulatus (Bath). Both  the  propene  and  the  chloroform oxidative MMO  activities in  Figure 3  are  seen  to be constant  up  to  80  mM phosphate,  irrespective of  the decreasing trend  in  specific growth  rate. At  approximately 90-100 mM phosphate,  however, a  sharp increase in MMO propene activity was observed, yielding an absolute specific activity of 220 nmol/mg dry cell wt min.  This  higher propene  oxidative activity is due to the production of  pMMO, not  an elevated production of  sMMO, because cells grown on 100 mM or higher phosphate  do  not  display  any  detectable activity with chloroform (Fig. 3). This observation raised  an interesting question concerning the role of  phosphate in regulating the form of MMO, namely whether the shift in enzyme location is due to a high phosphate concentration per se or due to Cu contaminants  present  in  the  Na/K  salts  that  are used  in  preparing  high  phosphate  culture  medium. With 100 mM phosphate, it was observed that propene oxidative activity was high (ca. 200 nmol/mg  dry  cell  wt  min)  at  a  low  cell  density (A 6 6 0 = 0.28), but it declined to 95 nmol/mg dry cell wt min when the A6 6 0 reached 0.6. 0.2 p M for 100 mM phosphate medium compared to only 0.02 p M for 10 mM phosphate medium. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that  the production of  pMMO in Figure 3 at high phosphate concentrations is due to traces of  carry-over Cu contamination in the Na/K salts.",

With  an  initial medium  iron concentration below 40  mM, an abrupt decrease in sMMO activity was observed. The lowered  sMMO activity could be restored by supplying  additional iron  to the bioreactor culture. Key  words:  methanotroph soluble methane monooxygenase optimization o f   culture conditions",

In M. capsulatus (Bath), Dalton  et  al. noted that  a high  oxygen tension above a pOz of  0.1  atm inhibited  nitrogen assimilation and reduced the growth rate under nitrate- or ammonium-limiting conditions. However, Dalton's group reported  that  the enzyme lo-\n\ncation  in M. capsulatus (Bath) and M. trichosporium OB3b was determined by copper availability in the culture  medium:  MMO  activity was  found  in  the  membrane fraction when adequate copper was added, and in the  soluble fraction  when  copper  availability became limited.31  They  also suggested that  the  conditions  described by  Scott et al.30  masked the underlying copper effect.",

Cell  growth  was  inhibited progressively  by  phosphate  concentrations  above 40 mM. This is similar to previous results obtained by Harwood  and  Pirt13 with M. capsulatus (Bath),  although the phosphate concentration which is required\n\n-\n\n1 2\n\nI\n\n0\n\n-\n\nE\n\n1 0 -\n\n0 8 -\n\ncn\n\n5\n\n0 6 -\n\nn\n\n0\n\n04-\n\n8\n\n0\n\n.-\n\n0\n\n.- c\n\n-\n\ng\n\n0 2 -\n\n0 -\n\nPhosphate\n\n(mM) A high phosphate level is known to inhibit whole-cell methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) activity and to result in the accumulation of  methanol in the culture medium.\" But it is not clear why M. trichosporium OB3b can  tolerate  more highly elevated phosphate concentrations than M. capsulatus (Bath). Both  the  propene  and  the  chloroform oxidative MMO  activities in  Figure 3  are  seen  to be constant  up  to  80  mM phosphate,  irrespective of  the decreasing trend  in  specific growth  rate. At  approximately 90-100 mM phosphate,  however, a  sharp increase in MMO propene activity was observed, yielding an absolute specific activity of 220 nmol/mg dry cell wt min.  This  higher propene  oxidative activity is due to the production of  pMMO, not  an elevated production of  sMMO, because cells grown on 100 mM or higher phosphate  do  not  display  any  detectable activity with chloroform (Fig. 3). This observation raised  an interesting question concerning the role of  phosphate in regulating the form of MMO, namely whether the shift in enzyme location is due to a high phosphate concentration per se or due to Cu contaminants  present  in  the  Na/K  salts  that  are used  in  preparing  high  phosphate  culture  medium. With 100 mM phosphate, it was observed that propene oxidative activity was high (ca. 200 nmol/mg  dry  cell  wt  min)  at  a  low  cell  density (A 6 6 0 = 0.28), but it declined to 95 nmol/mg dry cell wt min when the A6 6 0 reached 0.6. 0.2 p M for 100 mM phosphate medium compared to only 0.02 p M for 10 mM phosphate medium. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that  the production of  pMMO in Figure 3 at high phosphate concentrations is due to traces of  carry-over Cu contamination in the Na/K salts.",
