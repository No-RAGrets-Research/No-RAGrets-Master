            "text_evidence": "Background Methane   (CH 4 ), as one of the major energy sources, easily escapes from the supply chain into the atmosphere, because it exists in a gaseous state under ambient conditions. Compared to carbon dioxide   (CO 2 ),   CH 4 is 25 times more potent at trapping radiation; thus, the emission of   CH 4 to the atmosphere causes severe global warming and climate change. To mitigate   CH 4 emissions and utilize them effectively, the direct biological conversion of   CH 4 into liquid fuels, such as methanol   (CH 3 OH), using methanotrophs is a promising strategy. However, supplying biocatalysts in an aqueous medium with   CH 4 involves high energy consumption due to vigorous agitation and/ or bubbling, which is a serious concern in methanotrophic processes, because the aqueous phase causes a very large barrier to the delivery of slightly soluble gases. Results An inverse membrane bioreactor (IMBR), which combines the advantages of gas-phase bioreactors and membrane bioreactors, was designed and constructed for the bioconversion of   CH 4 into   CH 3 OH in this study. In contrast to the conventional membrane bioreactor with bacterial cells that are immersed in an aqueous phase, the filtered cells were placed to face a gas phase in the IMBR to supply   CH 4 directly from the gas phase to bacterial cells. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative methanotroph, was used to demonstrate the bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH 3 OH in the IMBR. After optimizing the inlet concentration of   CH 4 , the mass of cells, the cyclopropanol concentration, and the gas flow rate, continuous   CH 3 OH production can be achieved over 72 h with productivity at 0.88 mmol   L -1",

            "text_evidence": "Background Methane   (CH 4 ), as one of the major energy sources, easily escapes from the supply chain into the atmosphere, because it exists in a gaseous state under ambient conditions. Compared to carbon dioxide   (CO 2 ),   CH 4 is 25 times more potent at trapping radiation; thus, the emission of   CH 4 to the atmosphere causes severe global warming and climate change. To mitigate   CH 4 emissions and utilize them effectively, the direct biological conversion of   CH 4 into liquid fuels, such as methanol   (CH 3 OH), using methanotrophs is a promising strategy. However, supplying biocatalysts in an aqueous medium with   CH 4 involves high energy consumption due to vigorous agitation and/ or bubbling, which is a serious concern in methanotrophic processes, because the aqueous phase causes a very large barrier to the delivery of slightly soluble gases. Results An inverse membrane bioreactor (IMBR), which combines the advantages of gas-phase bioreactors and membrane bioreactors, was designed and constructed for the bioconversion of   CH 4 into   CH 3 OH in this study. In contrast to the conventional membrane bioreactor with bacterial cells that are immersed in an aqueous phase, the filtered cells were placed to face a gas phase in the IMBR to supply   CH 4 directly from the gas phase to bacterial cells. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative methanotroph, was used to demonstrate the bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH 3 OH in the IMBR. After optimizing the inlet concentration of   CH 4 , the mass of cells, the cyclopropanol concentration, and the gas flow rate, continuous   CH 3 OH production can be achieved over 72 h with productivity at 0.88 mmol   L -1",

            "text_evidence": "Background Methane   (CH 4 ), as one of the major energy sources, easily escapes from the supply chain into the atmosphere, because it exists in a gaseous state under ambient conditions. Compared to carbon dioxide   (CO 2 ),   CH 4 is 25 times more potent at trapping radiation; thus, the emission of   CH 4 to the atmosphere causes severe global warming and climate change. To mitigate   CH 4 emissions and utilize them effectively, the direct biological conversion of   CH 4 into liquid fuels, such as methanol   (CH 3 OH), using methanotrophs is a promising strategy. However, supplying biocatalysts in an aqueous medium with   CH 4 involves high energy consumption due to vigorous agitation and/ or bubbling, which is a serious concern in methanotrophic processes, because the aqueous phase causes a very large barrier to the delivery of slightly soluble gases. Results An inverse membrane bioreactor (IMBR), which combines the advantages of gas-phase bioreactors and membrane bioreactors, was designed and constructed for the bioconversion of   CH 4 into   CH 3 OH in this study. In contrast to the conventional membrane bioreactor with bacterial cells that are immersed in an aqueous phase, the filtered cells were placed to face a gas phase in the IMBR to supply   CH 4 directly from the gas phase to bacterial cells. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative methanotroph, was used to demonstrate the bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH 3 OH in the IMBR. After optimizing the inlet concentration of   CH 4 , the mass of cells, the cyclopropanol concentration, and the gas flow rate, continuous   CH 3 OH production can be achieved over 72 h with productivity at 0.88 mmol   L -1",

            "text_evidence": "Methane    (CH 4 ),  the  main  component  of  biogas,  shale gas, and gas hydrate, has been used as the major energy resource for humans. After the shale gas revolution in the United States,   CH 4 became a popular chemical feedstock due to its high availability. However, because   CH 4 exists in a gaseous state in ambient conditions, large amounts of    CH 4 dissipation  occur  through  the  entire  gas  supply chain,  resulting  in  severe  greenhouse  effects Of  the various  candidate  technologies  for  effectively  utilizing CH4, liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  is  a  common  form  to transport    CH 4 from  its  production  site  to  distant  consumption sites. Converting   CH 4 into methanol   (CH3OH) through  a  gas-to-liquid  (GTL)  technique  has  attracted much attention because of the ease of storage and transportation  of  liquid    CH 3 OH However,  the  chemical process of producing   CH 3 OH through direct functionalization of   CH 4 is  energy intensive (the reaction temperature is approximately 900\u00a0\u00b0C and the operation pressure is 0.5-4\u00a0MPa) due to the high energy to cleave the C-H bond of   CH 4 (104\u00a0kcal\u00a0  mol -1 ) The use of methanotrophs, which are methane-oxidizing microorganisms, as whole-cell catalysts has attracted great attention, because methanotrophs can biologically convert    CH 4 to    CH3OH by their  methane  monooxygenase (MMO) under ambient conditions in a single step [5-7]. Although    CH 4 bioconversion  shows  great  potential as an economical GTL technology, it still faces some difficulties in achieving efficient conversion for commercialization. One of the difficulties occurs due to the low solubility of   CH 4 and oxygen   (O 2 ) in water. Since the conventional methanotrophic process is generally conducted in the aqueous phase [8-13], the limitation of the amount of dissolved   CH 4 results in a low productivity of   CH3OH. Although various configurations of bioreactors for methanotrophic reactions have been proposed to enhance the process of dissolving   CH 4 in the aqueous phase, such as stirred tank reactors and bubble-lift reactors [14-16], the process consumes high amounts of energy to deliver gaseous substrates to the cells by stirring or bubbling. In  the  case  of  methanotrophs,  cells  immobilized  on  polypropylene  rings  or porous building materials have been used for   CH 4 degradation  in  the  gas  phase In fact, our previous study showed that the degradation rate of   CH 4 by Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) cells encapsulated in alginate gel was as slow as that in a static aqueous phase [23].",

            "text_evidence": "Methane    (CH 4 ),  the  main  component  of  biogas,  shale gas, and gas hydrate, has been used as the major energy resource for humans. After the shale gas revolution in the United States,   CH 4 became a popular chemical feedstock due to its high availability. However, because   CH 4 exists in a gaseous state in ambient conditions, large amounts of    CH 4 dissipation  occur  through  the  entire  gas  supply chain,  resulting  in  severe  greenhouse  effects Of  the various  candidate  technologies  for  effectively  utilizing CH4, liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  is  a  common  form  to transport    CH 4 from  its  production  site  to  distant  consumption sites. Converting   CH 4 into methanol   (CH3OH) through  a  gas-to-liquid  (GTL)  technique  has  attracted much attention because of the ease of storage and transportation  of  liquid    CH 3 OH However,  the  chemical process of producing   CH 3 OH through direct functionalization of   CH 4 is  energy intensive (the reaction temperature is approximately 900\u00a0\u00b0C and the operation pressure is 0.5-4\u00a0MPa) due to the high energy to cleave the C-H bond of   CH 4 (104\u00a0kcal\u00a0  mol -1 ) The use of methanotrophs, which are methane-oxidizing microorganisms, as whole-cell catalysts has attracted great attention, because methanotrophs can biologically convert    CH 4 to    CH3OH by their  methane  monooxygenase (MMO) under ambient conditions in a single step [5-7]. Although    CH 4 bioconversion  shows  great  potential as an economical GTL technology, it still faces some difficulties in achieving efficient conversion for commercialization. One of the difficulties occurs due to the low solubility of   CH 4 and oxygen   (O 2 ) in water. Since the conventional methanotrophic process is generally conducted in the aqueous phase [8-13], the limitation of the amount of dissolved   CH 4 results in a low productivity of   CH3OH. Although various configurations of bioreactors for methanotrophic reactions have been proposed to enhance the process of dissolving   CH 4 in the aqueous phase, such as stirred tank reactors and bubble-lift reactors [14-16], the process consumes high amounts of energy to deliver gaseous substrates to the cells by stirring or bubbling. In  the  case  of  methanotrophs,  cells  immobilized  on  polypropylene  rings  or porous building materials have been used for   CH 4 degradation  in  the  gas  phase In fact, our previous study showed that the degradation rate of   CH 4 by Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) cells encapsulated in alginate gel was as slow as that in a static aqueous phase [23].",

The  water  level  in  the  solution container remained lower than the position of the membrane sheet in the IMBR, generating negative pressure in the  direction  from  the  filtered  cells  to  the  liquid  chamber. Using this new IMBR, bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH3OH was  performed. After infusing   CH 4 into the IMBR, the concentration  of    CH 4 decreased  from  20%  ( v / v )  at  the  inlet  to 19.6% ( v / v )  at  the  outlet. in  the  IMBR with a batch operation of the aqueous phase. h -1 ,  which was significantly enhanced in the IMBR compared with the  conventional  MBR  operated  as  a  negative  control (Fig.\u00a0 2),  while  the  overall  conversion of   CH 4 to    CH3OH was 24.4% and 23.5% in the IMBR and the conventional MBR,  respectively. Thus, the gas-phase bioreaction in the IMBR increased  the  rate  of    CH 4 consumption  compared  with that  of  the  aqueous-phase  bioreaction  and  caused  an increase in the rate of   CH3OH production.",

The  water  level  in  the  solution container remained lower than the position of the membrane sheet in the IMBR, generating negative pressure in the  direction  from  the  filtered  cells  to  the  liquid  chamber. Using this new IMBR, bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH3OH was  performed. After infusing   CH 4 into the IMBR, the concentration  of    CH 4 decreased  from  20%  ( v / v )  at  the  inlet  to 19.6% ( v / v )  at  the  outlet. in  the  IMBR with a batch operation of the aqueous phase. h -1 ,  which was significantly enhanced in the IMBR compared with the  conventional  MBR  operated  as  a  negative  control (Fig.\u00a0 2),  while  the  overall  conversion of   CH 4 to    CH3OH was 24.4% and 23.5% in the IMBR and the conventional MBR,  respectively. Thus, the gas-phase bioreaction in the IMBR increased  the  rate  of    CH 4 consumption  compared  with that  of  the  aqueous-phase  bioreaction  and  caused  an increase in the rate of   CH3OH production.",

For this purpose, M. capsulatus (Bath) cells of 12.5\u00a0mg-DCW on the membrane were faced  the  gas  phase  in  the  IMBR,  in  which  the  bottom liquid  chamber  carried  10\u00a0 mL  of  the  aqueous  solution containing 10\u00a0\u03bcM cyclopropanol and 10\u00a0mM sodium formate, with circulation at 10\u00a0mL\u00a0  min -1 . Therefore, the optimal   CH 4 concentration was 20%\u00a0( v/v )  under the operating conditions of the IMBR. We also examined the effect of the mass of filtered M. capsulatus (Bath)  cells  on  the    CH 4 consumption  and CH3OH production in the  IMBR. For  this  purpose, M. capsulatus (Bath)  cells  from  6.25  to  100\u00a0 mg-DCW  on the  membrane  were  faced  the  gas  phase  in  the  IMBR, which was run in the same manner as above except that the   CH 4 concentration in the inlet gas was fixed at 20% ( v / v ). Therefore, the mass of the cells is  the  optimum  at  12.5\u00a0 mg-DCW  under  the  operating conditions for the IMBR. Moreover,  we  investigated  the  effect  of  the  concentration  of  cyclopropanol  in  the  aqueous  solution  on the    CH 4 consumption  and    CH 3 OH production  in  the IMBR.

Figure\u00a06a shows the concentrations of  exhausted    CH 4 and  accumulated    CH 3 OH  in  three periods  with  three  different  concentrations  of  cyclopropanol. In the first 3\u00a0h of operation,   CH3OH was not produced because of the absence of cyclopropanol, and the exhausted   CH 4 concentration remained at approximately  17.8%\u00a0 ( v/v ). During  the  period  with  1\u00a0 \u03bcM cyclopropanol,  a  small  amount  of    CH3OH  was  produced. At 6\u00a0h, the  solution  was  exchanged  again,  and  the  concentration of cyclopropanol was increased to 10\u00a0\u03bcM. During this period, although the exhausted   CH 4 concentration increased to 19.3%\u00a0( v/v ),   CH 3 OH was significantly accumulated and reached over 2\u00a0mM. With the same conditions as above except for  the  aqueous  phase,  which  contained  20\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol, its effects on the concentrations of exhausted CH4 and accumulated   CH3OH are shown in Fig. A higher concentration of cyclopropanol was expected to greatly inhibit MDH activity to produce more   CH3OH. However, the maximum accumulated   CH3OH concentration  reached  only  1\u00a0 mM  in  7\u00a0 h,  and  the  exhausted CH4 kept about 19.4%\u00a0( v/v ),  while  the  maximum conversion decreased to approximately 20% by the increase in  the  cyclopropanol concentration (Additional file\u00a06). Thus,  the  optimal  cyclopropanol  concentration  was 10\u00a0 \u03bcM  under  the  operating  conditions  of  the  IMBR. However, at all the cyclopropanol concentrations tested,  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH decreased with  time,  suggesting  that  the  continuous  supply  of cyclopropanol is necessary to maintain the conversion. 0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nCH3OH concentration (mM)\n\nCH4 concentration (% (v/v))\n\nTime (h)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nCH3OH concentration (mM)\n\nCH4 concentration (% (v/v))\n\nTime (h)\n\n10 mM Formate\n\n+ 0 \u03bcM Cyclopropanol\n\n10 mM Formate\n\n+ 1 \u03bcM Cyclopropanol\n\n10 mM Formate\n\n+ 10 \u03bcM Cyclopropanol\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nExhausted CH4\n\nAccumulated CH3OH\n\nExhausted CH4\n\nAccumulated CH3OH\n\n(a)",

In the first 3\u00a0h of operation,   CH3OH was not produced because of the absence of cyclopropanol, and the exhausted   CH 4 concentration remained at approximately  17.8%\u00a0 ( v/v ).

During  the  period  with  1\u00a0 \u03bcM cyclopropanol,  a  small  amount  of    CH3OH  was  produced. However,  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH was  not  sustained  and  decreased  from  4.6%  to  1.6% (Additional  file\u00a0 5). With the same conditions as above except for  the  aqueous  phase,  which  contained  20\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol, its effects on the concentrations of exhausted CH4 and accumulated   CH3OH are shown in Fig. A higher concentration of cyclopropanol was expected to greatly inhibit MDH activity to produce more   CH3OH. However, the maximum accumulated   CH3OH concentration  reached  only  1\u00a0 mM  in  7\u00a0 h,  and  the  exhausted CH4 kept about 19.4%\u00a0( v/v ),  while  the  maximum conversion decreased to approximately 20% by the increase in  the  cyclopropanol concentration (Additional file\u00a06). However, at all the cyclopropanol concentrations tested,  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH decreased with  time,  suggesting  that  the  continuous  supply  of cyclopropanol is necessary to maintain the conversion. 0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nCH3OH concentration (mM)\n\nCH4 concentration (% (v/v))\n\nTime (h)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nCH3OH concentration (mM)\n\nCH4 concentration (% (v/v))\n\nTime (h)\n\n10 mM Formate\n\n+ 0 \u03bcM Cyclopropanol\n\n10 mM Formate\n\n+ 1 \u03bcM Cyclopropanol\n\n10 mM Formate\n\n+ 10 \u03bcM Cyclopropanol\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nExhausted CH4\n\nAccumulated CH3OH\n\nExhausted CH4\n\nAccumulated CH3OH\n\n(a)",

A  mixed  gas  containing  20%  ( v / v )    CH 4 and air was continuously supplied into a 2.5-mL gas chamber  of  the  IMBR,  in  which M.  capsulatus (Bath)  cells of  12.5\u00a0 mg-DCW  on  the  glass  fiber  filter  were  faced the  gas  phase,  and  the  same  volume  of  supplied  gas was  exhausted  from  the  gas  chamber. A  total  volume of  10\u00a0 mL  of  the  medium  containing  10\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol and 10\u00a0mM sodium formate, as well as 9.9\u00a0mM nitrate  as  a  nitrogen  source,  was  circulated  through  a 2.5\u00a0 mL  liquid  chamber  of  the  IMBR  at  10\u00a0 mL\u00a0   min -1 using  a  peristaltic  pump. The    CH 4 consumption  rate  in  the  IMBR  remained  constant  at approximately 23\u00a0\u03bcmol This suggests that the space time of   CH 4 in the IMBR is too short to maintain the same   CH 4 consumption rate as that at 1\u00a0mL\u00a0  min -1 when the gas flow rate is above 1.5\u00a0mL\u00a0  min -1 . Then, we tried to run the IMBR by flowing the gas at 0.2\u00a0mL\u00a0  min -1 in its gas chamber for more\n\nCH.OH in the IMPR h Efforts of the das flow rate on the\n\nSARAN\n\n(b)\n\n= Consumption rate\n\n\u2026 Consumption ratio\n\nthan 3 d for the continuous bioconversion of   CH 4 into CH3OH by a microbial gas-phase reaction.",

In  the  IMBR,  gas  pressurizing  is  unnecessary,  because cells  on  the  membrane  are  placed  in  the  gas  phase. In the  IMBR, the high   CH 3OH productivity was achieved, even  though  the  gas  flow  rate  was  0.2\u00a0 mL\u00a0   min -1 into 2.5\u00a0mL of a reaction volume (gas chamber) Of course, we should note that cell separation is unnecessary for purification of   CH3OH in the IMBR, unlike most of other methods Of course, the  similar  simulations  are  also  useful  when  scaling  up and/or  modifying  the  configuration  of  IMBRs. Multiple  IMBRs  can  also  be  stacked  or  arranged  for  further scale-up.",

When  the  cyclopropanol  concentration  provided  to  the  aqueous  solution increased from 0\u00a0\u03bcM, 1\u00a0\u03bcM, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM, the   CH4 consumption  ratio  decreased  from  11%,  10%,  and  3.7%, respectively,  while  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH increased  from  0%,  4.6%,  and  60%,  respectively  (Additional  file\u00a0 5). However,  the  slight  decrease  in  the    CH 4 consumption  ratio  to  2.9%  but  the  large  decrease  in the  maximum  conversion  to  19%  at  20\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol suggested that a high concentration of this MDH inhibitor  lowers  the  MMO  activity  (Additional  file\u00a0 6). Therefore,  10\u00a0 \u03bcM  was  the  optimum  concentration  of cyclopropanol  for  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH under  the  experimental  conditions  for  Fig.\u00a0 6. The  optimum concentration  of  cyclopropanol  seems  to  depend on the amount of cells; the decrease in the   CH 4 conversion into   CH3OH that was observed when the amount of the filtered cells increased from 12.5\u00a0mg-DCW to 25\u00a0mgDCW at 10\u00a0\u03bcM cyclopropanol, as shown in Fig.\u00a05b, suggests  that  this  cyclopropanol  concentration  was  not enough to effectively inhibit MDH in the increased cells. The continuous supply of formate and cyclopropanol is also thought to be important for keeping the stable activity to avoid the lack of reducing power and the decrease in the inhibitory activity for MDH.",

When  the  cyclopropanol  concentration  provided  to  the  aqueous  solution increased from 0\u00a0\u03bcM, 1\u00a0\u03bcM, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM, the   CH4 consumption  ratio  decreased  from  11%,  10%,  and  3.7%, respectively,  while  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH increased  from  0%,  4.6%,  and  60%,  respectively  (Additional  file\u00a0 5). However,  the  slight  decrease  in  the    CH 4 consumption  ratio  to  2.9%  but  the  large  decrease  in the  maximum  conversion  to  19%  at  20\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol suggested that a high concentration of this MDH inhibitor  lowers  the  MMO  activity  (Additional  file\u00a0 6). Therefore,  10\u00a0 \u03bcM  was  the  optimum  concentration  of cyclopropanol  for  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH under  the  experimental  conditions  for  Fig.\u00a0 6. The  optimum concentration  of  cyclopropanol  seems  to  depend on the amount of cells; the decrease in the   CH 4 conversion into   CH3OH that was observed when the amount of the filtered cells increased from 12.5\u00a0mg-DCW to 25\u00a0mgDCW at 10\u00a0\u03bcM cyclopropanol, as shown in Fig.\u00a05b, suggests  that  this  cyclopropanol  concentration  was  not enough to effectively inhibit MDH in the increased cells. The continuous supply of formate and cyclopropanol is also thought to be important for keeping the stable activity to avoid the lack of reducing power and the decrease in the inhibitory activity for MDH.",

Compared to carbon dioxide   (CO 2 ),   CH 4 is 25 times more potent at trapping radiation; thus, the emission of   CH 4 to the atmosphere causes severe global warming and climate change. To mitigate   CH 4 emissions and utilize them effectively, the direct biological conversion of   CH 4 into liquid fuels, such as methanol   (CH 3 OH), using methanotrophs is a promising strategy. However, supplying biocatalysts in an aqueous medium with   CH 4 involves high energy consumption due to vigorous agitation and/ or bubbling, which is a serious concern in methanotrophic processes, because the aqueous phase causes a very large barrier to the delivery of slightly soluble gases. Results An inverse membrane bioreactor (IMBR), which combines the advantages of gas-phase bioreactors and membrane bioreactors, was designed and constructed for the bioconversion of   CH 4 into   CH 3 OH in this study. In contrast to the conventional membrane bioreactor with bacterial cells that are immersed in an aqueous phase, the filtered cells were placed to face a gas phase in the IMBR to supply   CH 4 directly from the gas phase to bacterial cells. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative methanotroph, was used to demonstrate the bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH 3 OH in the IMBR. After optimizing the inlet concentration of   CH 4 , the mass of cells, the cyclopropanol concentration, and the gas flow rate, continuous   CH 3 OH production can be achieved over 72 h with productivity at 0.88 mmol   L -1",

        "text_evidence": "Background Methane   (CH 4 ), as one of the major energy sources, easily escapes from the supply chain into the atmosphere, because it exists in a gaseous state under ambient conditions. Compared to carbon dioxide   (CO 2 ),   CH 4 is 25 times more potent at trapping radiation; thus, the emission of   CH 4 to the atmosphere causes severe global warming and climate change. To mitigate   CH 4 emissions and utilize them effectively, the direct biological conversion of   CH 4 into liquid fuels, such as methanol   (CH 3 OH), using methanotrophs is a promising strategy. However, supplying biocatalysts in an aqueous medium with   CH 4 involves high energy consumption due to vigorous agitation and/ or bubbling, which is a serious concern in methanotrophic processes, because the aqueous phase causes a very large barrier to the delivery of slightly soluble gases. Results An inverse membrane bioreactor (IMBR), which combines the advantages of gas-phase bioreactors and membrane bioreactors, was designed and constructed for the bioconversion of   CH 4 into   CH 3 OH in this study. In contrast to the conventional membrane bioreactor with bacterial cells that are immersed in an aqueous phase, the filtered cells were placed to face a gas phase in the IMBR to supply   CH 4 directly from the gas phase to bacterial cells. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative methanotroph, was used to demonstrate the bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH 3 OH in the IMBR. After optimizing the inlet concentration of   CH 4 , the mass of cells, the cyclopropanol concentration, and the gas flow rate, continuous   CH 3 OH production can be achieved over 72 h with productivity at 0.88 mmol   L -1",

        "text_evidence": "Methane    (CH 4 ),  the  main  component  of  biogas,  shale gas, and gas hydrate, has been used as the major energy resource for humans. After the shale gas revolution in the United States,   CH 4 became a popular chemical feedstock due to its high availability. However, because   CH 4 exists in a gaseous state in ambient conditions, large amounts of    CH 4 dissipation  occur  through  the  entire  gas  supply chain,  resulting  in  severe  greenhouse  effects Of  the various  candidate  technologies  for  effectively  utilizing CH4, liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  is  a  common  form  to transport    CH 4 from  its  production  site  to  distant  consumption sites. Converting   CH 4 into methanol   (CH3OH) through  a  gas-to-liquid  (GTL)  technique  has  attracted much attention because of the ease of storage and transportation  of  liquid    CH 3 OH However,  the  chemical process of producing   CH 3 OH through direct functionalization of   CH 4 is  energy intensive (the reaction temperature is approximately 900\u00a0\u00b0C and the operation pressure is 0.5-4\u00a0MPa) due to the high energy to cleave the C-H bond of   CH 4 (104\u00a0kcal\u00a0  mol -1 ) The use of methanotrophs, which are methane-oxidizing microorganisms, as whole-cell catalysts has attracted great attention, because methanotrophs can biologically convert    CH 4 to    CH3OH by their  methane  monooxygenase (MMO) under ambient conditions in a single step [5-7]. Although    CH 4 bioconversion  shows  great  potential as an economical GTL technology, it still faces some difficulties in achieving efficient conversion for commercialization. One of the difficulties occurs due to the low solubility of   CH 4 and oxygen   (O 2 ) in water. Since the conventional methanotrophic process is generally conducted in the aqueous phase [8-13], the limitation of the amount of dissolved   CH 4 results in a low productivity of   CH3OH. Although various configurations of bioreactors for methanotrophic reactions have been proposed to enhance the process of dissolving   CH 4 in the aqueous phase, such as stirred tank reactors and bubble-lift reactors [14-16], the process consumes high amounts of energy to deliver gaseous substrates to the cells by stirring or bubbling. In  the  case  of  methanotrophs,  cells  immobilized  on  polypropylene  rings  or porous building materials have been used for   CH 4 degradation  in  the  gas  phase In fact, our previous study showed that the degradation rate of   CH 4 by Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) cells encapsulated in alginate gel was as slow as that in a static aqueous phase [23].",

The  water  level  in  the  solution container remained lower than the position of the membrane sheet in the IMBR, generating negative pressure in the  direction  from  the  filtered  cells  to  the  liquid  chamber. Using this new IMBR, bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH3OH was  performed. After infusing   CH 4 into the IMBR, the concentration  of    CH 4 decreased  from  20%  ( v / v )  at  the  inlet  to 19.6% ( v / v )  at  the  outlet. in  the  IMBR with a batch operation of the aqueous phase. h -1 ,  which was significantly enhanced in the IMBR compared with the  conventional  MBR  operated  as  a  negative  control (Fig.\u00a0 2),  while  the  overall  conversion of   CH 4 to    CH3OH was 24.4% and 23.5% in the IMBR and the conventional MBR,  respectively.

The  water  level  in  the  solution container remained lower than the position of the membrane sheet in the IMBR, generating negative pressure in the  direction  from  the  filtered  cells  to  the  liquid  chamber. Using this new IMBR, bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH3OH was  performed. After infusing   CH 4 into the IMBR, the concentration  of    CH 4 decreased  from  20%  ( v / v )  at  the  inlet  to 19.6% ( v / v )  at  the  outlet. in  the  IMBR with a batch operation of the aqueous phase. h -1 ,  which was significantly enhanced in the IMBR compared with the  conventional  MBR  operated  as  a  negative  control (Fig.\u00a0 2),  while  the  overall  conversion of   CH 4 to    CH3OH was 24.4% and 23.5% in the IMBR and the conventional MBR,  respectively. Thus, the gas-phase bioreaction in the IMBR increased  the  rate  of    CH 4 consumption  compared  with that  of  the  aqueous-phase  bioreaction  and  caused  an increase in the rate of   CH3OH production.",

This IMBR with the large gas chamber  was  compared  with  the  previously  mentioned  IMBR  with  the  smaller  gas  chamber  in  terms of  the  consumption ratio of   CH 4 . The  glass  fiber  filter with 10\u00a0mg-DCW of filtered M. capsulatus (Bath) cells was set between the gas and liquid chambers of these IMBRs,  and  the  aqueous  solution  in  the  absence  of cyclopropanol and sodium formate was infused into the liquid chamber and circulated at 10\u00a0mL\u00a0  min -1 . As shown in Fig.\u00a04c, in the IMBR with the larger gas chamber, the   CH 4 concentration at the outlet decreased to 19.0%\u00a0( v/v ) during the first 1.5\u00a0h and remained constant afterward. When the IMBR with the smaller gas chamber was  used,  the  exhausted    CH 4 concentration  decreased sharply over time, reaching 17.6%\u00a0( v/v ) after 1\u00a0h, and then became constant at approximately 17.5%\u00a0( v/v ). Therefore, other operating conditions  had  to  be  examined  to  improve  the  consumption ratio of   CH 4,  and the IMBR with a 2.5\u00a0mL gas chamber was used in further experiments.",

This IMBR with the large gas chamber  was  compared  with  the  previously  mentioned  IMBR  with  the  smaller  gas  chamber  in  terms of  the  consumption ratio of   CH 4 . The  glass  fiber  filter with 10\u00a0mg-DCW of filtered M. capsulatus (Bath) cells was set between the gas and liquid chambers of these IMBRs,  and  the  aqueous  solution  in  the  absence  of cyclopropanol and sodium formate was infused into the liquid chamber and circulated at 10\u00a0mL\u00a0  min -1 . As shown in Fig.\u00a04c, in the IMBR with the larger gas chamber, the   CH 4 concentration at the outlet decreased to 19.0%\u00a0( v/v ) during the first 1.5\u00a0h and remained constant afterward. When the IMBR with the smaller gas chamber was  used,  the  exhausted    CH 4 concentration  decreased sharply over time, reaching 17.6%\u00a0( v/v ) after 1\u00a0h, and then became constant at approximately 17.5%\u00a0( v/v ). Therefore, other operating conditions  had  to  be  examined  to  improve  the  consumption ratio of   CH 4,  and the IMBR with a 2.5\u00a0mL gas chamber was used in further experiments.",

Figure\u00a06a shows the concentrations of  exhausted    CH 4 and  accumulated    CH 3 OH  in  three periods  with  three  different  concentrations  of  cyclopropanol. In the first 3\u00a0h of operation,   CH3OH was not produced because of the absence of cyclopropanol, and the exhausted   CH 4 concentration remained at approximately  17.8%\u00a0 ( v/v ). During  the  period  with  1\u00a0 \u03bcM cyclopropanol,  a  small  amount  of    CH3OH  was  produced. At 6\u00a0h, the  solution  was  exchanged  again,  and  the  concentration of cyclopropanol was increased to 10\u00a0\u03bcM. During this period, although the exhausted   CH 4 concentration increased to 19.3%\u00a0( v/v ),   CH 3 OH was significantly accumulated and reached over 2\u00a0mM. With the same conditions as above except for  the  aqueous  phase,  which  contained  20\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol, its effects on the concentrations of exhausted CH4 and accumulated   CH3OH are shown in Fig. A higher concentration of cyclopropanol was expected to greatly inhibit MDH activity to produce more   CH3OH.

Figure\u00a06a shows the concentrations of  exhausted    CH 4 and  accumulated    CH 3 OH  in  three periods  with  three  different  concentrations  of  cyclopropanol. In the first 3\u00a0h of operation,   CH3OH was not produced because of the absence of cyclopropanol, and the exhausted   CH 4 concentration remained at approximately  17.8%\u00a0 ( v/v ). During  the  period  with  1\u00a0 \u03bcM cyclopropanol,  a  small  amount  of    CH3OH  was  produced. At 6\u00a0h, the  solution  was  exchanged  again,  and  the  concentration of cyclopropanol was increased to 10\u00a0\u03bcM. During this period, although the exhausted   CH 4 concentration increased to 19.3%\u00a0( v/v ),   CH 3 OH was significantly accumulated and reached over 2\u00a0mM. With the same conditions as above except for  the  aqueous  phase,  which  contained  20\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol, its effects on the concentrations of exhausted CH4 and accumulated   CH3OH are shown in Fig. A higher concentration of cyclopropanol was expected to greatly inhibit MDH activity to produce more   CH3OH. However, the maximum accumulated   CH3OH concentration  reached  only  1\u00a0 mM  in  7\u00a0 h,  and  the  exhausted CH4 kept about 19.4%\u00a0( v/v ),  while  the  maximum conversion decreased to approximately 20% by the increase in  the  cyclopropanol concentration (Additional file\u00a06). Thus,  the  optimal  cyclopropanol  concentration  was 10\u00a0 \u03bcM  under  the  operating  conditions  of  the  IMBR. However, at all the cyclopropanol concentrations tested,  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH decreased with  time,  suggesting  that  the  continuous  supply  of cyclopropanol is necessary to maintain the conversion. 0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nCH3OH concentration (mM)\n\nCH4 concentration (% (v/v))\n\nTime (h)\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\nCH3OH concentration (mM)\n\nCH4 concentration (% (v/v))\n\nTime (h)\n\n10 mM Formate\n\n+ 0 \u03bcM Cyclopropanol\n\n10 mM Formate\n\n+ 1 \u03bcM Cyclopropanol\n\n10 mM Formate\n\n+ 10 \u03bcM Cyclopropanol\n\n(a)\n\n(b)\n\nExhausted CH4\n\nAccumulated CH3OH\n\nExhausted CH4\n\nAccumulated CH3OH\n\n(a)",

Figure\u00a06a shows the concentrations of  exhausted    CH 4 and  accumulated    CH 3 OH  in  three periods  with  three  different  concentrations  of  cyclopropanol. In the first 3\u00a0h of operation,   CH3OH was not produced because of the absence of cyclopropanol, and the exhausted   CH 4 concentration remained at approximately  17.8%\u00a0 ( v/v ). During  the  period  with  1\u00a0 \u03bcM cyclopropanol,  a  small  amount  of    CH3OH  was  produced. At 6\u00a0h, the  solution  was  exchanged  again,  and  the  concentration of cyclopropanol was increased to 10\u00a0\u03bcM. During this period, although the exhausted   CH 4 concentration increased to 19.3%\u00a0( v/v ),   CH 3 OH was significantly accumulated and reached over 2\u00a0mM.

A  mixed  gas  containing  20%  ( v / v )    CH 4 and air was continuously supplied into a 2.5-mL gas chamber  of  the  IMBR,  in  which M.  capsulatus (Bath)  cells of  12.5\u00a0 mg-DCW  on  the  glass  fiber  filter  were  faced the  gas  phase,  and  the  same  volume  of  supplied  gas was  exhausted  from  the  gas  chamber. A  total  volume of  10\u00a0 mL  of  the  medium  containing  10\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol and 10\u00a0mM sodium formate, as well as 9.9\u00a0mM nitrate  as  a  nitrogen  source,  was  circulated  through  a 2.5\u00a0 mL  liquid  chamber  of  the  IMBR  at  10\u00a0 mL\u00a0   min -1 using  a  peristaltic  pump. The    CH 4 consumption  rate  in  the  IMBR  remained  constant  at approximately 23\u00a0\u03bcmol This suggests that the space time of   CH 4 in the IMBR is too short to maintain the same   CH 4 consumption rate as that at 1\u00a0mL\u00a0  min -1 when the gas flow rate is above 1.5\u00a0mL\u00a0  min -1 .

When  the  cyclopropanol  concentration  provided  to  the  aqueous  solution increased from 0\u00a0\u03bcM, 1\u00a0\u03bcM, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM, the   CH4 consumption  ratio  decreased  from  11%,  10%,  and  3.7%, respectively,  while  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH increased  from  0%,  4.6%,  and  60%,  respectively  (Additional  file\u00a0 5). However,  the  slight  decrease  in  the    CH 4 consumption  ratio  to  2.9%  but  the  large  decrease  in the  maximum  conversion  to  19%  at  20\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol suggested that a high concentration of this MDH inhibitor  lowers  the  MMO  activity  (Additional  file\u00a0 6). Therefore,  10\u00a0 \u03bcM  was  the  optimum  concentration  of cyclopropanol  for  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH under  the  experimental  conditions  for  Fig.\u00a0 6. The  optimum concentration  of  cyclopropanol  seems  to  depend on the amount of cells; the decrease in the   CH 4 conversion into   CH3OH that was observed when the amount of the filtered cells increased from 12.5\u00a0mg-DCW to 25\u00a0mgDCW at 10\u00a0\u03bcM cyclopropanol, as shown in Fig.\u00a05b, suggests  that  this  cyclopropanol  concentration  was  not enough to effectively inhibit MDH in the increased cells. The continuous supply of formate and cyclopropanol is also thought to be important for keeping the stable activity to avoid the lack of reducing power and the decrease in the inhibitory activity for MDH.",

When  the  cyclopropanol  concentration  provided  to  the  aqueous  solution increased from 0\u00a0\u03bcM, 1\u00a0\u03bcM, and 10\u00a0\u03bcM, the   CH4 consumption  ratio  decreased  from  11%,  10%,  and  3.7%, respectively,  while  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH increased  from  0%,  4.6%,  and  60%,  respectively  (Additional  file\u00a0 5). However,  the  slight  decrease  in  the    CH 4 consumption  ratio  to  2.9%  but  the  large  decrease  in the  maximum  conversion  to  19%  at  20\u00a0 \u03bcM  cyclopropanol suggested that a high concentration of this MDH inhibitor  lowers  the  MMO  activity  (Additional  file\u00a0 6). Therefore,  10\u00a0 \u03bcM  was  the  optimum  concentration  of cyclopropanol  for  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH under  the  experimental  conditions  for  Fig.\u00a0 6. The  optimum concentration  of  cyclopropanol  seems  to  depend on the amount of cells; the decrease in the   CH 4 conversion into   CH3OH that was observed when the amount of the filtered cells increased from 12.5\u00a0mg-DCW to 25\u00a0mgDCW at 10\u00a0\u03bcM cyclopropanol, as shown in Fig.\u00a05b, suggests  that  this  cyclopropanol  concentration  was  not enough to effectively inhibit MDH in the increased cells. The continuous supply of formate and cyclopropanol is also thought to be important for keeping the stable activity to avoid the lack of reducing power and the decrease in the inhibitory activity for MDH.",
