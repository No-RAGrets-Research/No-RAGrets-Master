This rate of  methanol biosynthesis continued  for  1 1   h  after  which  a  fall  in  the  rate  was observed.  Based  on  earlier  batch  studies, this was  attributed to depletion of intracellular NADH2 pool. The in vivo regeneration of NADH2 in the continuous reactor was carried out by supplying different concentrations of  sodium formate in 20 or 100 mM phosphate buffer, and  the  results  are  shown  in  Figure 5.
