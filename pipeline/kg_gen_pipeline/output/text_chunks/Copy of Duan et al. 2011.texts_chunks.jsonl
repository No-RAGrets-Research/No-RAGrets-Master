{"chunk": "[Section: 1. Introduction]\nMethanol is a basic raw chemical material and an intermediate for production of dimethyl ether and biodiesel. Currently, methanol is made from synthesis gas (CO + H2), obtained mainly from natural gas and coal. This process is characterized by high energy consumption, low conversion rates and high capital costs. In contrast, biotransformation of methane to methanol would require less energy input, be more selective and productive. This process is carried out by whole cells of methanotrophs under mild conditions with a 100% atom economy (Anatas and Warner, 2000; Trost, 1995). The methanol accumulates in the medium provided that suitable methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibitors such as phosphate (Mehta et al., 1987), cyclopropanol (Sugimori et al., 1995), or a high concentration of NaCl (Lee et al., 2004) or CO2 (Xin et al., 2004) are added to the reaction system. In addition, sodium formate is generally added to supply NADH for methane oxidation as well as to prevent further oxidation of methanol (Perdeep et al., 1991).

{"chunk": "[Section: a b s t r a c t]\nMethanol was produced from methane with a high conversion rate using a high cell density process with Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b in the presence of a high concentration of phosphate buffer. More than 1.1 g/L methanol accumulated in the reaction media under optimized reaction conditions (17 g dry cell/L, 400 mmol/L phosphate, and 10 mmol/L MgCl2) in the presence of 20 mmol/L sodium formate. The conversion rate of methane was over 60%. About 0.95 g/L methanol was produced when the biotransformation was carried out in a membrane aerated reactor into which methane and oxygen were introduced via two separate dense silicone tubing. Our results provide an efficient method and a promising process for high-rate conversion of methane to methanol.\n\n/C211 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.\n\n67.0 mmol/L, respectively, produced a maximum amount of 152 mmol methanol/g of dry cell (corresponding to 5.3 mmol/L methanol).\n\nThemainchallengefaced in high yielding biocatalyzed processes for methanol production is further oxidation by MDH. Mehta et al. (1987)reportedthatphosphate-dependentinhibitionoffurtheroxidation is uncompetitive and reversible. Therefore, to achieve high methanol yields, increases in cell density should be accompanied by increasing concentrations of phosphate buffer to prevent further oxidation of methanol. To our knowledge, studies to test this have not been reported. This study aimed to achieve high yield methanol production using M. trichosporium OB3b whole cells. To this end, a high phosphate concentration was used to inhibit MDH at high cell densities.

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.3. Effects of MgCl2 and sodium formate on the accumulation of methanol]\nFormate and magnesium are known to have a considerable effect on soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) activity as well as on cell growth (Perdeep et al., 1991). The effects of MgCl2 and sodium formate concentration on methanol accumulation were therefore examined and the results are shown in Fig. 4. The optimal concentration of MgCl2 was found to be 10 mmol/L, when tested over the range 0-40 mmol/L. The methanol concentration reached 1.03 g/L after 50 h when the MgCl2 concentration was 10 mmol/L. This result corresponded to a methane-to-methanol conversion rate of 56%.\n\nTakeguchi et al. (1997) have reported that methanol accumulation increases with increasing sodium formate concentration, but no further increases where obtained above a sodium formate\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1.0\n\nMethanol accumulated/g/L\n\nReaction time/h\n\n0  mmol/L\n\n5  mmol/L\n\n10 mmol/L\n\n20 mmol/L\n\n40 mmol/L\n\n20\n\n50\n\nconcentration of 14.3 mmol/L. In the present study, the effect of formate on methanol accumulation at higher OB3b cell concentrations wasinvestigated. The kinetic curves measured for methanol production at various sodium formate concentrations (measured from 0 to 80 mmol/L) are shown in Fig. 5. It was found that 0.69 g/L methanol could be accumulated after 50 h in the presence of sodium formate at concentrations of between 10 and 80 mmol/L and the methaneto-methanol conversion rate was 41%. In addition, our results showed that methanol could be accumulated in the absence of sodium formate, although at lower concentrations than in the presenceofsodiumformate.Themaximummethanolconcentrationwas 0.58 g/L. Our results were therefore consistent with those reported by Takeguchi et al. As shown in Fig. 5, the kinetic curves measured at different sodium formate concentrations were different, although the maximum accumulation concentrations of methanol were almost identical. The methanol accumulation rate decreased with increasing formate concentration. Therefore, to maximize the accumulation rate of methanol, a low concentration of formate should be supplemented to the reaction mixture intermittently or continuously. This would be particularly important in continuous methane conversion processes with free or immobilized cells.\n\n0\n\n10\n\n20\n\n30\n\n40\n\n50\n\n0.0\n\n0.1\n\n0.2\n\n0.3\n\n0.4\n\n0.5\n\n0.6\n\n0.7\n\n0.8\n\nMethanol accumulated/g/L\n\nReaction time/h\n\n0  mmol/L\n\n10 mmol/L\n\n20 mmol/L\n\n40 mmol/L\n\n60 mmol/L\n\n80 mmol/L\n\nThe above results indicated that the optimal reaction conditions for methanol accumulation were 17.3 g dry cell/L, 400 mmol/L phosphate and 10 mmol/L MgCl2, with incubation at 30 /C176 C and pH 6.3 (the pH was optimized, results not shown), in the presence or absence of 20 mmol/L sodium formate. Results for this optimized process are shown in Fig. 6. The maximum methanol accumulated was 1.13 g/L after 40 h of reaction in the presence of 20 mmol/L sodium formate and the methane-to-methanol conversion rate was 64%. To our knowledge, the highest methanol accumulation reported previously is 0.25 g/L (7.7 mmol/L) (Lee et al., 2004). We therefore obtained an accumulation 4.5-fold greater than the previous best reported process.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/122", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l":
