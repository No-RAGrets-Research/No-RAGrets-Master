The  optimum cell-tocarrier ratio was determined to be 0.5 g cells/g  dry weight cellulose. Batch experiments  indicated that  100 m M   phosphate ion concentration was necessary  to inhibit further oxidation of methanol; excess oxygen supply favored methanol accumulation with an increase in methane conversion efficiency to 27%. A  pulse of  40  m M   sodium  formate  at the end of 6 h resulted in restoration of methanol accumulation by regenerating NADH2 required for the sustained activity of methane mono-oxygenase. Maximum methanol level of 50 pmol/mg cells was  obtained  in the batch  reactor.  In a standard 50-mL ultrafiltration continuous reactor, the covalently linked cells produced methanol at a continuous  rate of  100 pmol/h  for the first  10  h,  after  which the methanol accumulation rate fell low due to the depletion of NADH2  . The methanol accumulation could be stimulated by supplying sodium formate (40 mM) in either 20 or  100 m M   phosphate buffer.  Maximum methanol accumulation rate of 267 pmol/h was obtained when 20 mM  formate was supplied in the feed stream containing 100 m M   phosphate ions, and this level of biosynthesis was maintained for over 72 h. The stoichiometric  balance made at various  points of formate addition indicated that the molar amount of methanol generated at  steady  state  is dependent  on  the  equimolar addition of sodium formate to the feed. The half-life t1,2 and thermal denaturation rate constant K d were computed to be 108 h and 6.42  x h-',  respectively.\n\nKey words: Methylosinus trichosporium methanol biosynthesis immobilization batch and continuous studies", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/1", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 58.78, "t": 654.061, "r": 312.494, "b": 648.517, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/2", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 58.08, "t": 642.061, "r": 415.503, "b": 626.617, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/3", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 58.28, "t": 612.261, "r": 297.331, "b": 606.717, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/4", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 58.08, "t": 576.212, "r": 300.818, "b": 271.97900000000004, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/5", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 59.48, "t": 267.312, "r": 300.92, "b": 251.84699999999998, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "Methanol Biosynthesis by Covalently Immobilized Cells of Methy/osinus trichosporium; Batch and Continuous Studies", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "Perdeep K.

{"chunk": "[Section: Batch Data]\nThe immobilization of M. trichosporium whole cells by covalent  linking  to  glutaraldehyde  activated DEAEcellulose was  found  most  suitable for retaining  MMO activity compared to the other immobilization methods tried  in  our  laboratory such  as  physical adsorption  or entrapment. No extracellular methanol accumulated in the latter two methods. The effect of  changing the cellto-carrier  ratio  on  methanol  accumulation  and  cell leakage is shown in Figure 2. Maximum methanol accumulation rate  of  8.2  pmol/h  was  obtained  at  0.5 g cells/g  dry  weight  cellulose,  after  which  the  rate  fell sharply due to significant leakage of cells. The pH optimum was determined to be ranging from 6.2 to 6.6 in comparison to the reported value of  6.4 for free cells7 Hence, immobilized cells appeared to be less sensitive to a pH change in this range for optimum methanol accumulation. The temperature optimum was 35\"C, simi-\n\n0\n\n.o\n\n0.0\n\n0 . 2\n\n0.4\n\n0 . 6\n\n0. 8\n\n1.0\n\ng\n\ncell/g\n\nsupport\n\n9.0 -\n\naccumulated (Mmole/h)\n\n7.5-\n\n6.0\n\n4.5\n\nMethano!\n\n3.0-\n\n140\n\n-30\n\n-20\n\nLeakage of cells\n\n1.5-\n\n-10\n\nlar to that observed for free cells. The temperature data were replotted in the form of an Arrhenius plot to calculate  activation  energy (E,) for  free  and  immobilized cells (Fig. 3). The values of E, for free and immobilized cells were  computed to be  19,537 and  14,800 cal/mol, respectively. The optimum concentration of  phosphate ions required for inhibition of methanol oxidation activity was  100 mM, slightly higher than  that  required by the free cells (80 mM).7  Oxygen appeared to be the rate limiting substrate for methanol biosynthesis in immobilized  cell  preparations.  The replacement  of  air  with oxygen in batch cultures supported a total methanol accumulation rate  of  8.92 pmol/h  mg  cells, representing an  increase in  conversion  efficiency over  air  supplied cells from 10% to 27% (Table I). This value is threefold higher than that reported by HOU\"  for propylene oxide synthesis using M. trichosporium OB3b. An increase in oxygen concentration  was  seen  to result  in  decreased methane uptake rates. It has been reported  that under oxygen  excess (methane  limiting)  conditions,  the  enzyme  MMO  in M.  capsulatus and M. trichosporium OB3b switches from soluble to particulate form63l3  and may exhibit altered reaction specificities toward different substrates. This may be responsible for the observed phenomenon.\n\nThe synthesis of  methanol by  immobilized cells was at a constant rate of  8.75  pmol/h  mg cells for the first 2.5 h (Fig. 4), and the rate fell sharply after 6 h. In our earlier studies with  free cells, the fall in  the methanol accumulation  rate  was  attributed  to  depletion  of  the endogenous NADHz pool, and methanol accumulation rate was maximally stimulated by supplying 40 mM formate to the  reaction ves~e1.I~ With  immobilized cells, maximum stimulation in methanol accumulation rate to 8.6  ,umol/h  mg  cells occurred  on  addition  of  40  mM\n\n2.4\n\n2.0-\n\nh\n\nc\n\nE\n\n1.6-\n\nE\n\n3\n\n1.2\n\nE\n\na\n\n--.\n\ncn\n\n\\\n\nu\n\nw\n\n0\n\ncn\n\n0.8-\n\n-\n\n3.0\n\n3.1\n\n3.2\n\n3.3\n\n3.4\n\nI / T (\n\nOK-'\n\nx j o 3 )\n\n(a)\n\n-\n\n-\n\n\\\n\nq\n\n2.0\n\nE\n\n1.2\n\na\n\n-\n\nI\n\no.4\n\nt\n\n- 0 . 0\n\n3.0\n\n3.1\n\n3 . 2\n\n3.3\n\n3.4\n\n50\n\n4 0\n\n30\n\n20\n\nTemperature (\"C)\n\nT / T\n\n(OK-?\n\nx\n\n10-3\n\nI\n\n(b)\n\n0.4-\n\n40\n\n35\n\n30\n\nTemperature (°C)\n\n2.81\n\n1.6\n\n0.8-\n\nformate  at  the  sixth  hour  (Fig. 4). Total  extracellular methanol  levels of  up  to  50  pmol/mg  cells were  observed at  the end  of  12 h.  The in  situ regeneration of NADH2 has  been  demonstrated  earlier  by  supplying methane metabolites to free cells l5 and to immobilized cells.I2 In  spite o f   an  excess of  methane  and  formate detected in the reaction vessel, the rate of  methanol accumulation dropped sharply beyond  14 h. The reasons for this are not clear.\n\nThe MMO activity in  immobilized cell preparations stored at 4°C was studied over a period of  15 days. The specific MMO activity  of  54.2  pmol  methane  consumed/h mg cells (representing over 80% enzyme activity  of  freshly  harvested  cells,  i.e.,  66  pmol  methane oxidized/h mg cells) after 2 weeks storage was obtained only on addition of sodium formate to the reaction mixture.  Thus, NADH2 supply appeared to be  critical for MMO activity in the cells stored for a long period. The reported loss of MMO activity on storage3  at 4°C might be  due  to NADH2 loss rather  than  to MMO enzyme instability.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/65", "label": "text", "pages":

{"chunk": "[Section: Methanol Synthesis in a Continuous Reactor]\nThe covalently  linked  immobilized  cells  produced methanol at  a  constant rate of  100 pmol/h  in a 50-mL reactor containing 100 mg dry cell weight after attaining steady state (Fig. 5). This rate of  methanol biosynthesis continued  for  1 1   h  after  which  a  fall  in  the  rate  was observed.  Based  on  earlier  batch  studies, this was  attributed to depletion of intracellular NADH2 pool. The in vivo regeneration of NADH2 in the continuous reactor was carried out by supplying different concentrations of  sodium formate in 20 or 100 mM phosphate buffer, and  the  results  are  shown  in  Figure 5. A continuous feed of  20  mM sodium formate in  100 mM phosphate buffer  resulted in sustained methanol  accumulation of 267  pmol/h,  giving  a productivity of  5.34  mmol/h  L.

Loss  of nearly  90%  formate was  attributed  to  'the  further oxidation  of  methanol  by  partially  inactivated  methanol oxidation  activity at  100 mM phosphate levels. An interruption  in  formate  supply led  to a  fall  in  methanol\n\na Defined in Fig. 5.\n\naccumulation,  indicating the interdependence between the  two. A continuous feed  of  20  mM formate  in 100 mM phosphate buffer sustained continuous methanol  biosynthesis  up  to  70  h.  From  the  balance  made in  Table 11, it  can  be  concluded  that  molar  amounts of  methanol  synthesized  at  steady  state  is  driven  by NAD' + H2/NADH + H+  cycling in resting cells and is  dependent on equimolar addition of  NADH regenerating substrate.\n\nThe  dilution  rate D of  the  continuous  reactor  was varied from 0.2 to 1.0 h-'  (corresponding to a flow rate of  10-50 mL/h)  to  study  the  most  suitable  residence time  for  methanol  biosynthesis.  The  specific  product formation rate v and methanol production  as a function of  dilution  rate  are  shown  in  Figure 6.  A maximum specific product  formation  rate o f   25  pmol/h  mg cells and total  methanol  production  of  175.0  pmol  was  obtained  at a dilution  rate of 0.5 h-'.  Further increase in dilution  rate  resulted  in  a  sharp decline  in  methanol accumulation,  indicating  a  specific  contact  period  between cells and substrate for methanol biosynthesis.\n\nThe stability of  immobilized  microbial  cells  in  continuous  operation  was  studied  for  over  88 h  (Fig.  7). The leakage of  the cells and  microbial  contamination were  microscopically  examined  throughout  the operation.  The immobilized  preparation  was stable and did not disintegrate or lose cells. The slope in Figure 7 was used  to calculate  the half-life t 112 and the thermal  denaturation rate constant Kd. The computed values were 108 h and 6.42 x h-',  respectively.\n\n401\n\nT\"\n\nE\n\n--.\n\nL\n\n-.\n\nI\n\n20\n\nE\n\n-\n\n>\n\n10-\n\n/\n\n\\\n\n0.0\n\n0.2\n\n0-4\n\n0.6\n\nC B\n\n1.

{"chunk": "[Section: CONCLUSION]\nThe feasibility  of  using covalently linked cells of M. trichosporium for  continuous  biosynthesis  of  methanol from  methane  is  described.  While  the pH  and  temperature optima remain the same between free and immobilized  cells,  higher  phosphate  ion  concentration (100 mM) is required for maximum methanol biosynthesis  in  immobilized cells. Facilitated reaction  rates  are observed in immobilized cells as indicated by  lowered activation energy requirements, i.e.,  14,800 cal/mol  as against  19,537 cal/mol for free cells. In batch and continuous studies, the rate of methanol accumulation falls low after a certain initial period due to depletion of  the intracellular NADH2 pool. The reducing power  could be regenerated by  supply of  sodium formate in the feed stream to the reactor. Both phosphate ions and duration of   supply of  formate affect methanol biosynthesis in the continuous reactor. Although several reasons for the instability of  immobilized methanotrophs have been proposed,6 our  studies indicate  that  thermal  deactivation may  be  responsible for  slow  loss  of  enzyme  activity.\n\nWith  the  recent  cloning of  a  structural  gene  for  the r-subunit  of  protein A of   MMO (identified as the site of  hydrocarbon  oxidation) from M. cupsulutus into Escherichiu ~oli,~~,'* it  may  be  possible  to  develop highly selective  biochemical catalysts for controlled oxidation of  alkanes to alcohols.
