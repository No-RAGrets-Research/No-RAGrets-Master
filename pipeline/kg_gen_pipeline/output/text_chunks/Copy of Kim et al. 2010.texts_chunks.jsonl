{"chunk": "[Section: Optimization of Lab Scale Methanol Production by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b]\nHee Gon Kim, Gui Hwan Han, and Si Wouk Kim\n\nReceived: 4 February 2010 / Revised: 5 March 2010 / Accepted: 5 March 2010 © The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer 2010\n\nAbstract Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a methanotrophic bacterium containing particulate methane monooxygenase (MMO), which catalyzes the hydroxylation of methane to methanol. The methanol is further oxidized to formaldehyde  by  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH).  We developed a novel compulsory circulation diffusion system for  cell  cultivation.  A  methane/air  mixture  (1:1,  v/v)  was prepared in a tightly sealed gas reservoir and pumped into a nitrate mineral salt culture medium under optimal conditions (5 µM CuSO 4 , pH 7.0, 30°C). Cells were harvested, washed,  and  resuspended  (0.6  mg  dry  cells/mL)  in  a 500 mL  flask  in  100  mL  of  10  mM  phosphate  buffer (pH 7.0)  containing  100  mM  NaCl  and  1  mM  EDTA  as MDH inhibitors,  and  20  mM  sodium  formate.  A  single 12 h batch reaction at 25°C yielded a final concentration of 13.2 mM methanol. The use of a repeated batch mode, in which the accumulated methanol was removed after each of  three  8  h  cycles  over  a  24  h  period,  showed  a  productivity of 2.17 µ mol methanol/h/mg dry cell wt. Finally, a  lab-scale  reaction  performed  using  a  3  L  cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 1 L produced 13.7 mM methanol after 16 h. Our results identify a simple process for  improving  the  productivity  of  biologically  derived methanol and, therefore the utility of methane as an energy source.\n\nKeywords: methane monooxygenase, methanol dehydrogenase, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, NaCl, EDTA", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/3", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 59.52, "t": 622.881, "r": 281.126, "b": 613.581, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/4", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 59.52, "t": 560.495, "r": 363.1, "b": 540.855, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/5", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 59.52, "t": 504.561, "r": 297.92, "b": 190.25099999999998, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/6", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 59.522, "t": 174.34899999999993, "r": 297.842, "b": 152.14599999999996, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "Optimization of Lab Scale Methanol Production by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "Hee Gon Kim, Gui Hwan Han, and Si Wouk Kim\n\nReceived: 4 February 2010 / Revised:", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 80, "document_start": 92, "document_end": 172, "length": 80}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "5 March 2010 / Accepted:", "char_start": 81, "char_end": 105, "document_start": 173, "document_end": 197, "length": 24}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "5 March 2010 © The Korean Society for Biotechnology and Bioengineering and Springer 2010", "char_start": 106, "char_end": 196, "document_start": 198, "document_end": 288, "length": 88}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "Abstract Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a methanotrophic bacterium containing particulate methane monooxygenase (MMO), which catalyzes the hydroxylation of methane to methanol.", "char_start": 196, "char_end": 376, "document_start": 288, "document_end": 468, "length": 180}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "The methanol is further oxidized to formaldehyde  by  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH).", "char_start": 377, "char_end": 464, "document_start": 469, "document_end": 556, "length": 85}, {"sentence_id": 5, "text": "We developed a novel compulsory circulation diffusion system for  cell  cultivation.", "char_start": 464, "char_end": 550, "document_start": 556, "document_end": 642, "length": 84}, {"sentence_id": 6, "text": "A  methane/air  mixture  (1:1,  v/v)  was prepared in a tightly sealed gas reservoir and pumped into a nitrate mineral salt culture medium under optimal conditions (5 µM CuSO 4 , pH 7.0, 30°C).", "char_start": 550, "char_end": 743, "document_start": 642, "document_end": 835, "length": 193}, {"sentence_id": 7, "text": "Cells were harvested, washed,  and  resuspended  (0.6  mg  dry  cells/mL)  in  a 500 mL  flask  in  100  mL  of  10  mM  phosphate  buffer (pH 7.0)  containing  100  mM  NaCl  and  1  mM  EDTA  as MDH inhibitors,  and  20  mM  sodium  formate.", "char_start": 744, "char_end": 989, "document_start": 836, "document_end": 1081, "length": 243}, {"sentence_id": 8, "text": "A  single 12 h batch reaction at 25°C yielded a final concentration of 13.2 mM methanol.", "char_start": 989, "char_end": 1077, "document_start": 1081, "document_end": 1169, "length": 88}, {"sentence_id": 9, "text": "The use of a repeated batch mode, in which the accumulated methanol was removed after each of  three  8  h  cycles  over  a  24  h  period,  showed  a  productivity of 2.17 µ mol methanol/h/mg dry cell wt.", "char_start": 1078, "char_end": 1283, "document_start": 1170, "document_end": 1375, "length": 205}, {"sentence_id": 10, "text": "Finally, a  lab-scale  reaction  performed  using  a  3  L  cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 1 L produced 13.7 mM methanol after 16 h.", "char_start": 1284, "char_end": 1430, "document_start": 1376, "document_end": 1522, "length": 146}, {"sentence_id": 11, "text": "Our results identify a simple process for  improving  the  productivity  of  biologically  derived methanol and, therefore the utility of methane as an energy source.", "char_start": 1431, "char_end": 1599, "document_start": 1523, "document_end": 1691, "length": 166}, {"sentence_id": 12, "text": "Keywords: methane monooxygenase, methanol dehydrogenase, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, NaCl, EDTA", "char_start": 1599, "char_end": 1699, "document_start": 1691, "document_end": 1791, "length": 100}], "sentence_count": 13, "document_offsets": {"start": 0, "end": 1791}}
{"chunk": "[Section: 1. Introduction]\nThe  benefit  of  methane  as  an  energy  source  is  that  it produces  few  atmospheric  pollutants  and  generates  less carbon dioxide per unit energy than oil or coal. However, the use of methane is hindered by difficulties with storage and  transportation.  These  problems  can  be  solved  by  the conversion of methane to methanol. Methanol is used as a fuel for heat engines and fuel cells and can be converted by dehydration to  dimethyl ether (DME), a good diesel fuel with a higher octane rating than regular diesel fuel. Methanol is produced exclusively from methane, by processing syngas under conditions of high temperature and pressure. In  recent  years,  however,  investigators  have  explored  the biological  production  of  methanol  under  ambient  conditions.\n\nMethanotrophic  bacteria  are  able  to  grow  aerobically using methane as a sole source of carbon and energy. The first step in the metabolism of methane is its conversion to methanol by the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO, EC  1.14.13.25).  Methanol  is  converted  subsequently  to formaldehyde  by  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH,  EC 1.1.99.8), which is coupled to the electron transport chain at the level of cytochrome c L [1]. Formaldehyde is assimilated into biomass or oxidized to carbon dioxide, thereby providing  reducing  power  for  MMO.  The  production  of methanol using a methanotrophic bacterium requires  that oxidation of methanol be prevented, so that methanol can be excreted into the medium [2,3].\n\nIt  is  well  known  that  NaCl  inhibits  electrostatic  interaction  between  MDH  and  cytochrome c L [1].  We  have optimized methanol biosynthesis in M. trichosporium OB3b by  using  high  NaCl  concentrations  to  create  conditions inhibiting  MDH  activity,  while  retaining  MMO  activity [4].  The  high  salt  concentration  inhibits  the  transfer  of\n\nelectrons from MDH to cytochrome c L that occurs during the  oxidation  of  methanol,  resulting  in  the  excretion  of methanol  to  medium.  However,  at  concentrations  above 100 mM, NaCl significantly disrupts cell structure, including  the  slime  layer  and  the  intracytoplasmic  membrane (ICM),  where  particulate  MMO  (pMMO)  binds.  Dithiothreitol, phenylhydrazine, iodoacetate, cyclopropane, cyclopropanol,  and  EDTA  act  as  MDH  inhibitors  [1,5-7]. Among them, cyclopropanol is very difficult to be synthesized  chemically  and  maintain  its  stability  under  aerobic condition.  However,  EDTA  can  be  obtained  easily  and inhibits the activity of metalloprotein like MDH as a metal chelator. In this study, we have further improved methanol production  by  introducing  EDTA  as  an  MDH  inhibitor, allowing  us  to  reduce  the  concentration  of  NaCl  and  its deleterious  effects  on  cell  morphology.  In  addition,  we developed a repeated batch technique for the production of lab-scale batches of methanol.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/10", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 311.82, "t": 479.121, "r": 550.231, "b": 304.542, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/11", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 311.819, "t": 301.366, "r": 550.213, "b": 139.40800000000002, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/12", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 311.819, "t": 136.23299999999995, "r": 550.263, "b": 63.20399999999995, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/17", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 59.517, "t": 717.501, "r": 298.016, "b": 492.112, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "1.

Cells  were harvested in the middle stationary phase by centrifugation at 15,000 × g for 10 min, washed with 12.9 mM phosphate buffer  (pH  7.0,  standard  buffer),  and  resuspended  in  the same buffer. The cell density was adjusted to 0.6 mg dry cells/mL. The sample solution (100 mL), treated with 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 mM sodium formate, was introduced into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask with a screw cap. After the flask was incubated for 5 min at 25°C, the reaction  was  initiated  by  replacing  200  mL  of  air  in  the head-space of the flask with the same volume of methane/ air mixture (1:1, v/v).\n\nMethanol was also produced in a repeated batch mode in a  500  mL  flask.  In  this  process  methanol  was  removed periodically to prevent the accumulation of high concentrations,  which  can  retard  further  methanol  biosynthesis. After an 8 h reaction, 100 mL of the reaction mixture was centrifuged with sterilized tubes at 15,000 × g , to separate the  newly  produced  methanol  from  the  reaction  suspension.  In  the  following  reaction,  the  harvested  cells  were resuspended  in  the  12.9  mM  phosphate  buffer  and  introduced into the 500 mL flask. Thereafter, 20 mM sodium formate was included as a reducing agent for pMMO, and the  methane  mixture  was  introduced  to  the  flask.  The above procedure was repeated several times.\n\nLab-scale  methanol  production  was  designed  in  a  3  L reactor with 1 L working volume. The reaction was carried out in a compulsory circulation diffusion system consisting of cylindrical reactor (ø 110 × h 400 mm), portable rubber gas  bag,  mixed  gas  reservoir  containing  gas  bubbler  and silica-gel trap (Fig. 1). The 1 L reaction mixture contained 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium formate, and 0.6 mg dry cells/mL. A limited volume of fresh methane/ air mixture was introduced continuously from a rubber gas bag  into  the  gas  reservoir.  Thereafter  the  mixture  was forced by an air pump through micro pores prepared in the bottom  of  reactor  and  dispersed  evenly  in  the  reaction mixture.  Part  of  methane  mixture  in  the  reactor  was  fed back into the gas reservoir, mixed with fresh methane and re-circulated into the reactor, until fresh methane in the gas bag  was  consumed  completely.
