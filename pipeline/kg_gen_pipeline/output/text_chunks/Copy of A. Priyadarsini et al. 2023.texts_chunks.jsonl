{"chunk": "[Section: A B S T R A C T — Part 1]\nFast depletion of fossil fuels has triggered research in gas to liquid (GTL) technologies for synthesis of green transportation fuels. Utilization of natural gas pockets located in remote areas for methanol synthesis is a viable GTL  process.  This  study  has  examined  potential  of  microbial  consortium  enriched  from  rice  field  soil  for bioconversion of  methane to methanol. The presence of Type I methanotrophs was confirmed through PCR amplification  of  genomic  DNA  from  soil  using mmoY1 -mmoY2 primer set  which  is  specific  to Methylococcus capsulatus . Further, the methanol production profiling (without MDH inhibitors) revealed ~130 mM (4.16 g/L) methanol production from enriched consortium, which was close to 132.5 mM (4.24 g/L) methanol production by pure strain of Methylococcus capsulatus .  The  yield of  methanol for enriched consortium was 78.31 % and M. capsulatus was 79.81 %. These results show that enriched consortium holds high potential for BioGTL process for methanol synthesis.\n\nconsumable for the end-use (Wood et al., 2012). Thus, flaring causes wastage  of  enormous  amount  of  potential  energy  feedstock,  carbon monoxide emission and hazardous black carbon production by incomplete burning (Dong et al., 2017; Gvakharia et al., 2017), not to mention the fire hazards and accidents associated and reported at the oil mining and flaring sites due to human error (Brki ´ c and Praks, 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Mignan et al., 2022).\n\nOn industrial scale, methane (natural gas) is used as feedstock for production of  various  hydrocarbon  derivatives  using  Fischer-Tropsch process (Dry, 2002; Holditch, 2003; Jones et al., 2022). One of the derivatives is methanol (15.6 MJ/L) which has higher energy density than methane (36.6 × 10 GLYPH<0> 3 MJ/L).  As  a  liquid  fuel,  it  is  much  easier  to handle, easier to blend with gasoline, fits into current infrastructure and can be used as a feedstock for other chemical processes (Bromberg and Cheng,  2010;  Ge  et  al.,  2014a).  Methanol  is  also  produced  using methane by direct methane to methanol (DMTM) technique which is also  a  chemical  process  (Wang  et  al.,  2022b).  Both  Fischer-Tropsch process and DMTM process are chemical routes with very poor selectivity and low yields (Conrado and Gonzalez, 2014) for gas to liquid (GTL)  conversion  which  are  also  energy  intensive,  uneconomic  and\n\nA. Priyadarsini et al.\n\nenvironmentally unfriendly, given the source of feedstock is underrated (Adebajo and Frost, 2012; Park and Lee, 2013). To address these concerns significant amount of effort has been put into biological gas to liquid (BioGTL) conversion technology that are not energy intensive as the fermentations take place at ambient operating conditions of temperature  and  pressure,  relatively  cost  effective  and  cleaner  for  the environment than chemical routes (Conrado and Gonzalez, 2014; Haynes and Gonzalez, 2014). Biological methane to methanol conversion (bioconversion) is carried out by a set of organisms known as methanotrophs. These methane utilizers capture and metabolize methane as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth and metabolism using metabolic enzymes (Dong et al., 2017; Fei et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2014).\n\nMore  than  100  g-negative  and  strictly  aerobic  methane-utilizing bacteria  were  isolated  and  classified  by  Whittenbury  et  al.  (1970). They  extensively  described  the  enrichment,  isolation  and  culture methods. These methods have been modified over years and still form the  foundation  for  media  design  for  the  growth  of  methanotrophs. Methanotrophs are a subset of methylotrophic group of bacteria that can utilize  C1  hydrocarbons and their methylated derivatives. The methanotrophs are very specific in substrate requirements and can only grow on C1 hydrocarbons, i.e., methane and methanol (Hanson and Hanson, 1996). Methanotrophs are classified among three phyla such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and recently added phylum  NC10 (Hakobyan and Liesack, 2020). The phylum Proteobacteria is the largest among the phyla and is further subdivided into type I, type II and type X subgroups based on their metabolic pathway for carbon assimilation. Type  I  methanotrophs,  also  known  as  gammaproteobacteria,  utilize ribulose monophosphate pathway to assimilate carbon. Similarly, type II methanotrophs,  or  alphaproteobacteria,  use  serine  cycle  for  carbon fixation. Type X has a combination of both type I and II and can grow in higher temperatures (Colin Murrell and Radajewski, 2000; Hakobyan and Liesack, 2020; Hanson and Hanson, 1996; Whittenbury et al., 1970).", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/14", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 201.997, "t": 480.1829997695312, "r": 559.769, "b": 387.5449997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/15", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 306.594, "t": 354.9719997695312, "r": 560.022, "b": 284.9019997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/16", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 306.594, "t": 281.7819997695312, "r": 560.025, "b": 148.95499976953124, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/23", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 37.587, "t": 756.7059997695312, "r": 503.056, "b": 750.8579997695311, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/24", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 37.587, "t": 738.2169997695312, "r": 291.033, "b": 615.8209997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/25", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 37.587, "t": 612.7009997695312, "r": 291.032, "b": 406.6259997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "A B S T R A C T", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "Fast depletion of fossil fuels has triggered research in gas to liquid (GTL) technologies for synthesis of green transportation fuels.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 134, "document_start": 1960, "document_end": 2094, "length": 134}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "Utilization of natural gas pockets located in remote areas for methanol synthesis is a viable GTL  process.", "char_start": 135, "char_end": 244, "document_start": 2095, "document_end": 2204, "length": 107}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "This  study  has  examined  potential  of  microbial  consortium  enriched  from  rice  field  soil  for bioconversion of  methane to methanol.", "char_start": 244, "char_end": 387, "document_start": 2204, "document_end": 2347, "length": 143}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "The presence of Type I methanotrophs was confirmed through PCR amplification  of  genomic  DNA  from  soil  using mmoY1 -mmoY2 primer set  which  is  specific  to Methylococcus capsulatus .", "char_start": 388, "char_end": 577, "document_start": 2348, "document_end": 2537, "length": 189}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "Further, the methanol production profiling (without MDH inhibitors) revealed ~130 mM (4.16 g/L) methanol production from enriched consortium, which was close to 132.5 mM (4.24 g/L) methanol production by pure strain of Methylococcus capsulatus .", "char_start": 578, "char_end": 825, "document_start": 2538, "document_end": 2785, "length": 245}, {"sentence_id": 5, "text": "The  yield of  methanol for enriched consortium was 78.31 % and M. capsulatus was 79.81 %.", "char_start": 825, "char_end": 915, "document_start": 2785, "document_end": 2875, "length": 90}, {"sentence_id": 6, "text": "These results show that enriched consortium holds high potential for BioGTL process for methanol synthesis.", "char_start": 916, "char_end": 1025, "document_start": 2876, "document_end": 2985, "length": 107}, {"sentence_id": 7, "text": "consumable for the end-use (Wood et al., 2012).", "char_start": 1025, "char_end": 1072, "document_start": 2985, "document_end": 3032, "length": 47}, {"sentence_id": 8, "text": "Thus, flaring causes wastage  of  enormous  amount  of  potential  energy  feedstock,  carbon monoxide emission and hazardous black carbon production by incomplete burning (Dong et al., 2017;

{"chunk": "[Section: A B S T R A C T — Part 2]\nMajor  sources  of  methanotrophs  include  agricultural  rice  fields, natural gas fields, dairy and cattle industries, etc. They are ubiquitous and are almost present wherever methane exists. India is an agriculturebased country with abundant paddy cultivation. Paddy cultivation is one of the largest sources in the global budget of methane emissions (Wang et al., 2022a). It is interesting to note that majority of methane (90 %) emitted in the wetland rice fields comes from the vascular transport system within the rice plants instead of ebullition or diffusion through the rhizosphere. The rate at which methane is emitted is much less ( < 20 %) than the actual rate of production in the rice fields. The difference in the  rate  of  production  and  emission  can  be  explained  by  methane oxidation by the methanotrophs present in the oxic regions of the rice roots  and  rhizospheres  (Conrad  and  Rothfuss,  1991).  Thus,  they  are present in abundance in rice fields and they act as the main methane sink where they capture around 20 % of methane evolved due to decaying of water-logged  organic  matter  (Rahalkar  et  al.,  2021).  The  conversion efficiencies  of  transported  methane  by  methanotrophs  remain  in  the range of 70 -95 % in the soil-water interface (Epp and Chanton, 1993; Gilbert  and  Frenzel,  1995).  The  rice  field  rhizosphere  community comprises of type I and type II methanotrophs. However, very few have been successfully cultivated in situ due to various reasons like resistance to growth in laboratory formulated medium, lack of specific nutrient for growth, extremely strict association with heterotrophic satellite community, etc. (Pandit et al., 2016). In fact, no Type I methanotrophs had been isolated from rice rhizosphere, rice roots, bulk soil or floodwater and  only  their  presence  was  confirmed  using  molecular  techniques (Dianou et al., 2012; Pandit et al., 2016; Takeda et al., 2008). Several methanotrophs  with pmoA lineages  from  rice  paddy  cluster  (e.g., RPC1 -3)  have  been  detected  but  remain  uncultured  till  date  (Knief, 2015; Lüke et al., 2014). Only recently, Type Ia ( Methylomonas, Methylomicrobium,  and  Methylocucumis )  have  been  cultivated  and  isolated (Rahalkar et al., 2021). Methanol production capability of these methanotrophs is yet to be studied. Thus, rice field was chosen for this study since  they  are  a  breaming  source  of  methanotrophs  and  they  are commonly found across India.\n\nMethane is a very stable molecule and difficult to dissociate chemically. However, methane to methanol bioconversion is easily catalysed by a family of enzymes called the methane monooxygenases, i.e. particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and soluble methane monooxygenase  (sMMO),  depending  upon  the  location  of  the  enzymes. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) is a type X methanotroph that possesses both pMMO and sMMO enzymes (Khider et al., 2021). The presence of extracellular concentration of copper in the growth medium strongly influences the expression of each enzyme. The pMMO enzyme essentially requires copper (both Cu(I) and Cu(II)) for its catalytic activity whereas  sMMO  contains  iron  (Fe).  Thus,  pMMO  is  predominantly expressed when extracellular copper concentration is higher and alternatively, sMMO is expressed when extracellular copper concentration is low (Larsen and Karlsen, 2016; Lieven et al., 2018). The sMMO enzyme complex is made up of protein A, B and C. Protein A, the hydrolase constituent,  is  made  up  of  two  copies  of  three  subunitsα (coded  by mmoX ), β (coded by mmoY ) and γ (coded by mmoZ ). Protein B, coded by mmoB gene,  is  a  regulatory  protein  that  functions  as  the  effector  of electron transfer during catalytic reaction. Protein C is a reductase coded by mmoC gene (McDonald et al., 1995). The pMMO enzyme has three subunits called pmoA , pmoB and pmoC . Here, the pmoA and pmoC are the transmembrane subunits and pmoB has the soluble region which exhibits methane oxidation activity (Culpepper et al., 2012). In comparison to sMMO, not much has been understood about pMMO yet. Further studies are required to understand the structure, function and mechanism of each subunits and pMMO as a holoenzyme.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/26", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 37.587, "t": 403.4489997695312, "r": 291.036, "b": 50.93799976953119, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}, {"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 306.593, "t": 738.2169997695312, "r": 415.561, "b": 730.9059997695311, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/27", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 306.593, "t": 727.7289997695312, "r": 560.017, "b": 458.8949997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "A B S T R A C T", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "Major  sources  of  methanotrophs  include  agricultural  rice  fields, natural gas fields, dairy and cattle industries, etc.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 125, "document_start": 6687, "document_end": 6812, "length": 125}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "They are ubiquitous and are almost present wherever methane exists.", "char_start": 126, "char_end": 193, "document_start": 6813, "document_end": 6880, "length": 67}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "India is an agriculturebased country with abundant paddy cultivation.", "char_start": 194, "char_end": 263, "document_start": 6881, "document_end": 6950, "length": 69}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "Paddy cultivation is one of the largest sources in the global budget of methane emissions (Wang et al., 2022a).", "char_start": 264, "char_end": 375, "document_start": 6951, "document_end": 7062, "length": 111}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "It is interesting to note that majority of methane (90 %) emitted in the wetland rice fields comes from the vascular transport system within the rice plants instead of ebullition or diffusion through the rhizosphere.", "char_start": 376, "char_end": 592, "document_start": 7063, "document_end": 7279, "length": 216}, {"sentence_id": 5, "text": "The rate at which methane is emitted is much less ( < 20 %) than the actual rate of production in the rice fields.", "char_start": 593, "char_end": 707, "document_start": 7280, "document_end": 7394, "length": 114}, {"sentence_id": 6, "text": "The difference in the  rate  of  production  and  emission  can  be  explained  by  methane oxidation by the methanotrophs present in the oxic regions of the rice roots  and  rhizospheres  (Conrad  and  Rothfuss,  1991).", "char_start": 708, "char_end": 930, "document_start": 7395, "document_end": 7617, "length": 220}, {"sentence_id": 7, "text": "Thus,  they  are present in abundance in rice fields and they act as the main methane sink where they capture around 20 % of methane evolved due to decaying of water-logged  organic  matter  (Rahalkar  et  al.,  2021).", "char_start": 930, "char_end": 1150, "document_start": 7617, "document_end": 7837, "length": 218}, {"sentence_id": 8, "text": "The  conversion efficiencies  of  transported  methane  by  methanotrophs  remain  in  the range of 70 -95 % in the soil-water interface (Epp and Chanton, 1993;

{"chunk": "[Section: A B S T R A C T — Part 3]\nIndia has numerous natural gas reserves located in areas of difficult terrain  with  little  or  no  infrastructure  for  transportation  of  gas.  The motivation for this preliminary study was to address the natural gas wastage in remote and diffused sites by developing technology for on spot  utilization  of  natural  gas  pockets.  Several  studies  on  methanol production have been reported using pure strains (Duan et al., 2011; Ghaz-Jahanian  et  al.,  2018;  Patel  et  al.,  2016a,  2017,  2019,  2020d, 2023; Sahoo et al., 2023). A summary of literature on methanol production using methanotrophic bacteria is presented in Table 1. As can be referred from the table, most of the previous studies have employed single isolated strains of methanotroph for methanol production. However, very few studies have used mixed cultures with methanol titre of 1.49 g/g (Han et al., 2013), 28.13 mM (Sheets et al., 2017) and 15.16 mM (AlSayed et  al.,  2018).  In  addition,  no  previous  study  has  used methanotrophic consortium enriched specifically from rice field soil for methanol  production.  Although  the  basic  concept  of  conversion  of methane to methanol has been previously reported in literature, several practical constraints and hurdles have to be overcome to convert the basic  concept  into  a  viable  solution.  One  major  hurdle  is  the  use  of natural isolates (such as consortia enriched from natural source of rice fields) which are robust and stable for large scale operation.\n\nThe main objectives of this preliminary study include (i) detection and enrichment of methanotrophic bacteria from rice field soil community, (ii) methanol production using enriched microbial consortium. As  already  discussed,  rice  fields  are  a  substantial  source  of  massive methanotrophic communities. Unfortunately, not all the bacterial species are culturable. So, early and easy detection tools can help in understanding,  strategizing  and  refining  the  enrichment  and  isolation process.

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.1. Preamble: enrichment of rice field soil cultures]\nIsolation  of  methanotrophic  bacteria  is  a  time-consuming  and tedious process. The methanotrophs are strongly associated with heterotrophic  satellites  around  them  in  their  community  (Dedysh  and Dunfield, 2011). So, the initial growth is often attributed to the growth of satellite bacteria growing on products from methanotrophic bacteria. The bacterial growth was observed in the enrichment cultures after 3 days which could be identified by increase in the turbidity of the cultures. Since, the growth was also observed in control experiments within 3 days, which were not fed with methane, it can be inferred that initial growth attributes to the heterotrophic community and not the methanotrophs.  However, methanotrophic bacteria have been reported to grow in 4 -5 days from inoculation. Pure cultures are isolated bacteria that help in study of single species. In contrast, use of enriched culture has  economic  and  practical  advantage  over  pure  cultures.  Microbial consortium has more tolerance to potential contaminants in the feed gas (Jiang et al., 2023). So, the cost associated with the purification of feed gas  for  fermentation  can  be  significantly  reduced.  This  shows  that methanotrophic bacteria has better adaptability and applicability  towards changing environment while growing in a community (Han et al., 2013). Moreover, isolation of pure strains needs longer incubation time period and multiple transfers rendering the entire process not only unreliable and extremely challenging but also time consuming; further, it requires expertise to avoid contaminations in between  transfers\n\n(Kulkarni et al., 2022). On the contrary, consortial cultures are reliable, easier to culture and have above mentioned advantages over pure cultures  in  fermentations.

{"chunk": "[Section: 4. Discussion]\nMethanotrophs efficiently convert methane to methanol in a single step using methane monooxygenase enzymes at ambient reaction conditions.  The  production  of  methanol  occurs  intracellularly  by  both pMMO  and  sMMO.  Extracellular  methanol  accumulation  is  usually achieved by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibition (Patel et al., 2016c).  In  this  study,  methanol  production  was  achieved  without addition of MDH inhibitors. The samples from initial culture and fifth day  enriched  cultures  were  taken  and  examined  for  the  presence  of methanol using gas chromatography. The methanol production in the pure strains of M. capsulatus and M. buryatense were also examined after 5 days of incubation (Fig. 2). It is very interesting to note here that these results are consistent with the gene detection results. The presence of bacteria in rice field soil similar to M. capsulatus (confirmed by PCR gene amplification) shows similar methanol production as well. The maximum methanol production reported in previous literature was 50 mM (1.6 g/L) by Strain AS1 isolated from active anaerobic sludge grown under 50 % methane at 28 ◦ C in an external loop airlift bioreactor where the airlift reactor was constantly supplied with methane enriched NMS medium  (Ghaz-Jahanian  et  al.,  2018).  Recently,  a  methanol  titre  of\n\n61.88  mM  was  achieved  a  customized  airlift  with  a  draft  tube  and microsparger  using Methylosinus  trichosporium NCIMB  11131.  The design of the bioreactor and use of methane vector enhanced the volumetric mass transfer rate of methane resulting in a high methanol titre (Sahoo et al., 2023). The highest methanol titre reported so far is 64.6 mM that has been achieved by using co-culture of Metholosinus sporium and Methylocystis bryophila and a feed gas composition of methane (30 %) and hydrogen (5 -20 %) that was derived from anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation of rice straw (Patel et al., 2023).
