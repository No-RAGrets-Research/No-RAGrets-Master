{"chunk": "[Section: Introduction — Part 1]\nGas chromatographic (GC) methodologies have been reported, being the volatile fraction analysed by diversified techniques (1-5). Chronologically, the direct sample injection in packed columns (1,3) became obsolete and was gradually substituted by headspace techniques in capillary columns (6) and, more recently, by the selective headspace injection using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers (5,7,8). However, both headspace methodologies require an accurate time- and temperature-controlled sample heating. When the automatic injectors are not available, reproducibility problems are difficult to overcome. Moreover, the influence of the biological specimen on the partitioning of the volatile compounds between liquid and headspace vapour and the selectivity of the SPME fibres increase both the complexity of method develop-\n\nment and the total analysis time (9). In addition, the headspace techniques usually require larger sample volumes and have higher detection limits.\n\nEthanol, acetaldehyde, methanol, and acetone are volatile compounds whose detection and quantification in biological matrices can be used as biomarkers of several diseases and/or intoxications.\n\nEthanol consumption is under strict regulations in many circumstances, and legal blood alcohol concentration limits for driving are well established. Over-consumption of alcoholic beverages and drunkenness are almost always closely related with fatal accidents, trauma deaths, drowning, suicide, and violent crimes (10). These considerations justify the importance of the determination of ethanol levels in ante-mortem and post-mortem specimens with great importance in the forensic domain (4).\n\nHumans are frequently exposed to naturally occurring acetaldehyde that can exist in the air and that can be ingested as a contaminant of food and alcoholic drinks because it is the main compound formed during ethanol metabolism. Additionally, humans are also exposed to acetaldehyde coming from automobile exhaust, cigarette smoke, fireplaces, and occupational settings. This compound has been associated with cancer development in animal experiments, and has been classified as a possible carcinogenic agent to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (11). Thus, from a clinical point of view, its quantification in biological samples is of paramount importance.\n\nThe quantification of methanol in body fluids is very important for confirmation of methanol intoxication-related deaths (12). The quantification of methanol in biological fluids can also be a biomarker of intentional (13), accidental (for example, by ingestion in adulterated drinks) (14), or occupational exposure (15).\n\nAcetone can be a biomarker of ketoacidosis, which can help to diagnose ante-mortem diabetes mellitus, though it can also be a likely cause of death in binge drinkers and alcoholics (16), and can be very useful in the diagnosis of death from hypothermia (17). Ketoacidosis is diagnosed by analysis of high levels of ketone bodies in body fluids, namely acetone, acetoacetate, and particularly β -hydroxybutyrate (18). Additionally, the quantification of acetone in biological fluids can be a biomarker of occupational exposure (15).\n\n0.00\n\n0.00\n\n1.18\n\n1.16\n\nConcentrated solutions\n\nPrepared in deionised water and containing\n\n500 g/L Ethanol\n\nGiven the importance of the quantitation of these compounds in blood and urine from ante-mortem and post-mortem specimens, we validated the present method in these matrices. However, as post-mortem compound levels in blood do not necessarily reflect the concentration at the time of death, due to drug instability and post-mortem redistribution phenomena (19), measurements of vitreous humour (VH) concentrations could be of interest for predicting the blood concentration at the time of death in humans (20). VH is a very useful matrix because the vitreous fluid is less influenced by autolytic processes, is simple to collect, and is not affected by hemolysis (10). Additionally, it is a clean fluid that contains less protein than urine and exhibits high stability (21). Thus, VH has been recently demonstrated to be a suitable alternative specimen to post-mortem blood and urine, not only for the analysis of ethanol intoxications, but also for other drugs as well as endogenous biochemical constituents of the body to detect ante-mortem diseases (10). VH is, additionally, more resistant to putrefactive changes than other specimens, such as blood (8,22). Due to these advantages, VH determinations have formerly been performed in order to detect various drugs, in particular ethanol (10) as well as morphine (23), cocaine (24), and amitriptyline (25).\n\nThe validation of this method for its application in cell culture medium (CCM) samples is also important due to the need of controlling the levels of these compounds when a cell culture is used to study their effects on cell physiology and toxicity (26).", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/8", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 57.004, "t": 256.846, "r":

The injection port of the chromatograph was installed with a glass liner (5-mm i.d.) appropriated for split analysis, to prevent the contamination of the GC column with non-volatile material from the tested matrices. For B and VH, the liner was replaced after 50 injections. For CCM and for U, the liner was replaced after 100 injections.\n\nThe analyses were performed under the following chromatographic conditions: Column, CPWax 57 CB (WCOT Fused Silica), 25 m × 0.25 mm i.d., DF = 0.2 µm, from Varian (Palo Alto, CA). The temperature of the FID was 220ºC, and the injector temperature was 220°C. The oven temperature was programmed to 40°C (for 2 min), followed by an increase of\n\n5ºC/min until 200ºC. The carrier gas was helium with a flow of 1.5 mL/min.

{"chunk": "[Section: Conclusion]\nIn conclusion, the direct GC-FID injection method using capillary columns presented here is a highly sensitive, rapid, and reliable procedure to determine a plethora of volatile compounds in various biological samples. For the first time, a method was validated for the simultaneous determination of acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol, and ethanol in four different matrices (human B, U, VH, and CCM). The small amounts of sample injected (0.5 µL) and the high split ratios applied (1:60 and 1:100), allied to the high performance of the GC column, result in very good peak resolution and high sensitivities.
