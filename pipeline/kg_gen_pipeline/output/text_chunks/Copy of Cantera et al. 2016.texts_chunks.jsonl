This study assessed the in /uniFB02 uence of Cu 2 þ and CH4 concentration and the effective CH4 supply rate during culture enrichment on the structure and biodegradation kinetics of methanotrophic communities. The results obtained demonstrated that an increase in Cu 2 þ concentration from 0.05 to 25 m M increased the qmax and Ks of the communities enriched by a factor of z 3, even if the Cu 2 þ concentration did not seem to have an effect on the enzymatic ' copper switch ' and only pMMO was detected. In addition, high Cu 2 þ concentrations supported lower diversity coef /uniFB01 cients (Hs z 1.5 /C2 lower) and apparently promoted the growth of more adapted methanotrophs such as Methylomonas . Despite no clear effect of CH4 concentration on the population structure or on the biodegradation kinetics of the communities enriched was recorded at the two low CH4 concentrations studied (1 and 8%), a higher agitation rate increased the qmax by a factor of z 2.3 and Ks by a factor of z 3.1.\n\n© 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although emissions with CH4 concentrations above 20% are suitable for energy recovery by incineration or low-cost treatment by /uniFB02 aring, more than 50% of anthropogenic emissions contain CH4 at concentrations below 3% (old land /uniFB01 lls (0 e 20%), ventilated coal mines (0.1 e 1%), covered liquid manure storage tanks (0 e 3%), etc.) (Nikiema et al., 2007; Scheutz et al., 2009). CH4 abatement at such low concentrations using conventional physical/chemical technologies is either inef /uniFB01 -cient or too costly, and often entails a large CO2 footprint (Estrada et al., 2014; Nikiema et al., 2007). In this context, biological treatment technologies can become, if appropriately optimized, a lowcost and environmentally friendly alternative for the treatment of CH4 due to their already proven effectiveness and low operating costs during the abatement of malodors and volatile organic compound emissions (L /C19 opez et al., 2013).\n\nHowever, the cost-effective implementation of current biotechnologies for the treatment of CH4 is still limited by the understanding of the communities underlying CH4 biodegradation (Li et al., 2014; L /C19 opez et al., 2013).

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.1. Microbial population diversity and community pro /uniFB01 le]\nThis study demonstrated the key role of Cu 2 þ concentration on the diversity and bacterial composition during the enrichment of CH4 degrading microbial communities. CH4 concentration did not entail signi /uniFB01 cant differences on either the microbial diversity or community structure. The Shannon e Wiener diversity index revealed that low Cu 2 þ concentrations at similar CH4 supply rates resulted in a higher diversity. This result was mainly due to a negative effect of high Cu 2 þ concentrations in some of the ecosystem communities.\n\nThe analysis of the Pearson similarity coef /uniFB01 cients and the phylogenetic trees also con /uniFB01 rmed that the enriched methanotrophic bacteria shifted differently depending on the Cu 2 þ concentration. While Methylomonas , Methylobacter and Methylomicrobium were always present in all enrichments, a clear in /uniFB02 uence of Cu 2 þ concentration on the relative abundance and dominance of these species was observed. This was more evident in Methylomonas , which became dominant in the presence of high Cu 2 þ concentrations and outcompeted other microorganisms. Indeed, this genus was present at different positions in the DGGE gel and the phylogenetic tree, thus representing either different species of Methylomonas or distinct fragments of the same rich species. This /uniFB01 ngerprint pattern was comparable with that obtained in batch bioreactor cultures operated at low CH4 concentrations, where Methylomonas became the dominant microorganism when Cu 2 þ concentration was increased by a factor of 10 (Estrada et al., 2014; Van Der Ha et al., 2013).\n\nOn the contrary, the DGGE pro /uniFB01 les of the communities enriched under the 8 conditions tested showed that both Cu 2 þ concentration and the cross effect of CH4 and Cu 2 þ concentration exhibited a minor impact on the structure of the associated heterotrophs. In this sense, the genus Bdellovibrio was the single identi /uniFB01 ed genus associated to a low copper concentration at 300 rpm. Interestingly, other authors have found using stable isotope probing (SIP) that Bdellovibrio is labeled in methanotrophic enrichments, suggesting that these might be parasites or predators of methanotrophs (McDonald et al., 2005; Semrau et al., 2010). In this regard, the high Cu 2 þ concentration used could have been toxic for Bdellovibrio , which suggest that the addition of Cu 2 þ could be used as a potential predator-parasite control strategy. Despite previous studies suggested that changes on Cu 2 þ concentration can induce a positive effect on the dominant species, to the best of our knowledge no clear in /uniFB02 uence of Cu 2 þ on the main bacterial communities and on the microbial diversity was reported to date. This is probably due to the narrow range of concentrations tested in environmental studies simulating natural soils but not taking into account the possible biostimulation effect derived from the addition of copper in land /uniFB01 ll cover soils (Estrada et al., 2014; Ho et al., 2013; Nikiema et al., 2013).\n\nThe effective CH4 supply rate was determined by the agitation rate set under similar CH4 headspace concentrations, the lower stirring rates supporting a limited transfer of CH4 to the microbial community. The agitation rate exhibited a strong in /uniFB02 uence not only on the structure of the methanotrophic community ( Methylomonas presence was signi /uniFB01 cantly higher at 650 than at 300 rpm) but also on that of the associated heterotrophic population, which can play a key role on CH4 oxidation by avoiding a metabolite-mediated inhibition of MB or by excreting substances that stimulate MB activity (Hrsak and Begonja, 2000; Van Der Ha et al., 2013). The diversity of associated heterotrophs was higher at 300 rpm. In this context,\n\nDokdonella (bands 12 e 13) and Bdellovibrio (bands 2 e 3), two heterotrophs belonging to the Proteobacteria phylum that have been retrieved in bioreactors treating waste gases (Kallistova et al., 2014; Lebrero et al., 2013), were detected. In addition, the phylum Chlamydiae , typically found in bioreactors inoculated with aerobic activated sludge, was present under low agitation rates (Estrada et al., 2014).

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.2. Methane monoxygenase]\nCopper is one of the most important factors controlling the relative expression of the two forms of monooxygenases in methanotrophs, sMMO and pMMO, and therefore in /uniFB02 uences the type of MB enriched (Murrel et al., 2000; Semrau et al., 2010). Previous enzymatic assays have shown that sMMO is synthesized at low Cu 2 þ concentrations (below 0.8 m M (Semrau et al., 2010)), while pmoA is always expressed at a signi /uniFB01 cant level regardless of the Cu 2 þ concentration and such expression increases at increasing copper concentrations (Hakemian and Rosenzweig, 2007; Murrel et al., 2000). However, other studies assessing the in /uniFB02 uence of copper on MB structure and MMO expression in natural ecosystems did not observe sMMO or type II MB at concentrations as low as 0.1 m M(Chen et al., 2007; Ho et al., 2013; Semrau et al., 2010). Thus, the mechanisms governing both the environmental distribution of both enzymes and the cross-effect of multiple parameters on the type of methanotrophs enriched or the enzyme expression are still unclear. In fact, additional factors such as the inorganic nitrogen concentration have been claimed to determine the type of methanotroph enriched. For example, Type II methanotrophs are often dominant in environments exposed at high CH4 concentrations and low inorganic nitrogen levels, due to their nitrogen /uniFB01 xing ability (Graham et al., 1993; Li et al., 2014; L /C19 opez et al., 2013). In this study, the high concentration of nitrogen (62 m М ) together with the low CH4 concentrations ( < 8%) treated could explain the enrichment of type I methanotrophs.\n\nOn the other hand, the presence of both mmoX and pmoA genes in the inoculum con /uniFB01 rmed that both enzymes were initially present, which suggests that the three types of methanotrophs were present in the inoculum but were gradually overcame by type I MB (Fig. 3A), with only the type X Methylococcus being detected at high CH4 and low Cu 2 þ concentrations. pMMO was thus the main enzyme present in the cultures enriched, even at lower Cu 2 þ concentrations than the thresholds set by previous enzymatic studies (Hanson and Hanson,1996; Murrel et al., 2000; Semrau et al., 2010). This /uniFB01 nding could be due to the presence of a Cu þ 2 uptake mechanism, such as that driven by methanobactin, that sensed and concentrated Cu 2 þ , thus supporting the correct activity of pMMO (Kalidass et al., 2015; Semrau et al., 2010). At this point it should be noted that despite some research provided insight into the role of copper using enzymatic and biochemistry studies, real scale operation is far more complex and requires the elucidation of the role of Cu 2 þ on the enzyme expression in natural mixed cultures.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/266", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 301.832, "t": 580.2139887695313, "r": 552.957, "b": 321.69598876953125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/267", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 301.832, "t": 318.6899887695312, "r": 552.946, "b": 143.26198876953117, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "4.2.
