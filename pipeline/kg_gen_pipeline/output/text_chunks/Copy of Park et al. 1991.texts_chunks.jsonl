The optimal conditions  for cell growth and production  o f   the soluble form o f   MMO (sMMO) were determined from  batch  cultivations o f   an  obligatory  methanotroph, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b,  in  shake flasks and  a 5-L bioreactor. It   was confirmed that a copper deficiency i s essential for the formation o f   the cytoplasmic sMMO.  Optimum cell  growth without added  copper was observed at pH 6.0- 7 0 , temperature o f   30-34\"C,  and phosphate concentration o f   10-40  mM.

In some methanotrophs such as Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b  and Methylococcus  capsulatus (Bath), the  MMO  enzyme  is  known  to be  associated with either a membrane-bound (particulate) fraction or as  a  cytoplasmic (soluble) protein  complex, depending on the growth  condition^.^^^^'^^ While the soluble MMO (sMMO) enzyme system has been purified and studied in  some  detail  during  the  past  five   year^,^^\"^,^^  the growth  characteristics  of  microorganisms  producing this enzyme have not been investigated and discussed in much detail. Harwood and Pirt examined the growth of M. capsulatus (Bath) and provided some basic information which is helpful in assessing the economic feasibility of  producing microbial protein from natural gas.13 They studied  the  effects  of  nutrient  composition and several operational conditions, but did not address the production of  MMO. The effect of  oxygen tension on methylotrophic  bacteria  was  examined  by  Dalton's gro~p~','~ and  Maclennan  et  a1.20. In M. capsulatus (Bath), Dalton  et  al. noted that  a high  oxygen tension above a pOz of  0.1  atm inhibited  nitrogen assimilation and reduced the growth rate under nitrate- or ammonium-limiting conditions. Maclennan et al. observed that increasing the oxygen 'ension  decreased the cell yield, but it increased C02 production during the continuous culturing of Pseudomonas AM1 on methanol.\n\nEstablishment of  the precise culture conditions governing the  intracellular  location or form of  the MMO enzyme has  been  a  conflicting,  but  important  issue. Scott et aL3' reported that M. trichosporium OB3b generated  the  particulate  form of  MMO  (pMMO) during oxygen-limited,  nitrate-excess  chemostat  culturing. However, Dalton's group reported  that  the enzyme lo-\n\ncation  in M. capsulatus (Bath) and M. trichosporium OB3b was determined by copper availability in the culture  medium:  MMO  activity was  found  in  the  membrane fraction when adequate copper was added, and in the  soluble fraction  when  copper  availability became limited.31  They  also suggested that  the  conditions  described by  Scott et al.30  masked the underlying copper effect.

{"chunk": "[Section: Microorganism and Culture Conditions]\nMethylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  obtained  from Professor R. S. Hanson (Gray Freshwater Biological Institute, University of  Minnesota) was used in all experiments.  It  was  maintained  on  1.7%  agar  plates  of Higgins  nitrate  minimal  salt  medium6 at  30°C  (see Table I). The agar plates were cultured and stored several weeks in a gas-tight  jar under a 1 : 1  (v/v) methane/air gas mixture. For long term storage, glycerol was added at  20%  (w/v)  to  the  fully  grown  shake-flask  cultures and the mixture was maintained at  -60°C.\n\nThe basal culture medium used for both the shakeflask and the bioreactor experiments was the same nitrate  minimal  salt  medium  cited  above, but  it  lacked CuS04. It  was  prepared  from  four  separate  concentrated  stock solutions  as  described  in  Table  I,  except that CuS04  was deleted from solution 3. Cellulose acetate (0.22 pm) membranes, 50-mm-diameter disposable filter unit from Corning Glass Works (Corning NY) or a  142-mm-diameter 316  stainless-steel filter  apparatus from Millipore Corp., were used for sterilizing all of the liquid solutions. For the bioreactor experiments which involved the continuous supply of  an air/C02  gas mixture (see below), the fully constituted  culture medium was sparged and saturated with this gas mixture for at least  6 h  (along with  automatic pH adjustment to 7.0) prior to the inoculations.\n\nFlask  experiments  were  performed  at  30°C  (unless stated otherwise) in  a gyratory incubator (model G24, New Brunswick Scientific Co., New Brunswick, NJ) at\n\na Culture medium was made up as follows: Appropriate aliquots of concentrated solutions 1-3  were added to the desired volume of double distilled water and the combined diluted mixture was sterilized by passage through a 0.22-pm membrane filter. Separate and freshly prepared sterile iron solution 4 was then added aseptically to  this  mixture.  Higgins  standard nitrate  minimal medium contains Cu at a final concentration of  1.0 pM.\n\nEach stock solution was stored at 4°C after sterilization, except for the phosphate buffer which was stored at room temperature.\n\na shaking speed of 300 rpm. Shake flasks (300 mL) having a 19-mm (0.d.) sidearm tube (Wheaton Instruments) were employed to read the absorbance directly without removing samples during  the  cultivation.  The  liquid working volume was 20 mL. The small screw cap opening on the flask was used for introducing the methane/ air  mixture.  It  was  sealed  with  an  open-top-closure screw cap and a PTFE-faced red rubber septum (Kimble Glass Inc.). The large opening on the flask was used for  adding culture  medium  and  the  inoculum.  It  was plugged with a sponge stopper during autoclaving, but was subsequently sealed tightly during  the  cultivation with  the  rubber-lined  plastic  screw cap that was  supplied with the flask. Before starting a new flask incubation,  a  1 : 1 (v/v)  methane/air  gas mixture was bubbled into the inoculated culture medium for 5 min at a flow rate of  270 mL/min.  It was added through a sterile intraveneous placement unit consisting of  a needle and a long catheter (Delmed, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). The methane  and  air  were  measured  and  mixed  with  a Matheson gas proportioner (model 7300, Matheson Gas Products, Syracuse, NJ) and sterilized through a 0.22pm disposable filter unit (Corning Glass Works) before the gas mixture passed into the flasks. Generally, during flask culturing the gas phase was either not replenished or else it was replaced one time after 48 h. When\n\na longer growth period was desired, it was replenished every 24 h.\n\nFermentor-scale  experiments were  performed  in  a 5-L bioreactor  (Bioflo  11,  New  Brunswick  Scientific Co.) with  a continuous flow of  gases.

{"chunk": "[Section: MMO Activity in the Cell-Free Systems — Part 1]\nCells from shake flasks were harvested by  centrifugation (104g,  10 min, 4\"C),  washed once in ice-cold 25 mM MOPS  buffer,  pH  7.0,  containing  5  mM MgC12, and resuspended in the same buffer to give ca. 25 mg  dry cell  wt/mL.  Bovine  pancreas  deoxyribonuclease  I (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added to give a concentration of  10 pg/mL.  Cells in suspension at 4°C were then broken by  a single pass through a French pressure cell (SLM Instruments,  Inc.,  IL) at  15,000 lb/in.' and  the unbroken cells were removed by  centrifugation at  104g for  10 in, 4°C. The resulting cell-free extract was further centrifuged two successive times at 3.8 x 104g  for 30 min, yielding a supernatant (S38) and an initialparticulate  (P38 combined sediment) fraction. In order to remove  probable  contamination  from  entrapped  S38, the initial  P38 fraction was washed, recentrifuged one additional time in the same cold buffer, and again resuspended to  give  the  final  P38  membrane material.\n\nmost constant throughout  the cultivation, except for a decreasing trend near the end of  the batch operation. It is worth noting that there was no appreciable change in sMMO activity at around 50-60 h, i.e., before and after the large shift in the growth rate. Under these culture conditions  the  level  of  sMMO  catalysis  and,  presumably, the rate of methane assimilation are not proportional  to  the  bacterial  growth  rate.  A  biphasic growth curve and the nonvarying sMMO activity have not  been  addressed in  the past,  but  they  may  explain why  the reported  values for the methane  consumption efficiency (defined as g dry cell wt produced/g methane consumed) of M. trichosporiurn OB3b and several other methanotrophs  are  not  consistent  and  vary  widely.'*16 Figure 5 also shows that the decrease of the growth rate coincided with the depletion of  culture medium nitrate at 50-60 h.  This  indicated  that  the  transition  might be induced by a switch of  the nitrogen source from nitrate  to  the  gaseous nitrogen  that  is  carried  into  the bioreactor as part  of  the 9:l air/C02  mixture.  It  has been  established that M. trichosporium OB3b can  fix gaseous nitrogen  through  a  nitrogenase  which  is  inducible  under  either  nitrate-  or  ammonium-limiting culture conditions.394\n\nThe effect of  nitrate on the cell growth and the transition in the growth rate was investigated further: first, by  varying its  concentration  in  the bioreactor  culture medium,  and  next,  by  transferring  bioreactor  cells growing in two different growth phases into fresh culture  media.  Figure 6 shows the cell  densities  both at  the  transitions (X,) and  at  the  ends  of  the  batch cultures as a function of the initial medium nitrate concentration. Parameter X, was determined by extrapolating the straight lines during both growth phases. When the  nitrate  concentration  was  varied  over  the  range from 5 to 20 mM, X, increased with  increasing nitrate although the  final  cell  densities were  practically constant.  Cell  yield  on  nitrate  was  determined  from  the slope in Figure 6 to be 100 g dry cell wt/mol  nitrate or 7.14 g dry cell wt/g  N. It is in close agreement with the theoretical value estimated from elemental analyses of various methanotrophs.'  At a much higher nitrate concentration (40 mM), however,  the  exponential  fast growth rate began to decrease well before most of  the nitrate was consumed and the proportionality shown in Figure 6 did not extent to this higher nitrate concentration (data not shown). Figure 7 shows the results of the culture transfer  experiments.  Microorganisms growing in the bioreactor  were transferred at two separate times into shake flasks containing fresh media with either no added  nitrate  or  10  m M  nitrate.  When  fast  growing early  stage bioreactor  cells were  transferred  into  the fresh nitrate-containing medium at 20 h, they exhibited the same rapid growth rate. Similarly, when slow growing late-stage bioreactor cells were transferred at 150 h, nitrate quickly restored most of  their earlier fast growth rate.  But  when  nitrate-free  medium  was  used,  the\n\nr\n\n3.0\n\nI\n\n0\n\nt\n\no\n\n0\n\n5---------- 5 - .\n\n--------\n\n-i\n\n0\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\nNitrate (mM)\n\nTransition cell density (g dry wt/L) (o)\n\n(0)\n\n2.5\n\nFinal culture cell density (g dry wt/L)\n\n2.0 -\n\n1.5 -\n\n1.0\n\n0.5\n\nY\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n80\n\n100\n\nTime (hr)\n\n10 F\n\nB\n\nAbsorbance 660 nm\n\n(19mm side-arm flask, Spectronic 21)\n\n1 H\n\n#=0.085 hr 1\n\nH=0.053 hr 1\n\n10--e-0\n\nu=0.013 hr1\n\n01\n\ngrowth rate was slow regardless of the prior growth rate in  the  bioreactor.

In the pH 6.0-7.0 region, there was essentially no difference in growth rate. But above pH 7.5, an increased lag  time was observed  and  the growth  rate  decreased with increasing pH. Also, it was found that the culture medium  pH  significantly  shifted  towards  neutrality during  the  cultivation,  despite  buffering with  an  elevated phosphate concentration.

{"chunk": "[Section: Effects of Phosphate Concentration]\n/r nl Figure 3 shows the effects of  the culture medium phosphate  concentration  at  pH  7.0  on  cell  growth  and whole-cell  MMO  activity.

A high phosphate level is known to inhibit whole-cell methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) activity and to result in the accumulation of  methanol in the culture medium.\"  But it is not clear why M. trichosporium OB3b can  tolerate  more highly elevated phosphate concentrations than M. capsulatus (Bath). Both  the  propene  and  the  chloroform oxidative MMO  activities in  Figure 3  are  seen  to be constant  up  to  80  mM phosphate,  irrespective of  the decreasing trend  in  specific growth  rate.  At  approximately 90-100 mM phosphate,  however, a  sharp increase in MMO propene activity was observed, yielding an absolute specific activity of 220 nmol/mg dry cell wt min.  This  higher propene  oxidative activity is due to the production of  pMMO, not  an elevated production of  sMMO, because cells grown on 100 mM or higher phosphate  do  not  display  any  detectable activity with chloroform (Fig. 3).\n\nThis observation raised  an interesting question concerning the role of  phosphate in regulating the form of MMO, namely whether the shift in enzyme location is due to a high phosphate concentration per se or due to Cu contaminants  present  in  the  Na/K  salts  that  are used  in  preparing  high  phosphate  culture  medium. Another shake flask experiment combined with culture medium  Cu  analyses,  therefore,  was  conducted  to answer this question. With 100 mM phosphate, it was observed that propene oxidative activity was high (ca. 200 nmol/mg  dry  cell  wt  min)  at  a  low  cell  density (A 6 6 0 = 0.28), but it declined to 95 nmol/mg dry cell wt min when the A6 6 0 reached 0.6.  Correspondingly, chloroform oxidative activity was  not  detected  at  the  low cell  density, but  it  appeared (22 nmol/mg  dry  cell wt min) at the higher cell density when the propene activity declined. Moreover, inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses revealed that  the  Cu concentration was ca. 0.2 p M for 100 mM phosphate medium compared to only 0.02 p M for 10 mM phosphate medium. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that  the production of  pMMO in Figure 3 at high phosphate concentrations is due to traces of  carry-over Cu contamination in the Na/K salts.",

At 50-60 h, however, a rapid decrease of p to 0.008 h-'  was observed and this slow rate continued for approximately a week before  the  cell  growth  completely stopped.

It is worth noting that there was no appreciable change in sMMO activity at around 50-60 h, i.e., before and after the large shift in the growth rate. Under these culture conditions  the level  of  sMMO  catalysis  and, presumably, the rate of  methane assimilation are not proportional  to  the  bacterial  growth  rate.  A  biphasic growth curve and the nonvarying sMMO activity have not  been  addressed in  the past,  but  they  may  explain why the reported values for the methane consumption efficiency (defined as g dry cell wt produced/g methane consumed) of M. trichosporium OB3b and several other methanotrophs  are  not  consistent  and  vary  widely.'*'6 Figure 5 also shows that the decrease of the growth rate coincided with the depletion of  culture medium nitrate at  50-60 h.  This  indicated  that  the  transition  might be induced by  a switch of  the nitrogen source from nitrate  to the  gaseous nitrogen  that  is  carried  into  the bioreactor as  part  of  the 9:l air/C02 mixture.  It  has been  established that M. trichosporiurn OB3b can fix gaseous  nitrogen  through  a  nitrogenase  which  is  inducible  under  either  nitrate-  or  ammonium-limiting culture  condition^.^,^\n\nThe effect of  nitrate on the cell growth and the transition in the growth rate was investigated further: first, by  varying  its  concentration  in  the  bioreactor culture medium,  and  next,  by  transferring  bioreactor  cells growing in two different growth phases into fresh culture  media.  Figure  6  shows  the  cell  densities  both at  the  transitions ( X , ) and  at  the  ends  of  the  batch cultures as a function of the initial medium nitrate concentration. Parameter X, was determined by extrapolating the straight lines during both growth phases. When the nitrate  concentration  was varied  over  the  range from 5 to 20 mM, X, increased with increasing nitrate although  the  final  cell  densities were  practically constant.  Cell  yield  on  nitrate  was  determined  from  the slope in Figure 6 to be  1 0 0  g dry cell wt/mol  nitrate or 7.14 g dry cell wt/g N. It is in close agreement with the theoretical value estimated from elemental analyses of various methanotrophs.'  At a much higher nitrate concentration (40 mM), however,  the  exponential  fast growth rate began to decrease well before most of  the nitrate was consumed and the proportionality shown in Figure 6 did not extent to this higher nitrate concentration (data not shown). Figure 7 shows the results of  the culture transfer  experiments. Microorganisms growing in the bioreactor were transferred  at two separate times into shake flasks containing fresh media with either no added  nitrate  or  10  m M  nitrate.  When  fast  growing early  stage bioreactor  cells were  transferred  into  the fresh nitrate-containing medium at 20 h, they exhibited the same rapid growth rate. Similarly,  when slow growing late-stage bioreactor cells were transferred  at 150 h, nitrate quickly restored most of  their earlier fast growth rate.

{"chunk": "[Section: Effect of Iron]\nIn most batch cultures, microorganisms stop growing at the end of  cultivation due to either the depletion of  essential  nutrients  or  the  accumulation  of  inhibitory metabolites in  the  culture  medium.  Since raising the medium nitrate concentration did not influence the final cell density (Fig. 6) and the metabolites present in the spent bioreactor medium did not inhibit cell growth (data  not  shown), the  maximal cell  density attainable with the medium in Table I (lacking CuS04)  seems to be determined by some component(s)  other than the C, 0,  and N sources. In an effort to identify one such limiting component, the effect of  the culture medium Fe level was investigated (Table IV). When  about half  of the  usual  Higgins medium  Fe  level (18 pmol/L)  was employed, whole-cell propene oxidative sMMO activity decreased  sharply  from 105 nmol  propene oxide formed/mg dry cell wt min to 47  nmol/mg  dry cell wt min at around 70 h. The cell density at that  time was 1.5 g dry wt/L,  which  was  also about one-half of the final cell density achievable with the standard medium Fe  level of 40 pmol/L  (Table I).  When  an  additional 50  pmol/L  of  Fe  was  supplemented  at  90  h  (total 68 pmol/L), a normal high level of  the sMMO activity was  restored  within 24 h.  Furthermore,  cell  growth ( p = 0.009  h-') continued  up  to 5.4 g  dry  cell  wt/L without any appreciable decline in the whole cell enzymatic  activity.  This  rapid  and  large  Fe  effect  on  the sMMO activity is not too suprising, considering that Fe is an essential cofactor for the sMMO enzyme complex which can represent more than 10% of  the total soluble protein in some methanotr~phs.'~*'~~~~ From the dependence of  the final cell density on the initial medium Fe level, i.e., up to 40 pmol/L, it was possible to calculate the cell yield  on  Fe  as  approximately 1.3 x lo3 g  dry cell  wt/g  Fe.

Our major  findings  can  be  summarized as follows:\n\nExclusively sMMO activity was observed only in cells grown on minus-Cu medium.\n\nCell growth was found to be optimal at pH 6.07.0,  a  temperature  of  30-34\"C,  and  a  phosphate concentration of  10-40  mM.\n\nWhen M. trichosporium OB3b was cultivated in a bioreactor with continuous sparging of  its gaseous substrates, external C 0 2   addition was important to eliminate a long lag period in the cell growth.\n\nIn  bioreactor  experiments  employing minus-Cu medium and the continuous supply of  a methane/ air/COz  gas mixture, a diauxic growth pattern was observed which was caused by  a switch in the nitrogen source from nitrate to gaseous nitrogen. A twofold  increase  in  the  culture  medium  nitrate concentration is recommended to delay the nitrate depletion and hence to shorten the total cultivat  ion time.\n\nSustaining a high whole-cell specific sMMO activity  in  the  bioreactor  was  dependent  on  the  Fe\n\navailability  in  Higgins  culture  medium  lackjng CuS04. It  is  recommended  that  the  standard medium Fe  level be  increased to 80  pmol/L  for bioreactor experiments.\n\nThe final bioreactor cell density was increased either by  raising the culture medium Fe level or by using  twofold  concentrated  complete  medium. Therefore, the use of  medium concentrated possibly  up  to  fourfold  is  suggested,  provided  the greater  oxygen  demand  can  be  satisfied  in  the bioreactor system to be used.\n\nThis work was performed under the auspices of the U.S. Department  of  Energy by  the  Lawrence  Livermore  National Laboratory  (LLNL) under  contract  number  W-7405-ENG48; it was  supported  by  the  LLNL Institutional  Research and  Development  Program.
