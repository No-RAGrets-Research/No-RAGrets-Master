{"chunk": "[Section: ABSTRACT]\nMethylosinus trichosporium OB3b  is  a methanotrophic bacterium containing methane  mono-oxygenase, catalyzing hydroxylation of  methane to  methanol. When methane  is oxidized, the  product is  subsequently oxidized  by methanol  dehydrogenase contained in  the  same bacterium. To prevent further oxidation of  methanol, the  cell suspension was treated by cyclopropanol, an irreversible inhibitor for  methanol  dehydrogenase, leading to  extracellular methanol  accumulation. However,  the  reaction was terminated at  approx  3  h with  a  final methanol  concentration below 2.96  mmol/g dry  cell. The  methanol  production efficiency (the ratio of  the produced  methanol  per  methane  consumption) was 2.90%.  By selecting the  culture conditions and  the  reaction conditions, the  reaction continued for  100  h,  resulting in  a  methanol  concentration of  152  mmol/g dry  cell. This  level was 51  times higher than  that of  the  conventional reaction, and the  methanol  production efficiency was 61%.\n\nIndex  Entries: Methanol  synthesis; methane  monooxygenase; methanol

{"chunk": "[Section: Effect of  Cu Concentration  in  Growth  Medium]\nM. trichosporium OB3b was cultivated in  mineral salts media  containing cupric sulfate. As shown in  Fig. 1, the  growth  rate of M. trichosporium OB3b and  the  maximum  cell density decreased with  increasing Cu concentration, up to  20  ~M. The  maximum  specific growth  rate was 1.59 x 10-3/min, and the  maximum  cell density was 0.235 mg dry  cell/mL at  1.25 ~d of  Cu concentration. M. trichosporium OB3b  grew nicely at  1.25  ~,/of Cu concentration, and  grew  slowly at 20  ~M  of  Cu concentration.\n\nMMO activities of  these bacteria were  measured  by  propene  epoxidation. MMO activity was  directly related to  the Cu concentration up  to 20  ~,I. The maximum  MMO activity was 98.6 nmol of  propene  oxide  formed/mg dry  cell/mL at  20 ~ of  Cu concentration. As shown in  Table  1, M. trichosporium OB3b  grown under  20  ~ of  Cu concentration showed higher MMO activity than  the  cell grown at  1.25 ~I and 0.21 ~d of  Cu concentration. However, M. trichosporium OB3b  grew slowly  at  20 ~tM of  Cu concentration. Thus,  the  methanol  synthesis reaction was carried out  by M. trichosporium OB3b  grown  in  1.25 ~ Cu concentration, which  was the highest specific growth  rate, and  comparatively high  MMO activity.\n\nM. trichosporium OB3b  expresses either sMMO or  particulate MMO (pMMO),  and  the form  expressed strongly depended  on  the  concentration of  Cu during the  growth (5). At  low  Cu concentration sMMO is expressed. Otherwise, pMMO is expressed.\n\nMMO activities of these bacteria were measured  by the  naphthalene hydroxylation assay. Naphthalene hydroxylation assay has  been  used  as  an indicator for  sMMO activity potential in  methanotrophs (4).

These  results  uggest that M. trichosporium OB3b  grown  in  0.21  pM  Cu concentration expresses mainly  sMMO, and M. trichosporium OB3b  grown over  1.25  ~M  Cu concentration expresses only  pMMO.

{"chunk": "[Section: Optimization  of  Methanol Biosynthesis]\nTo optimize  methanol  accumulation by M. trichosporium OB3b, the effects of  cell density, reaction temperature, concentration of  sodium formate,  concentration of  phosphate  buffer, pH  7.0,  and concentration of cyclopropanol were  examined.\n\nThe study  on the  effect of  cell density on methanol  accumulation by M. trichosporium OB3b  indicated the  optimum cell density to  be  34.6 ~tg  of dry  cell/mL  (Fig. 2A).  At  higher cell density, there was no further increase in  methanol  accumulation.\n\nThe effect of  reaction temperature on methanol accumulation  by M. trichosporium OB3b  indicated the  optimum  temperature to  be 25~ (Fig. 2B).  Increasing the  temperature results in  a decrease in  methanol accumulation, possibly caused  by  instability ofthe  enzyme pMMO.\n\nThe relationship between concentration of sodium formate  and methanol  accumulation was studied (Fig. 2C).  The  methanol  accumulation increased with  increasing concentration of  sodium formate, and  was saturated by  more than  14.3  mM  sodium formate.\n\nMehta and coworkers  reported that high  concentration of  phosphate ions  (>80 mM)  selectively inhibited MDH activity in  the  cells of M. trichosporium NCIB  11131 (8). In  the case  of M. trichosporium OB3b, high  concentration of  phosphate  buffer, pH  7.0,  also  inhibited MDH activity.\n\n8\n\n1001\n\n80\n\n.~\n\n60\n\n,0\n\n2O\n\nA\n\nv\n\nA\n\n0\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\nCyclopropanol /  tiM\n\nHowever,  the  methanol  accumulation decreased with  increasing concentration of  phosphate buffer, pH 7.0. These  results show that high  concentration of  phosphate ions  inhibited not  only  MDH activity, but  also pMMO activity in  the  cells.\n\nTo produce  methanol  by M.  trichosporium OB3b, it  is  necessary to inhibit the  oxidation of  methanol by  MDH contained in  the same  bacterium. In  this study, the  cell suspension was treated with  cyclopropanol, which  was an  irreversible inhibitor for MDH (2).\n\nFigure  3  shows  the  effects of  cyclopropanol concentration on  pMMO activity and  MDH activity (the activities were  measured  by  propene  epoxidation and  methanol  consumption, respectively). In  the  presence of  cyclopropanol, the  MDH activity decreased with  increasing cyclopropanol concentration. When  the  concentration of  cyclopropanol was 6.18  ~tM in the  reaction mixture, the  MDH activity decreased by 79.3%;  however, pMMO activity was not  affected. When the  concentration of  cyclopropanol was 6.18  W~I,  the  loss of  pMMO activity was only  12%.\n\n0.32\n\n20\n\n\"7\n\n15\n\n.=\n\nlo\n\n0\n\nr\n\n..G\n\n\"$\n\n5\n\nI\n\nI\n\nI\n\n0\n\n0.08\n\n0.16\n\n0.24\n\nCycIopropanol\n\n/  ~M\n\nFigure  4 shows the  effect of  cyclopropanol on methanol  accumulation. The maximum  methanol  accumulation was observed  with  0.67 cyclopropanol in  the  reaction mixture. In  this cyclopropanol concentration, the  losses of  MMO activity and MDH activity in M. trichosporium OB3b were 5.2  and 49.8%, respectively. Thus,  when MDH activity in  the  cell remained  more than  50%, the  maximum methanol  accumulation was observed. These  results  uggest that the  MDH activity has  a  strong effect on  the  pMMO activity in  vivo.\n\nIn  previous  studies, Tonge and coworkers (9) proposed  that  the physiological electron donor  for pMMO in M. trichosporium OB3b was not NADH,  but  rather that the  immediate  donor  was the  CO-binding  cytochrome  c, being  reduced  in  turn by  the  MDH.  Andrew and  coworkers (10) also  reported that quinols were capable  of  directly reducing  detergentsolubilized pMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath). The  propene  epoxidation by the  cells that were not  treated with  cyclopropanol was measured in  the presence  of  methanol  instead of  sodium formate. The rate  of  propene oxide  formation was 116 ~tmol/min/g of  dry  cell, similar to  the  rate of methanol  consumption  (117  ~tmol/min/g of  dry  cell). This  result suggests that in  this system  the  rate of  methane  hydroxylation (the pMMO activity) is  limited by the  rate of  methanol  consumption  (the MDH activity), and\n\n160\n\ni\n\n,o
