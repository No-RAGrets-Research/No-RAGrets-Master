{"chunk": "[Section: 1. INTRODUCTION]\nMethanotrophic bacteria are unique in their ability to utilize methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as their sole carbon source (Hanson & Hanson, 1996). In the first step of their metabolic pathway, methane is oxidized to methanol, which can be utilized as a cheap carbon feedstock for industrial chemical processes (Lawton & Rosenzweig, 2016). For this reason, there have been extensive efforts to understand methanotrophy in multiple species of bacteria. Most aerobic methanotrophs are classified as Type I (Gammaproteobacteria) or Type II (Alphaproteobacteria) based on their use of either the ribulose monophosphate or serine cycles for carbon assimilation, respectively, as well as their phospholipid compositions, cell morphologies, and membrane arrangements (Hanson & Hanson, 1996; Semrau, DiSpirito, & Yoon, 2010). Methane is oxidized to methanol by methane monooxygenase enzymes (MMOs), followed by methanol conversion to formaldeyhde by methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs). There are two types of MMO, a soluble and cytoplasmic iron-containing enzyme (sMMO) and a 'particulate' and inner membrane-bound copper-containing enzyme (pMMO) (Ross & Rosenzweig, 2016). With the exception of the genera Methylocella and Methyloferula , aerobic methanotrophs express pMMO under most conditions (Semrau et al., 2010; Vorobev et al., 2011). Under copperstarved conditions, some Type I and Type II methanotrophs can switch to sMMOexpression(Semrauetal., 2010), and some Methylosinus and Methylocystis species also produce the copper chelator methanobactin (Dassama, Kenney, & Rosenzweig, 2017).\n\nMethylosinus trichosporium OB3bis the best studied Type II methanotroph (Stein et al., 2010). This bacterium can express both sMMO and pMMO, produces methanobactin (Dassama et al., 2017), and can express two distinct MDHs, the calcium-binding MxaF and the lanthanide-binding XoxF (Haque, Kalidass, et al., 2015). Genetic tools developed previously for Ms. trichosporium OB3b have been used to mutate or disrupt the genes encoding several important proteins. Recent studies have focused on sMMO (Borodina, Nichol, Dumont, Smith, & Murrell, 2007; Lock, Nichol, Murrell, & Smith, 2017; Semrau et al., 2013; Smith & Murrell, 2011; Smith, Slade, Burton, Murrell, & Dalton, 2002), proteins in the extended pmo operon (Gu, Haque, & Semrau, 2017), methanobactin transport and biosynthetic proteins (Dassama, Kenney, Ro, Zielazinski, & Rosenzweig, 2016; Gu,\n\nBaral, DiSpirito, & Semrau, 2017; Gu et al., 2016; Gu, Haque, et al., 2017), and genes related to MDH (Haque, Gu, DiSpirito, & Semrau, 2015).\n\nIn recent years, new genetic manipulation tools have been developed for two Type I haloalkaliphilic methanotrophs, Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2008; Ojala, Beck, & Kalyuzhnaya, 2011) and Methylomicrobium buryatense 5G (Puri et al., 2015; Yan, Chu, Puri, Fu, & Lidstrom, 2016). These protocols have been used to engineer methanotrophs for biofuel production (de la Torre et al., 2015; Henard et al., 2016; Kalyuzhnaya, Puri, & Lidstrom, 2015) and have also enabled studies of lanthanide-dependent methanol oxidation (Chu & Lidstrom, 2016), ectoine biosynthesis (Mustakhimov et al., 2009), and fatty acid biosynthesis (Demidenko, Akberdin, Allemann, Allen, & Kalyuzhnaya, 2017). This chapter describes the incorporation of these newer techniques developed for Type I methanotrophs into the traditional mutagenesis protocol for Ms. trichosporium OB3b (Murrell, 1994; Lloyd, Finch, Dalton, & Murrell, 1999; Smith & Murrell, 2011). By simplifying cloning, gene delivery via conjugation or electroporation, and DNA isolation for genotyping, this hybrid method will facilitate future investigations and engineering of Ms. trichosporium OB3b.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/13", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 46.308, "t": 545.28, "r": 369.209, "b": 239.95500000000004, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/14", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 46.291, "t": 236.041, "r": 369.218, "b": 78.60500000000002, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/17", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 62.759, "t": 583.434, "r": 385.52, "b": 560.553, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/18", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 62.751, "t": 556.508, "r": 385.588, "b": 331.869, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "1.

{"chunk": "[Section: 2. MS. TRICHOSPORIUM OB3B GROWTH CONDITIONS]\nMs. trichosporium OB3b strains are grown in nitrate minimal salt (NMS) media (Hakemian et al., 2008) (Table 1). Cultures are grown under either low copper (0.1 μ M CuSO4) or high copper (10 -25 μ M CuSO4) conditions in liquid cultures and agar plates. Many genes of interest in methanotrophs are copper regulated, and it may be necessary to alter the copper concentration to ensure viability and to avoid selection against the genetic modifications. Similar considerations may be appropriate for genes regulated by other environmental factors.\n\nInitially, cells at an OD 600 of 0.1 are inoculated into 50mL cultures in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks sealed with rubber septa. The flasks are then incubated at 30 ° C with shaking at 200rpm, and oxygen and methane levels are maintained via daily sparging with a 1:3 methane-to-air ratio at 1L/min for 5min. An OD600 of /C24 1.5 is typically reached after 1 week of growth. Agar plates are incubated in GasPak plate incubation chambers (BD) at 30 ° C, and gas exchange is facilitated by use of a vacuum to create negative pressure inside the chamber followed by gas flow at a 1:1 methane-to-air ratio at\n\nZnSO4 /C1 7H2O, 0.288; MnCl2 /C1 4H2O, 0.16; H3BO3, 0.06; Na2MoO4 /C1 2H2O, 0.048; CoCl2 /C1 6H2O, 0.048; KI, 0.083\n\n1L/min for 3min.

{"chunk": "[Section: 3. PLASMIDS FOR MUTAGENESIS]\nFor chromosomal site-directed mutagenesis or gene deletion, a broad host range vector pk18 mobsacB (Sch € afer et al., 1994) has been used in several methanotrophs, including Ms. trichosporium OB3b (Borodina et al., 2007). However, it is sometimes difficult to insert methanotroph genes, including those in the pmo operon, into this plasmid due to leaky expression at high copy number and subsequent toxicity of the product proteins in E. coli (Ojala et al., 2011). We have employed the following two strategies to circumvent this issue. First, we use the chemically competent E. coli strain CopyCutter EPI400 (Lucigen), designed to control plasmid copy number, to increase the success rate for cloning of methanotroph genes. However, the plasmid must then be incorporated into the E. coli donor strain S17-1 (Simon, Priefer, & P € uhler, 1983) for subsequent conjugation. Transformation into S17-1 can also fail due to leaky expression. As a second, alternative strategy, we have constructed a modified version of pk18 mobsacB under p15a copy control (Selzer, Som, Itoh, & Tomizawa, 1983) to generate the plasmid pk18 mobsacB _p15a (Fig. 1; Table 3). This shuttle vector has improved the efficiency of cloning methanotroph genes, such as those in the pmo operon (Ojala et al., 2011).\n\nReplicative plasmids are useful tools for protein overexpression or probing promoters. We tested a replicative plasmid compatible with Type I methanotrophs for function in Ms. trichosporium OB3b.

{"chunk": "[Section: 4. GENETIC MANIPULATION VIA CONJUGATION]\nThe most common and efficient method for genetic manipulation in methanotrophs requires conjugation (Lloyd et al., 1999; Murrell, 1994; Smith & Murrell, 2011). Typically after conjugation, the shuttle plasmid is incorporated into the chromosome of the recipient strain, followed by counterselection to ensure double recombination and removal of the vector backbone from the chromosome (Lalioti & Heath, 2001). In Ms. trichosporium OB3b, the established conjugation method involves the addition of liquid cultures of both methanotroph and E. coli cells onto a 0.2μ msterile filter paper for mating (Smith & Murrell, 2011). This protocol requires the use and subsequent dismantling of a plastic filter unit or a Pyrex microfiltration glass assembly, followed by cell recovery from filter paper,\n\n5'\n\nsacB\n\ngen?\n\nwhich can increase the risk of contamination. A simpler conjugation protocol has been developed for the Type I methanotrophs M. buryatense 5G and M. alcaliphilum 20Z (Ojala et al., 2011; Puri et al., 2015).

Specifically, a sterile cell spreader is dragged once across the plate containing the recipient methanotroph cells, and then is immediately used to inoculate the mating plate (Table 1). This is repeated for the donor ( E. coli ) strain, and the donor cells are plated directly on top of the recipient cells in the mating plate.\n\nThese plates are then incubated at a 1:1 methane-to-air ratio for 48h at 30 ° C in a GasPak chamber.\n\nA fraction of the mated cells, just enough to be visible on the bottom of the sterile cell spreader, are scraped off the mating plate and directly plated onto a selection agar plate (Table 1) containing kanamycin (25 μ g/mL).

One common use of this technique is gene disruption via insertion of a linear DNA fragment containing an antibiotic resistance cassette into the middle of the target gene.

{"chunk": "[Section: 6.1 DNA Extraction From Ms. trichosporium OB3b Cells on Agar Plates]\nDNA extraction from Ms. trichosporium OB3b is less efficient than DNA extraction from many Type I or Type II methanotrophic bacteria. Existing methods use the neutral lysis/CsCl method or a DNeasy Blood Tissue Kit (Qiagen) for DNA extractions from liquid cultures (Gu et al., 2016; Smith & Murrell, 2011). However, growing liquid cultures to genotype multiple colonies is time-consuming. Instead, an improved method has been developed to extract DNA from cells growing on agar plates using the MasterPure Complete DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre, Cat. No. MC85200). This method allows for higher-throughput of genotype screening and provides increased yields of DNA from smaller amounts of cells. The MasterPure Complete DNA Purification Kit protocol has been modified for Ms. trichosporium OB3b:\n\nAdd 20 μ L Proteinase K (NEB, 800U/mL) into 300 μ L 2 /C2 tissue and cell lysis solution for each sample.\n\nDrag a sterile inoculating loop across the agar plate culture until the loop is covered with cells (Fig. 5).\n\nSwirl the inoculating loop in the lysis solution and resuspend fully by pipetting.\n\nIncubate the sample at 65 ° C overnight at 500rpm.\n\nAdd 5 μ L RNase A (Epicentre, 5 μ g/ μ L). Incubate for 1h at 37 ° C without shaking.\n\nPlace the samples on ice for 5min.\n\nAdd 150 μ L MPC protein precipitation reagent and vortex.\n\nCentrifuge the sample at 10,000 /C2 g at 4 ° C for 10min to pellet cell debris.\n\nTransfer the supernatant to a new tube and add 500 μ L 100% isopropanol on ice. Manually invert the sample 30 times.\n\nCentrifuge the sample at 4 ° C for 30min at 20,000 /C2 g to pellet DNA.\n\nWash the DNA pellet with 750 μ L 70% ethanol on ice. Centrifuge at 20,000 /C2 g at 4 ° C for 5min, remove the ethanol, and repeat the wash step once more.\n\nLet the pellet dry at 37 ° C until residual ethanol is gone.\n\nResuspend the pellet with 50 μ L TE buffer and incubate overnight at 4 ° C.\n\nDNA yield can vary from 10 to 60 μ g.
