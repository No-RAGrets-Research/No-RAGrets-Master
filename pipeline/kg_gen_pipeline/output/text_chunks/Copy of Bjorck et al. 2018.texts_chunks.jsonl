A Jekyll and Hyde character, it is a valuable energy source present as geological deposits of natural gas, however it is also potent greenhouse gas, released during many waste management processes. Gas-to-liquid technologies are being investigated as a means to exploit and monetise non-traditional and unutilised methane sources. The product identified as having the greatest potential is methanol due to it being a robust, commercially mature conversion process from methane and its beneficial fuel  characteristics.  Commercial  methane  to  methanol  conversion  requires  high  temperatures  and pressures, in an energy intensive and costly process. In contrast methanotrophic bacteria perform the desired transformation under ambient conditions, using methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes. Despite  the  great  potential  of  these  bacteria  a  number  of  biotechnical  difficulties  are  hindering progress towards an industrially suitable process. We have identified five major challenges that exist as barriers to a viable conversion process that, to our knowledge, have not previously been examined as  distinct  process  challenges.  Although  biotechnological  applications  of  methanotrophic  bacteria have been reviewed in part, no review has comprehensively covered progress and challenges for a methane  to  methanol  process  from  an  industrial  perspective.  All  published  examples  to  date  of methanotroph catalysed conversion of methane to methanol are collated, and standardised to allow direct comparison. The focus will be on conversion of methane to methanol by whole-cell, wild type, methanotroph cultures, and the potential for their application in an industrially relevant process.

Methane to methanol conversion is receiving increased research interest due to the drive towards sustainable technologies and renewable fuels.\n\nCompared  to  methane,  methanol  can  be  easily  used  as  a  feedstock  for  further  chemical conversion, is suitable for use in the current transportation fuel infrastructure, has a greater energy density,  and  burns  with  fewer  toxic  by-products  [3].  Methanol  is  produced  commercially  from methane via syngas, however the two-step process requires high temperatures (about 900 ° C) and pressures (3 MPa) and as such is energy intensive [4]. Despite the costs associated with the process, chemical conversion has been successfully commercialised, however the high volumes of methane necessary to make large-scale processes economically viable are not applicable for marginal fields and waste methane sources.\n\nIn contrast to chemical routes, the oxidation of methane to methanol is performed biologically by methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes in a single step at ambient temperature and pressure.

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.1. Methane sources and uses]\nThe main component of natural and shale gases, methane is considered a next-generation carbon feedstock  due  to  the  vast  global  reserves  [7],  with  geological  deposits  of  the  fossil  formed  gas frequently exploited for energy generation. In addition, it is the main constituent of biogas, produced by the microbial digestion of biomass under anaerobic conditions, and as such is a product of many waste  management  processes  and  agricultural  activity  including  enteric  fermentation  and  rice cultivation  [1].  However  methane  is  an  abundant  and  potent  GHG.  The  greatest  source  to  the atmosphere is as a result of anaerobic decay of biomass,  with anthropogenic contribution through\n\nindustrial waste production on the increase [8]. Also the energy sector is responsible for significant methane emissions released during fossil fuel exploration, extraction and transportation.\n\nAnthropogenic  methane  emissions  in  2010  were  estimated  to  be  481  billion  m 3 methane, equivalent  in  global  warming  potential  to  6867  Mt  carbon  dioxide  [1],  with  atmospheric  methane concentrations at unprecedented levels, having increased from 715 ppb to 1774 ppb over the past 300 years [6]. This, combined with a global warming potential 25 times greater than carbon dioxide, have resulted  in  methane  being  the  second  most  significant  greenhouse  gas  after  carbon  dioxide, contributing more than one-third of current anthropogenic warming [1]. Methane has a much shorter global atmospheric lifetime (12 years) compared with carbon dioxide (5-200 years) [6], so it would be possible to rapidly reduce atmospheric concentrations through a reduction in emissions. Methane mitigation  strategies  offer  both  the  potential  to  curb  atmospheric  accumulation  and  the  associated climate impact in addition to providing a valuable industrial fuel source and chemical feedstock.\n\nGlobal  natural  gas  production  in  2013  was  estimated  to  be  3369.9  billion  m 3 ,  with  proven reserves  of  185.7  trillion  m 3 [9].  Of  this  it  is  estimated  that  between  30%  and  80%  is  'stranded gas' [10], defined as natural gas that is wasted or unused because the gas field may be too small or remote for production to be economically feasible [2]. An additional environmental concern is the considerable amount of associated gas that is flared or vented during oil production encouraging the implementation of restrictions on such processes. In 2008, 139 billion m 3 of natural gas was flared globally;  equal  to  4%  of  global  natural  gas  production,  and  resulted  in  the  release  of  more  than 278 Mt of carbon dioxide [11].\n\nCombining the volume of anthropogenic waste methane emissions, stranded and associated gas demonstrates  the  huge  amount  of  unutilised  global  methane  sources  and  the  waste  of  a  valuable resource.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/29", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 184.61604394531253, "r": 544.54, "b": 74.66404394531253, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/33", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 4, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 765.6360439453125, "r": 544.552, "b": 738.6840439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/34", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 4, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 735.1900439453126, "r": 544.54, "b": 572.7040439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/35", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 4, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 569.1500439453125, "r": 547.54, "b": 439.8640439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/36", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 4, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 433.63604394531257, "r": 544.54, "b": 390.0440439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "2.1.

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.2. Gas-to-liquid technologies]\nOne difficulty in the use of methane is that it occurs as a gas under ambient conditions (boiling point  -164  ° C)  and  so  storage  and  transportation  are  costly,  further  compounded  for  diffuse  and remote  non-traditional  sources.  Conversion  to  compressed  natural  gas  (CNG)  or  liquefied  natural gas (LNG) are energy intensive and require large capital investment, in addition to being hazardous due to their high pressure (21-25 MPa) and low temperature (-164 ° C) [2]. This, and the potential to monetise unutilised methane sources has initiated interest in GTL technologies to chemically convert methane to liquid hydrocarbon products that are more readily transported. The most widely deployed, commercially  demonstrated  GTL  technologies  utilise  the  Fischer-Tropsch  conversion  process  to produce  diesel, naphtha  and  waxes  [10], although other conversion  technologies are being investigated  to  generate  products  including  methanol,  dimethyl  ether  (DME)  and  olefins.  GTL processes offer  market diversification and an opportunity to harness  remote natural gas resources, although high costs, price risks, reliability and technical difficulties have hindered implementation [4]. A number of factors impact the suitability and success of such technologies including scale, capital cost  and  potential  markets  for  products  [4].  Large-scale  projects  offer  economies  of  scale  but typically  require  high  capital  investment  and  a  constant  high  volume  input  of  methane,  not  often available at remote sources. Ultimately, the commercial viability of a plant is determined by natural\n\nMTBE\n\nFormaldehyde\n\nDehydrogenation oxidation\n\nDistillates\n\n1\n\nOligomerisation gas and product prices. Volatility and uncertainty in these markets make justifying the large capital investment  problematic.

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.3. Methanol as a sustainable liquid fuel]\nDirect use\n\nConversion to  methanol  is  an  attractive  option  due  to  the  range  of  applications  and  growing market; global methanol demand reached 70 Mt in 2015 [12].\n\nTraditionally used as a solvent and feedstock, methanol is utilised in the synthesis of industrially relevant  compounds  including  acetic  acid,  formaldehyde,  methyl  tert-butyl  ether  (MTBE),  and dimethyl ether (DME), whilst the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process can be used to produce ethylene or  propylene  which  can  be  further  processed  into  a  range  of  hydrocarbon  and  organic  polymeric materials (Figure 1).\n\nMethanol also offers great potential as an energy carrier or fuel, with an energy density greater than that of methane (15.6 MJ L -1 and 36.6 ×  10 -3 MJ L -1 respectively). There are five main fuel applications for methanol: directly as a transportation fuel; blended with petrol; converted to DME to be used as a diesel replacement; in the production of biodiesel via trans-esterification; in fuel cells to generate electricity. The current energy situation has increased interest in methanol in transportation fuel applications due to the potential for sustainable, carbon neutral sources, low cost compared to\n\n> Gasoline\n\nother fuels, and clean burning [14], in addition to offering a range of advantages over both methane, and  current  petrochemical  fuels.  Methanol  exhibits  favourable  combustion  properties,  increased engine  performance  and  greater  efficiencies  over  those  achieved  with  gasoline  [3].  Another advantage of methanol over petroleum based fuels is that it is considered both safer, with a lower or comparable toxicity, and more environmentally benign in case of uncontrolled release as it is highly biodegradable [15].\n\nPerhaps the greatest advantage of methanol as a fuel is related to the GHG emission reduction potential. Comparison of life cycle carbon intensity analysis shows that emissions from methanol as a fuel are heavily dependent on the feedstock source. Methanol from natural gas has slightly lower carbon  emissions  compared  with  those  from  conventional  gasoline  fuels.  However,  sustainably produced  bio-methanol  is  the  lowest  of  results  calculated  [3].  Combustion  of  methanol  produces fewer  toxic  by-products-about  half  as  much  carbon  monoxide  and  an  eighth  as  much  nitrogen oxides (NOx)-compared with gasoline [16]. In terms of point-of-use emissions for transportation fuels,  methanol  generates  lower  carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  unit  energy  than  conventional petrochemical fuels [17]. It is possible to blend methanol with petrol to increase the octane value and reduce  the  cost,  without  the  need  for  any  engine  modifications  [18],  however  at  high  levels  it  is corrosive requiring specific compatible engines. In an interdisciplinary report prepared by MIT [19] on the future role of natural gas as an energy source, conversion to methanol is identified as having the lowest cost and GHG emissions in comparison with alternative liquid fuel products as well as being the only potential transformation that has been produced for a long period at an industrial scale.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/51", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 234.42859789273908, "t": 646.9373503605508, "r": 269.7801131001855, "b": 638.7222496557995, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/52", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 632.8360439453126, "r": 544.54, "b": 605.8840439453126, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/53", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 599.5960439453125, "r": 544.528, "b": 522.9040439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/55", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 167.99604394531252, "r": 544.54, "b": 74.66404394531253, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/56", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 297.5774732956963, "t": 669.57487401129, "r": 348.5023808623277, "b": 657.3676524009184, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/60", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 765.6360439453125, "r": 544.576, "b": 672.3040439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/61", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 666.0160439453125, "r": 547.48, "b": 439.8640439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "2.3.

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.4. Conversion of methane to methanol]\nIn theory, conversion of methane gas to liquid products offers many advantages, however the current  reality  is  that  processes  are  energetically  inefficient  and  costly.  The  highly  inert  nature  of saturated hydrocarbons makes chemical transformation challenging, and although high temperatures and pressures can be employed to promote reaction, this often results in loss of selectivity and low yields.  As  the  dissociation  energy  of  the  C-H  bond  in  methane  (440  kJ  mol -1 )  is  greater  than methanol (393 kJ mol -1 ),  under  oxidising  conditions, the  product  methanol  reacts preferentially  to methane forming a mixture of products including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, and formic acid [20].\n\nCurrent commercial methanol production overcomes selectivity issues by utilising  a two-step process in which fossil methane is first converted to syngas via steam reforming, followed by the metal-catalysed methanol synthesis step in an overall endothermic process (ΔH° = +116 kJ mol -1 ) (Figure 2). Initial  conversion  of  methane  and  water  to  carbon  monoxide  and  hydrogen  is  an  energy  intensive process,  operating  at  temperatures  around  900  ° C  and  pressures  of  3  MPa  [4].  Harsh  reaction conditions necessitate costly equipment that account for approximately 60% of the process capital costs [21,22]. In addition, the overall process has a conversion rate of ~25% and selectivity ~70% [21].\n\nInterest  in  a  direct,  single  step  oxidation  of  methane  to  methanol  is  vast,  driven  by  many potential advantages over the conventional two-step process. In contrast to the indirect commercial process, the single step oxidation of methane to methanol is an exothermic reaction (ΔH° = -128 kJ mol -1 ) (Figure 3), avoiding the energy intensive, inefficient and expensive\n\nCH, + ½ O2\n\nCH, + H,0\n\nCO + 2H2\n\nCO + 3H2\n\nCO+3 H2\n\nCH.OH\n\nД,H° = + 206 kJ mol-l\n\nAH° = - 128 kJ mol-'\n\nA,H° = - 90 kJ mol-'\n\n(1)\n\n(3)\n\n(2)\n\nsyngas formation step. Mild reaction conditions also negate the need for specialist, costly equipment. Despite significant interest and effort in the direct partial oxidation of methane to methanol, many difficulties  remain  unsolved  and  as  such  the  selective  C-H  bond  activation  required  often  is described as the 'Holy Grail' of Chemistry [23].\n\nIn summary, methane is a major contributor to the climate change problem that could instead be exploited  as  a  chemical  industry  feedstock  and  as  a  fuel.

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.1. Methanotrophs: a brief introduction — Part 1]\nThe first methanotroph was isolated by Sö hngen in 1906 which he named Bacillus methanicus [26] . Since then the most significant contribution was made by Whittenbury and his colleagues in 1970, in which over 100 methane-utilising bacteria were isolated, characterised and compared [27]. Playing an important role in the global methane cycle, methane-oxidising bacteria are found across a broad range of natural environments, present in nearly all samples taken from soil, swamps, rivers, oceans,\n\nCH, -\n\nCH,OH\n\nponds and sewage sludge, reportedly representing up to 8%  of the total 'heterotrophic' population [28]. As the majority of methane is naturally produced through the anaerobic decay of organic  matter,  they  are  found  primarily  at  oxic-anoxic  interfaces.  The  majority  of  known methanotrophs are aerobic, however, methane oxidation is known to occur in anaerobic environments by coupling oxidation to sulphate [29] and nitrite reduction  [30].  As expected from their prevalence within the environment, methanotrophs are found in both mesophilic and extreme environments.  Strains  have  been  isolated  from  temperatures  as  low  as  4  ° C  [31]  and  as  high  as 72  ° C  [32]  and  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  populations  of  methanotrophs  in  nature  adapt  to different temperatures [5].\n\nTwo populations of methanotrophs have been identified that exist depending on environmental methane  availability [33]. Low  affinity  methanotrophs  are able to utilise methane  at high concentrations (>40 ppm), and are observed in soils with high methane exposure, accounting for all isolated  methanotroph  cultures  known  to  date.  High  affinity  methanotrophs  are  able  to  oxidise ambient methane concentrations (~ 2 ppm) and although their existence within soil samples has been verified using molecular techniques, isolation of such bacteria has not yet been possible. Analysis of nucleic acids (DNA  and  RNA),  phospholipids,  methane  oxidation  rates  and  stable isotope probing (SIP) using 13 C labelled methane has provided characterisation information, and confirmed relatively  low  abundance  of  these  high  affinity  methanotrophs  in  soils  [34].  In  contrast  to  the relatively high abundance of methanotroph populations present in the environment, these low affinity methanotrophs account for <0.01% of total bacteria biomass in soils, attributed to low atmospheric methane concentrations [34].\n\nMethane  monooxygenase  (MMO)  enzymes  catalyse  the  initial  oxidation  of  methane  to methanol,  followed  by  sequential  oxidation  to  formaldehyde  by  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH), oxidation of formaldehyde to formate by formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FADH), and finally formate to carbon dioxide by formate dehydrogenase (FDH). Formaldehyde is assimilated into biomass by either the ribulose monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, or the serine pathway. Figure 4 illustrates the metabolism of methane by methanotrophs.\n\nCytral\n\n0, pMMO\n\nH,O CyCox\n\nRuMP Serine pathway pathway\n\nTraditionally,  all  aerobic  methane-oxidising  bacteria  were  of  the  phylum Proteobacteria ,  and classified  into  two  major  groups:  Type  I  and  Type  II,  based  on  differences  in  physiological  and morphological traits, with Type X methanotrophs further differentiated from Type I [36,37]. Recent characterisation of several new genera and species, and the subsequent increase in the diversity of known methanotrophs, meant this system was no longer useful to characterise all known species, resulting in an update in the taxonomical description used to classify these organisms.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/91", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 7, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 151.38804394531257, "r": 544.6, "b": 74.66404394531253, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/95", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 37.999999800000005, "t": 776.5867105986458, "r": 57.999999800000005, "b": 767.2533772653125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/96", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 189.8887060030487, "t": 776.9406397896227, "r": 218.77796025516457, "b": 766.8994480527656, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/97", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 765.6360439453125, "r": 547.54, "b": 622.5040439453126, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/98", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 616.2160439453125, "r": 547.48, "b": 423.3040439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/99", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 416.9960439453125, "r": 544.54, "b": 323.6840439453126, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/101", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 66.0, "t": 797.9200440453125, "r": 86.0, "b": 789.9200440453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/102", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 90.66666672777778, "t": 799.2533772119791, "r": 99.33333339444444, "b": 791.2533772119792, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}, {"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 111.33333317619048, "t": 794.586710569122, "r": 133.33333317619048, "b": 785.9200439024554, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/103", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 144.66666702, "t": 802.5867106119791, "r": 180.00000035333332, "b": 794.5867106119791, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/104", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 255.30781245552393, "t": 805.4071384634954, "r": 310.6921864382713, "b": 795.7662826743108, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}, {"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 253.99999960666665, "t": 795.2533773719791, "r": 313.33333294, "b": 785.9200440386459, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/108", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 765.6480439453126, "r": 544.564, "b": 672.3040439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "3.1.

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.2. Biochemistry of methane oxidation using methane monooxygenase (MMO)]\nUnique to methanotrophs is possession of MMO enzymes that catalyse the oxidation of methane to methanol. The initial reaction in the sequential oxidation to carbon dioxide, it is oxygen dependent and the most chemically difficult step. The monooxygenase splits the O-O bond of dioxygen using two reducing equivalents, with one of the oxygen atoms incorporated into methane to form methanol and the other reduced to water [47].\n\nTwo  types  of  MMO  have  been  found  in  methanotrophic  bacteria;  a  soluble  cytoplasmic form  (sMMO)  and  a  particulate  membrane-bound  form  (pMMO).  All  methanotrophs,  with  the exception of members of the genera Methylocella [48] and Methyloferula [49],  have the ability to produce pMMO, however Type II methanotrophs are also able to produce sMMO. For those strains able  to  produce  both  forms,  the  environmental  growth  conditions are  responsible  for  dictating  the type of enzyme expressed within the cell, with dependence primarily on the availability of copper. Under  conditions  of  copper  excess  (>0.85  µ mol  g -1 dry  weight  of  cells)  pMMO  is  produced preferentially, while under conditions of limited copper availability, sMMO is generated, although the two are not mutually exclusive [50]. The dependence on copper availability is attributed to its presence in the active site of the pMMO enzyme [51].\n\nThe relative ease of isolation of sMMO has resulted in it being thoroughly studied and fully characterised [47,52]. sMMO  is  known  to be made up of three protein components: a hydroxylase (MMOH), a regulatory protein (MMOB), and a reductase (MMOR). The hydroxylase protein is made up of three polypeptide subunits, arranged as a α2β2γ2 dimer, and contains a di-iron active site where oxygen and methane react using electrons supplied from NADH oxidation at the reductase, facilitated by the regulatory protein [47]. In contrast, significantly less is known about the biocatalysis and structure of pMMO, despite it being more prevalent in nature, due to difficulties in isolation and stability of the membrane bound protein. pMMO is known to be comprised of three subunits: PmoA, PmoB and PmoC, arranged in a trimeric α3β3γ3 complex, with the di-copper active site on the soluble part of the PmoB subunit [53,54]. A number of recent reviews give full structural and mechanistic details of sMMO and pMMO [47,55-57]. Despite their similar function within the cell, sMMO and pMMO are not related structurally or genetically.\n\nBoth  forms  of  MMO  are  able  to  co-oxidise  a  range  of  organic  substrates  in  the  presence  of methane  although  they  do  not  support in  vivo growth  [58,59].  sMMO  exhibits  broader  substrate specificity and is able to catalyse a larger number of biotransformations than pMMO. Preferential oxidation of smaller substrates by the pMMO system led to understanding that access to the active site of pMMO is sterically more restricted than sMMO [60]. The differences between the two forms of MMO have been predicted to lead to specific phenotypic differences. Cells that contain pMMO have  greater  growth  yields,  attributed  to  a  reduction  in  the  energetic  requirement,  and  exhibit  a higher affinity  for  methane  than those  containing  sMMO  [61,62].  This  is  related  to  differences  in reducing power utilisation between pMMO and sMMO. Electrons required for the initial oxidation step  are  provided  by  NADH  in  the  sMMO  catalysed  reaction,  whereas  pMMO  utilises  reducing equivalents provided by the MDH co-factor pyrroloquinoline-quinone (PQQ) [61,62].", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/115", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 732.4560439453126, "r": 544.456, "b": 655.6840439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/116", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 649.3960439453125, "r": 547.54, "b": 489.6640439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/117", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 483.4360439453125, "r": 547.48, "b": 290.4440439453126, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/118", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 284.21604394531255, "r": 544.54, "b": 107.84404394531248, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "3.2.

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.2.2. High salt concentrations]\nA range of inorganic compounds have been investigated offering MDH inhibition with varying effects on MMO activity. These are considered advantageous over inhibitors such as cyclopropanol as  they  are  cheaper,  more  chemically  stable  and  exhibit  reversible  nature.  It  is  believed  that electrostatic  interactions  between  MDH  and  cytochrome c L,  the  primary  electron  acceptor,  can  be disrupted by high salt concentrations in the culture medium, thus deactivating the enzyme [86,87].\n\nInitially observed in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b cell-free extracts [88], and Methanomonas  methanooxidans microbial  culture  [89],  the  addition  of  phosphate  resulted  in methanol  accumulation  attributed  to  MDH  inhibition.  Complete  inhibition  of  MDH  has  been observed  in  cell-free  extracts  of M.  trichosporium at  150  mM  phosphate  [88],  with  120  mM\n\npMMO\n\nNAD*\n\nCH,OH\n\nphosphate concentration offering maximum inhibition in whole-cell suspensions of M. trichosporium [90]. At a concentration of 80 mM phosphate ions, 80% of the MDH activity was inhibited,  however  this  was  found  to  simultaneously  reduce  MMO  activity  by  16%,  and  FDH  by 20%  [90]. Extracellular accumulation of methanol  has been maximised  using  a phosphate concentration  of  400  mM,  generating  0.96  g/L  methanol  using  a  relatively  high  cell  density  of 17.3  g  dry  cell  L -1 ,  after  43  hours  [79].  Using  a  mixed  microbial  culture,  Han  et  al.  observed maximum methanol production, and highest methane-to-methanol conversion ratio, at a phosphate concentration  of  40  mM  [91].  Inhibition  with  phosphate  was  found  to  be  fully  reversible,  with enzyme  activity  completely  restored  after  washing  of  the  cells  with  low  concentration  phosphate buffer [90]. The inhibition mode of phosphate on MDH was found to be uncompetitive, suggesting phosphate binds to a site on the enzyme or enzyme-substrate complex other than the active site [90].\n\nA sodium chloride concentration of 300 mM has been shown to inhibit 100% of MHD activity in M.  trichosporium OB3b,  while  also  reducing  pMMO  activity  by  50%  [92].  Under  an  optimal concentration of 200 mM sodium chloride, 7 mM methanol accumulated after 36 hours, compared with  no  methanol  accumulation  under  the  same  conditions  in  an  absence  of  salt  [92].  In  a methanotroph based consortia, maximum methanol accumulation of 0.5 mmol was observed with an optimum 100 mM sodium chloride concentration, in addition to a conversion ratio of almost 80% [91].\n\nElectron microscopy has shown that at concentrations above 100 mM, sodium chloride disrupts cell  structure  and,  significantly,  the  intracytoplasmic  membrane  where  pMMO  is  found  [93]. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  (EDTA)  also  inhibits  MDH  activity,  through  chelation  of  metals present  in  the  enzyme,  and  is  not  known  to  impact  cell  morphology  [87].  Kim  et  al.  used  a combination of sodium chloride and EDTA, thus allowing reduced sodium chloride concentrations but maintaining MDH inhibition. The study demonstrated that the combination of 1 mM EDTA and 100  mM sodium chloride  was  optimal  for  methanol  production  [93].  At  higher  concentrations  of EDTA, methanol production was reduced, attributed to inhibition of MMO. The efficiency of lone EDTA  as  an  MHD  inhibitor  was  much  lower  compared  with  other  inhibitors.  An  optimal concentration of 50 µ M in a mixed methanotroph consortia produced methanol at a conversion rate of just 43% [91].\n\nAmmonium  chloride  is  also  known  as  an  MDH  inhibitor,  inducing  maximum  methane-tomethanol conversion of 80%, and optimal methanol accumulation at a concentration of 40 mM in a mixed microbial culture [91].", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/193", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 15, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 217.79604394531248, "r": 544.444, "b": 141.04404394531252, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/194", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 15, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 134.80804394531253, "r": 544.528, "b": 74.66104394531249, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/195", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 15, "bbox": {"l": 116.56468550340911, "t": 768.5867106564236, "r": 139.21153865026224, "b": 760.5867106564236, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/196", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 15, "bbox": {"l": 103.90909115887239, "t": 699.9200440036459, "r": 123.89160864138985, "b": 693.9200440036459, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/197", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 15, "bbox": {"l": 207.75499199153862, "t": 828.1043449200795, "r": 236.52298008978983, "b": 817.7357428031768, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/201", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 16, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 765.6360439453125, "r": 547.6, "b": 589.2640439453126, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/202", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 16, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 583.0360439453125, "r": 544.54, "b": 489.6640439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/203", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 16, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 483.4360439453125, "r": 544.54, "b": 307.0640439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/204", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 16, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 300.7760439453125, "r": 544.164, "b": 257.26404394531255, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "4.2.2.

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.4.1. Formate addition]\nThe addition of external metabolic electron donors to the reaction media overcomes this issue, allowing  continued  production  of  methanol.  Formate  is  a  preferred  choice  as  a  downstream metabolite  of  the  process  of  interest,  employed  in  the  majority  of  studies  [79,80,83,85,92,93,96,98,99]. Formate added to the reaction mixture is oxidised by FDH in the cell, generating an electron and carbon dioxide. Mehta et al . [98] were first to demonstrate the restoration of methanol synthesis by formate  addition  through  regeneration  of  NADH2.  The  rate  of  methanol  synthesis  in  an  MDH inhibited methanotroph culture was observed to fall off after 6 h, attributed to depletion of reducing equivalents, and the addition of 40 mM sodium formate to the reaction mixture restored biocatalytic activity  to  the  previous  level.  Takeguchi  et  al.  reported  methanol  accumulation  in  MHD  inhibited M.  trichosporium OB3b  increased  with  increasing  sodium  formate  concentration  in  the  reaction media up to a maximum 14.3 mmol/L [85].\n\nIn a study to establish the optimal reaction conditions for methanol synthesis, varying sodium formate concentration was investigated [92]. In agreement with Takeguchi et al., methanol synthesis increased with sodium formate addition, although an optimum concentration of 20 mM formate was determined  above  which  there  was  no  increase  in  methanol  accumulation.  In  conflict  however, Duan  et  al. found  that under  the reaction  conditions  employed,  increased  sodium  formate concentrations between 10 and 80 mM resulted in almost equivalent maximum methanol production, and  the  accumulation  rate  decreased  with  increasing  formate  concentration  [79].  This  lead  to  the suggestion that to maximise rate of methanol synthesis, formate should be added to the media at low concentrations throughout reaction.\n\nThe  effect  on  methanol  synthesis  of  supplementing  the  microbial  culture  with  formate throughout reaction was investigated by Pen et al.. In a culture where maximum methanol synthesis had been achieved, and oxidation activity dropped off, the addition of 20 mM sodium formate did not restart bacterial activity. This suggests that once lost, methane oxidation activity is irreversible. When formate was added whilst the bacteria were still active, an adverse effect was observed. The methanol production rate immediately dropped off compared with a culture without formate addition, and a lower total methanol concentration was achieved (50 mg/L compared with 120 mg/L) [96].\n\nIt  is  believed  that  sodium  formate  can  be  used  by  the  cell  in  the  serine  pathway  for  carbon fixation.  This  process  would  compete  with  NADH  regeneration,  with  the  two  processes  in equilibrium,  and  could  explain  the  noted  trend  in  increased  methanol  production  with  formate addition [96].", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/227", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 18, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 400.3760439453125, "r": 547.48, "b": 224.0840439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/228", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 18, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 217.79604394531248, "r": 547.48, "b": 74.66404394531253, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/232", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 19, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 765.6360439453125, "r": 544.54, "b": 655.6840439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/233", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 19, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 649.3960439453125, "r": 544.468, "b": 589.2640439453126, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "4.4.1.

Using poly-β-hydroxybutyrate cellular energy store]\nIn addition to NADH as a direct source of reducing equivalents, the ability of the cell to store energy in the form of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) has been considered. PHB is a lipid, produced and accumulated as an intracellular carbon and energy storage molecule by a variety of microorganisms  in  response  to  stress  conditions,  and  undergoes  metabolism  releasing  reducing equivalents  when  standard  energy  sources  are  not  available  [100].  PHB  accumulation  has  been observed in methanotrophic bacteria [27,28,101], and is known to be synthesised by the RuMP and serine pathways in response to nitrogen, phosphate and oxygen limitation [100]. PHB production is believed  to  be  mainly  non-growth  associated,  with  maximum  accumulation  occurring  during  late\n\ngrowth  and  early  stationary  phases  [102].

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.4.5. Cell integrity]\nIt  has  been  demonstrated,  that  the  addition  of  high  concentrations  of  sodium  chloride  as  an MDH inhibitor has a negative impaction on cell integrity and methane oxidation ability by disrupting the  structure  of  intracytoplasmic  membranes  [93].  This  discovery  prompted  investigation  into alternative MDH inhibitors that do not negatively impact cell morphology.\n\nPen et al. employed flow cytometry to investigate the integrity of the bacterial culture before and after a methanol production experiment. At the beginning of the experiment, 81% of cells were viable, with damaged cells constituting 5% of the bacterial population, which dropped to 41% viable and 38% dead after 48 h methanol production [96]. Loss in methane oxidation ability of the cells is believed to be related to loss in cell membrane integrity. Despite the presence of 41% viable cells, the oxidation activity loss was measured as 97%, which indicated that the loss of biocatalytic activity of the cells was due to both cell death and an alternative mechanism [96].\n\nPen et al. noted that the proportion of viable cells halved and the bacterial concentration was reduced  by  23%  after  48  h  of  methanol  synthesis.  The  reduction  in  optical  density  (OD) measurements was attributed to cell lysis and absorption of bacteria onto the bioreactor [96]. Cell lysis would result in the release of MMO enzymes from the cell into the reaction media. However, the  low  stability  and  activity  of  MMO  isolates  suggest  the  catalytic  contribution  from  these  to  be minimal.\n\nThe  effect  of  fresh  biocatalyst  addition  during  the  methane  oxidation  process  has  also  been investigated and is surprisingly shown to have a negative impact on methanol production. After 22 h, at the point of loss in methanol oxidation activity, addition of fresh methanotroph culture to double the total biocatalyst concentration, showed  a  sudden  and  strong decrease in the  methanol concentration, with 70% of the produced methanol lost after a further 24 h [96]. Biocatalyst addition at  a  stage  whilst  the  bacteria  were  still  viable  and  activity  high,  also  resulted  in  methanol consumption  by  the  bacteria,  even  in  the  presence  of  MDH  inhibitors.  The  explanation  for  this previously  unreported  phenomenon  is  that  the  accumulated  methanol  gives  rise  to  configuration changes on the PQQ group, restoring the ability for electron transfer from PQQ to cytochrome CL, ultimately overriding the sodium chloride MDH inhibition and restoring methanol oxidation [96].", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/248", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 20, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 267.59604394531254, "r": 544.516, "b": 207.4640439453126, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/249", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 20, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 201.17604394531259, "r": 544.528, "b": 91.22404394531259, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/253", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 21, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 765.6360439453125, "r": 544.504, "b": 672.3040439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/254", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 21, "bbox": {"l": 53.88, "t": 666.0160439453125, "r": 544.54, "b": 506.28404394531253, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "4.4.5.

It  is  well  known  that  natural  methanotrophic populations exist in symbiotic communities with a range of organisms, including a variety of alkane oxidising organisms able to utilise both C1 and ≥C2 substrates [116]. It is believed that within such situations methanotrophs are able to selectively utilise methane whilst potentially toxic ≥C2 alkanes are removed by other bacterial species. Of the methanotrophic strains identified, only those of the genus Methylocella are able to grow on substrates containing C-C bonds [48,117,118], in contrast to numerous bacteria that are capable of growth on linear alkanes C2-C9 but not methane [113].\n\nHan et al. were the first to investigate methanol production using a mixed culture consortium from a natural environment [91].

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.6.5. Bacterial strain]\nTo  date Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  has  been  the  preferred  methanotroph  species  for investigation  into  the  potential  for  a  biocatalytic  partial  methane  oxidation  process,  aided  by  the wealth  of  characterisation  data  available.  The  application  of  alternative  species,  in  particular extremophilic and extremotolerant methanotrophs, able to either thrive or tolerate living in extreme environments,  offers  huge  potential  in  terms  of  maximising  methanol  yield  through  process efficiencies.\n\nThe use of psychrophilic methanotrophs, capable of growth at low temperatures, would be well suited  to  tackling  gas-liquid  mass  transfer  limitations.  The  solubility  of  methane  increases  with\n\ndecreasing  temperature,  however  this  is  currently  constrained  in  methanol  biosynthesis  by  the optimum  temperature  of M.  trichosporium OB3b  which  is  30  ° C.  A  number  of  psychrophilic methanotrophs  have  been  identified  and  isolated  from  a  range  of  low  temperature  ecosystems including Siberian tundra bogs, Antarctic lakes, and bottom sediments and water from Pacific and Atlantic Oceans [123]. The potential of such species in an industrial process is limited as the rates of in  vivo methane  oxidation  and in  vitro metabolic  activity  have  been  demonstrated  to  decrease significantly as the temperature is lowered from 30 ° C to 5 ° C [124].\n\nMMO  isolated  from  thermophilic  methanotrophs  has  the  potential  to  be  better  suited  to industrial process conditions, offering increased stability under high temperature reaction conditions which  would  promote  increased  reaction  rates.  Tolerance  and  active  growth  of  such  species  in environments of elevated temperatures suggests development of metabolic systems to survive under these extreme conditions. Isolated and characterised by Bodrossy et al . , strain HB was isolated from Japanese  and  Hungarian  hot  springs,  capable  of  growth  at  temperatures  up  to  70  ° C  [32]. Representing a new genus, the name 'Methylothermus' was proposed, however this organism was not extensively characterised and is no longer extant. With investigation prompted by loss of the HB strain,  the  only  truly  thermophilic  methanotroph  currently  known  is  strain  MYHT,  described  as Methylothermus  thermalis .

{"chunk": "[Section: 6. Conclusion]\nmethanol\n\nPotential strategies:\n\n- Reactor design\n\n- Addition of 'Methane vectors'\n\n- MDH inhibitors\n\nMethane is an abundant natural resource used in the generation of heat and electrical power. Most notably, methane is extracted from geological fossil deposits. A significant proportion of these are  identified  as  stranded  methane  deposits.  GTL technologies are being developed as a means to exploit these remote, often diffuse sources. An additional and often undervalued resource is methane produced during anaerobic digestion that results in large volumes released as a waste product from numerous industrial processes. Consequently atmospheric methane concentrations are at unprecedented levels that, as a potent greenhouse gas, are a major cause for concern. This has led to the instigation of various methane abatement schemes.\n\nGTL technologies offer the opportunity to convert methane into a liquid hydrocarbon fuel that is more  readily  handled  and  transported  than  the  gas  precursor.  Of  the  range  of  possible  products, methanol  is  considered  an  attractive  option  with  the  potential  for  a  'methanol  economy'  to  fulfil both  the  energy  and  hydrocarbon  feedstock  demands  currently  satisfied  by  fossil  fuels.  The commercial production of methanol from methane is an energy intensive two-step process.\n\nA direct, single-step oxidation would be an attractive option with the potential for energy and cost  savings.  Methanotrophic  bacteria  utilise  powerful  MMO  enzymes  to  perform  the  desired reaction with a high level of selectivity under mild conditions. It is proposed that the methanotroph catalysed oxidation of methane to methanol is a potential GTL technology. The advantages of such a process are the low energy and cost requirements; suitability for small scale, modular processes thus allowing use of diffuse and remote gas sources; and the contribution towards methane abatement.\n\nFigure  6  summarises  the  five  main  challenges  faced  in  developing  an  industrially  relevant biocatalytic methane oxidation process, and the potential strategies to overcome these.\n\nRelatively slow growth and the inability to obtain high cell density cultures is attributed to low methane solubility being a growth limiting factor. This can be addressed through process and reactor\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\ndesign to allow optimised gas-liquid mass transfer. In terms of methanol synthesis, the first problem arises as methanol is not the final product in the oxidation of methane, but a precursor used by the cell to generate electrons and synthesise various essential metabolites. For this reason, it is necessary to inhibit the MDH enzyme, which results in the accumulation of methanol but also causes depletion of cellular reducing equivalents. It is possible to provide exogenous electrons to the biocatalyst from a number of sources, although partial suppression of MDH, rather than complete inhibition, allows a portion  of  methanol  to  be  fully  oxidised  and  so  exploits  the  cell's  natural  regeneration  pathways. Additionally,  methanol  is  toxic  to  most  methanotroph  strains  and  so  must  be  removed  from  the reaction medium before growth and methanol synthesis is affected. Implementation of ISPR methods in the initial  process  design  avoids  biocatalyst  poisoning  whilst  also  maximising  methanol production yields. Although the low specificity of the MMO enzymes is one of the factors that give methanotrophs such potential for applications in biotechnological processes, it presents a complication in biocatalysis of methane. The co-oxidation of contaminants in the feedstock methane gas  are  further  metabolised  generating  toxic  by-products  that  accumulate  within  the  cell,  causing death and loss of biocatalytic activity. It is proposed that use of either natural or synthetic microbial consortia  will  overcome  this,  mimicking  natural  conditions  where  methanotrophs  are  able  to selectively utilise methane whilst potentially toxic compounds are removed by other bacterial species that utilise higher hydrocarbons. As new strains of methanotrophs are constantly being discovered, isolated  and  characterised,  this  also  offers  potential  to  identify  extremophilic  species  that  may address some of the identified challenges. It is believed that continued progress in these areas will ultimately  allow  the  development  of  a  technically  feasible  and  economically  viable  methanotroph bioconversion of methane to methanol.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/323", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 39.270920937037, "t": 738.6791174819949, "r": 79.93213532408943, "b": 729.8276369979862, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/324", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 140.5131008742982, "t": 816.5867105310268, "r": 237.74017511010607, "b": 805.2533771976935, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/325", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 145.8406118731441, "t": 791.2533771853125, "r": 208.43886514825329, "b": 781.9200438519792, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/326", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 146.14583860554293, "t": 782.2533772226046, "r": 266.8749984979292, "b": 771.9200438892713, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/327", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 147.172489915393, "t": 743.9200439536459, "r": 213.7663763782751, "b": 736.5867106203125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/328", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 54.0, "t": 726.9360439453126, "r": 544.42, "b": 611.5840439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/329", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 54.0, "t": 606.9160439453126, "r": 544.408, "b": 536.5840439453125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/330", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 54.0, "t": 531.9160439453126, "r": 544.408, "b": 446.58404394531254, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/331", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 54.0, "t": 441.91604394531254, "r": 544.28, "b": 416.56404394531256, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/333", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 54.0, "t": 107.31604394531257, "r": 544.268, "b": 81.98404394531258, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/334", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 21.310043706968703, "t": 746.5867104897569, "r": 31.299126676401016, "b": 731.9200438230903, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/335", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 21.975982493904656, "t": 706.5867107230903, "r": 30.63318773407933, "b": 693.2533773897569, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/336", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 20.644104736899568, "t": 664.5867105828125, "r": 31.299126570960706, "b": 650.5867105828125, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/337", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 30, "bbox": {"l": 21.975982571597527, "t": 622.586710500868, "r": 30.6331878117722, "b": 609.2533771675347, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/341", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 31, "bbox": {"l": 54.0, "t": 765.9360439453126, "r": 544.42, "b": 440.58404394531254, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "6.
