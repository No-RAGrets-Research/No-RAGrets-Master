{"chunk": "[Section: Abstract]\nAs one of the most potent greenhouse gases, methane is a critical target for the near-term mitigation of global warming. Efficient, scalable, easy-to-implement, and robust mitigation technologies are urgently needed to assist in reaching methane abolishment. The goal of this research was to test the applicability of active, extremophilic methanotrophic cells as a baseline concept for engineered systems aiming at methane capturing. The system, named living emission abolish filters (LEAFs), represents an array of immobilized biomaterials capable of capturing methane directly from vent streams. The biomaterials were made using cells of Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z R , a robust halophilic methanotrophic bacterium with the ability to consume methane gas at low concentrations. Several critical parameters were tested, including (i) the composition of the matrix and optimal immobilization to increase catalyst load, (ii) the stability of methanotrophic cells, and (iii) the toxicity of trace gases (i.e. CO). We found that hydrogels coated with 2.3 mg cell dry weight/cm 3 methanotrophic cells represent the best-performing biomaterials. The methane reduction potential of LEAFs fluctuated from 20% to 95% and depended on the methane concentration in the gas stream and the stream flow rates. The potential for commercial-scale deployment and emissions reductions was also evaluated. Total greenhouse gas emissions (combined using the global warming potential GWP100) from an example using a ventilation air methane source over a one-year period was shown to be reduced in two LEAF scenarios by 51% and 75%. Over longer time horizons, more significant reductions are possible as consistent methane consumption can be sustained. The study highlights the overall potential of the liquid-free bio-based composite methane mitigation system. Further improvements essential for system assembly and implementations should include (a) optimization of the cell immobilization protocols to improve cell load and the shelf-life of the system and (b) implementation of matrix moldings for cell immobilization to achieve optimal gas flow and increase the cell-gas interface.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/37", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 119.055, "t": 515.3640146484375, "r": 551.142, "b": 194.5250146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "Abstract", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "As one of the most potent greenhouse gases, methane is a critical target for the near-term mitigation of global warming.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 120, "document_start": 1680, "document_end": 1800, "length": 120}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "Efficient, scalable, easy-to-implement, and robust mitigation technologies are urgently needed to assist in reaching methane abolishment.", "char_start": 121, "char_end": 258, "document_start": 1801, "document_end": 1938, "length": 137}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "The goal of this research was to test the applicability of active, extremophilic methanotrophic cells as a baseline concept for engineered systems aiming at methane capturing.", "char_start": 259, "char_end": 434, "document_start": 1939, "document_end": 2114, "length": 175}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "The system, named living emission abolish filters (LEAFs), represents an array of immobilized biomaterials capable of capturing methane directly from vent streams.", "char_start": 435, "char_end": 598, "document_start": 2115, "document_end": 2278, "length": 163}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "The biomaterials were made using cells of Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z R , a robust halophilic methanotrophic bacterium with the ability to consume methane gas at low concentrations.", "char_start": 599, "char_end": 790, "document_start": 2279, "document_end": 2470, "length": 191}, {"sentence_id": 5, "text": "Several critical parameters were tested, including (i) the composition of the matrix and optimal immobilization to increase catalyst load, (ii) the stability of methanotrophic cells, and (iii) the toxicity of trace gases (i.e. CO).", "char_start": 791, "char_end": 1022, "document_start": 2471, "document_end": 2702, "length": 231}, {"sentence_id": 6, "text": "We found that hydrogels coated with 2.3 mg cell dry weight/cm 3 methanotrophic cells represent the best-performing biomaterials.", "char_start": 1023, "char_end": 1151, "document_start": 2703, "document_end": 2831, "length": 128}, {"sentence_id": 7, "text": "The methane reduction potential of LEAFs fluctuated from 20% to 95% and depended on the methane concentration in the gas stream and the stream flow rates.", "char_start": 1152, "char_end": 1306, "document_start": 2832, "document_end": 2986, "length": 154}, {"sentence_id": 8, "text": "The potential for commercial-scale deployment and emissions reductions was also evaluated.", "char_start": 1307, "char_end": 1397, "document_start": 2987, "document_end": 3077, "length": 90}, {"sentence_id": 9, "text": "Total greenhouse gas emissions (combined using the global warming potential GWP100) from an example using a ventilation air methane source over a one-year period was shown to be reduced in two LEAF scenarios by 51% and 75%.", "char_start": 1398, "char_end": 1621, "document_start": 3078, "document_end": 3301, "length": 223}, {"sentence_id": 10, "text": "Over longer time horizons, more significant reductions are possible as consistent methane consumption can be sustained.", "char_start": 1622, "char_end": 1741, "document_start": 3302, "document_end": 3421, "length": 119}, {"sentence_id": 11, "text": "The study highlights the overall potential of the liquid-free bio-based composite methane mitigation system.", "char_start": 1742, "char_end": 1850, "document_start": 3422, "document_end": 3530, "length": 108}, {"sentence_id": 12, "text": "Further improvements essential for system assembly and implementations should include (a) optimization of the cell immobilization protocols to improve cell load and the shelf-life of the system and (b) implementation of matrix moldings for cell immobilization to achieve optimal gas flow and increase the cell-gas interface.", "char_start": 1851, "char_end": 2175, "document_start": 3531, "document_end": 3855, "length": 324}], "sentence_count": 13, "document_offsets": {"start": 1660, "end": 3855}}
{"chunk": "[Section: 1. Introduction]\nGreenhouse gases (GHGs), mostly CO2, methane and nitrous oxide, are the main drivers of climate change. The emission of all GHGs needs to be targeted but reducing methane emissions would bring the biggest benefits in a short-time frame. Methane has a global warming potential (GWP100) 27-30 times stronger than CO2, meaning that 1 kg of emitted methane has 27-30 more climate effect than 1 kg of CO2 in a 100 year time frame [1, 2]. Removing atmospheric methane and reducing anthropogenic methane emissions by 30% is one of the ambitious but urgently needed tasks for slowing climate-change progression. Methane emissions come from a variety of sources, ranging from small dairy farms to\n\nParameters optimized:\n\n• Medium\n\n• Carbon substrate\n\n• Cell density\n\n• O,/CH, supply\n\nFermentation\n\nParameters optimized:\n\n• Cell preparation protocol\n\n• Matrix saturation\n\nParameters tested:\n\n• Gas flow\n\n• CO impacts large coal mines, challenging the concept of a universal methane mitigation system [3]. Over the last few decades, scientists have been developing various methane-capturing strategies, including several biological solutions [4].\n\nBiology plays an important role in the global methane cycle, contributing to both methane production and methane oxidation [5]. Microbial methane utilization has been found in aerobic and anaerobic environments [5]. Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria, also known as methanotrophs, drive methane oxidation using oxygen-dependent enzymes [6]. Methanotrophs are the commonly used platforms for engineering bio-based systems that aim at methane capturing and oxidation. Most bio-based designs are centered on reinforcing activities of natural microbes toward higher methane fluxes [7]. Efficiency, simplicity in operation, and system cost are among the main challenges remaining.\n\nImmobilization of methanotrophic microbes has been attempted over the last 20 years in order to identify a novel filtration system for methane [4]. Over these past few decades scientists have been trying to determine the most efficient matrix to immobilize methanotrophic bacteria by testing: natural soil, alginate, clay pellets, fly ash ceramsite, perlite compost, concrete, coal, compost, polyethylene rings, activated carbon, plastic bio-balls, gravel, sponge, wood chips, bark mulch, and glass fiber filters [8-17]. Thedesign of most of these filtration systems typically includes immobilized cells on a specified substrate with mixed gas entering from one side and flowing through the system to exit through the opposite side. Methane-consuming bacteria in these filtration models are supplied with liquid mineral media continuously, typically using a nutrient recycling pump that has temperature regulation and the ability for sludge removal. The general idea for such biofiltration systems is to capture methane emissions and convert them into CO2, with minimal biomass production to prevent the system from bio-clogging. However, keeping microbes in an active methane utilization stage with limited biomass production is challenging and often results in an unstable system.\n\nMicrobial methane oxidation provides cell carbon, energy, and water release by two pathways:\n\nQ1. CH4 + 2O2 = CO2 + 2H2O (oxidationenergy)\n\nQ2. CH4 + O2 = CH2O + H2O (assimilationbiomass).\n\nThe ratio between the pathways will differ in response to nutrient availability or environmental conditions (e.g. pH/salinity/temperature or oxidative stress). About 50% of the methane consumed is oxidized. Environmental stressors (high or low pH, salinity, and temperature) will shift the methane flux toward oxidation for energy generation. Theoretical\n\npredictions suggest that active methane consumption could supply up to 80% of the cellular water requirements in microbial species isolated from environments with low water availability. This research aimed to construct and assess a novel design, showcased in figure 1, named living emission abolish filters (LEAFs) for eliminating methane from coal mine ventilation without the need for outside intervention. The objective for the design of LEAFs was to eliminate the need for external nutrient supplementation, temperature regulation, and sludge removal which has been critical for previous models. The methanotrophic microbe used for testing LEAFs was Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum ( M.alcaliphilum ) 20Z R , chosen for its robustness in thriving at high salinities and pH levels. These qualities were sought after due to the unique ability of LEAF's halophilic methanotrophs to sustain dryness, while preserving high methane oxidation rates. The ability of immobilized cells to stay active at solid-gas interphase enables construction of a simple cartridge-like system, which does not require nutrient recycling or water addition.

We collected gas consumption rates daily (glass, filter paper, and sponge) or every other day (SAP) and represented them as an average for each matrix. Methane consumption rates (i.e. activity) and duration of the active stage (i.e. stability) varied between matrices as shown in figure 2(B). All consumption data was normalized by gram cell dry weight (gCDW) which is a calculation previously identified to be 0.34 gCDW in 1 l of cells with an optical density (OD600) of 1. Very poor activity ( ∼ 0.5-1 mmol CH4 d -1 gCDW -1 ) and stability (up to 2 d) were observed for cells immobilized on glass. Cells immobilized on more absorbent substrates (sponge and filter paper) consumed methane for 2-4 d with the highest consumption at 63 mmol CH4 d -1 gCDW -1 on day 1 and 25 mmol CH4 d -1 gCDW -1 on day 4. Cells imbedded onto the SAP made of hydrogel displayed the highest methane consumption rates, 31-155 mmol CH4 d -1 gCDW -1 for 7-11 d on average in a closed system. To further evaluate cell adhesion to the surface of the SAP matrix, several beads from the SAP matrix were removed from the experiment with immobilized M. alcaliphilum 20Z R cells were removed from the experiment for use in scanning electron microscopy (SEM). After fixing and mounting the SAP matrix, micrographs were captured of its surface, gradually increasing magnification from top to bottom (figure 2(C)).

Overall, the larger unit consumed similar fractions of the inlet methane at lower gas flow rates similar to the data derived from the benchtop units. When the gas flow was increased the units consumed a lower fraction of the inlet load but at a higher rate per hour. These data exemplify that the unit can be scaled up from 120 cm 3 to 1840 cm 3 with comparable results.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/119", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6,

{"chunk": "[Section: 3. Discussion]\nTo evaluate LEAF's efficiency, we compared them to previous biofiltration systems (supplementary materials, table S1). The table was integrated from a methane biofiltration review paper with our results transformed to the same units of gCH4 m -3 d -1 [4]. The data from LEAFs can be compared to all other systems by size (120 cm 3 , 5 tandem 120 cm 3 , and 1840 cm 3 ), gas flow rates (0.64-28 l hr -1 ), and methane inlet loads (3.7-8967 gCH4 m -3 d -1 ) [25-64]. Each previous filtration unit was tested for different applications and conditions with either new nutrients continually being added to decrease dryness, culture enrichment, temperature regulation, or cell debris removal. In contrast, LEAFs can operate for > 5 months without\n\nany additional supplementation and yet show the highest methane reduction potential.\n\nHere we evaluate LEAFs as a prototype of a cheap, simple, scalable, cartridge-like systems for capturing methane. The system does not require water, eliminating challenges associated with the limitations of gasto-liquid transfer, and thus, LEAFs could represent a transformative solution for microbial methane utilization. Operational parameters of LEAFs are expected to be similar to techniques applied for air purification technologies. LEAF units have potential to be applied to a variety of sources with high to low methane inlet concentration loads at a variety of flow rates. The system has yet to be tested at atmospheric methane concentrations of 1.9 ppm ( ∼ 0.0002%), but a recent study has emerged demonstrating that in liquid culture Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense 5GB1 was able to grow and consume methane at 200 ppm ( ∼ 0.02%) exhibiting the possibilities of using methanotrophic bacteria to mitigate atmospheric methane [65].\n\nKey experimental parameters developed during the study were integrated into a life cycle assessment study to further evaluate the applicability of the technology for large scale deployment at methaneemission sources, such as coal mines or cattle barns. Significant greenhouse gas emission reductions are predicted to be possible, even with current versions of the technology, if deployed to oxidize methane from coal mine ventilation gas sources. A typical emissions scenario for coal mine ventilation air was used as a test case, with a measured methane concentration of 0.65% and a gas flow rate of 200 m 3 s -1 . Three scenarios were evaluated where the VAM was either allowed to be released into the atmosphere with no controls, or was routed through commercial scale LEAFs reflecting the design and performance of either the single large 1840 cm 3 reactor design or the series of 5 smaller 120 cm 3 reactors. Nutrient requirements were modeled after the media broth used in lab scale designs, and other inputs were developed in consultation with mining industry contacts. Greenhouse gas emissions from an example VAM source over a one-year period was shown to be reduced in two LEAF scenarios by 51% and 75%. Over longer time horizons, more significant reductions are possible, as consistent methane consumption can be sustained.\n\nThe study also highlights a set of additional optimizations, including cell preparations and immobilization. All data generated for this report are based on matrixes prepared immediately after fermentation and biomass separation. However, we recognize that an efficient procedure for catalyst preservation (alone or imbedded into matrix) remains to be solved for scale-up applications. Additional variables that still need to be examined are increasing the maximum cell load of the units, creating a protocol to print 3D constructs to decrease pressure build up, and increasing the porosity of the system to allow for an increase in the number of cells that come into contact with methane.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/161", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 341.883, "t": 226.13401464843753, "r": 552.761, "b": 54.23401464843755, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/165", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 119.055, "t": 779.8490146484376, "r": 329.923, "b": 757.9490146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/166", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 119.055, "t": 754.8490146484376, "r": 329.937, "b": 532.9490146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/167", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 119.055, "t": 529.8490146484376, "r": 329.933, "b": 195.44901464843747, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/168", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 119.055, "t": 192.34901464843756, "r": 329.937, "b": 45.44901464843747, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}, {"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 341.883, "t": 779.8490146484376, "r": 552.761, "b": 757.9490146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "3.

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.5. Life cycle assessment (LCA)]\nThe LCA study was conducted in accordance with ISO guidelines [67]. A model VAM gas stream being emitted over a time period of 1 year was used to represent the methane control system boundary of interest, using parameters from Su et al [68] of a VAM stream examined in Australia, with a methane concentration of < 0.65% (vol.) and a VAM flow rate of 200 m 3 s -1 . In the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario, uncontrolled release of this VAM gas stream was assumed to occur for the one-year time horizon. In Scenario 2, a commercial-scale LEAF reactor was assumed to be used to control methane research with performance characteristics similar to those in Row 6 of table 2, the 1840 cm 3 unit capable of oxidizing 64% of input methane into carbon dioxide at 316.2 g m -3 day. These reactor performance metrics were scaled to size a reactor capable of handling the methane flow assumed in this study. Scenario 3 represented a different LEAF reactor configuration analogous to row 3 of table 2, where 5 smaller LEAFs reactors in series were capable of oxidizing 84% of a higher-volume methane stream at 1% CH4, even though the total reactor volume was ∼ 3X less than the larger LEAF reactor used as a model for Scenario 2. Nutrient media was added with a composition identical to that described in section 4.1, with 800 kg water and 70 kg poly(methyl methacrylate) media for SAP beads used per m 3 of reactor volume. Reactor contents were assumed to be completely recharged every 6 months, to maintain the growth conditions\n\nfor the bacteria. In addition to reactor media, some supplemental utilities were provided to the system to account for continued VAM system performance. Based on consultations with a colleague in the coal mining industry, it was assumed that power requirements for maintaining equivalent VAM gas flow would be increased by 10% to account for the minor VAM gas obstruction presented by the LEAF reactor, adding 5.4 million kWh of electricity use per year in each scenario. Estimated power consumption was calculated by taking known VAM gas flow power consumption from a coal mine within the same region, and linearly scaling to the match the flow rate used in this study. No supplemental heating or cooling was assumed to be provided to the LEAF reactor, assuming that VAM gas temperature was sufficient to meet the needs of the reactor. In different parts of the world, using different methane gas sources, this assumption may need to be revisited with additional LCA work. LCA modeling was performed in SimaPro, version 9.4, using items from the ecoinvent V3database [69] used to represent inputs to the study. The ecoinvent profile for medium-voltage Australian electricity was updated with the grid mix from 2022, with an emissions impact of 708 g CO2eq/ kWh [70]. Global Warming Potential was assessed for each scenario using the IPCC 2021 100 year GWP method, where methane has a GWP value of 29.8.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/186", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 341.883, "t": 432.7760146484375, "r": 552.766, "b": 60.87601464843749, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/190", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 11, "bbox": {"l": 119.055, "t": 779.8490146484376, "r": 329.933, "b": 432.9490146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "4.5.
