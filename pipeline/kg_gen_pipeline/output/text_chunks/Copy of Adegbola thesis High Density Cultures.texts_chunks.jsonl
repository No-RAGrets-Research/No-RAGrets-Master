{"chunk": "[Section: Abstract]\nMethylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a wild type, obligate methanotroph that grows only on one-carbon compounds and, in the absence of copper, produces high levels of soluble methane  monooxygenase  (sMMO)  to  metabolize  methane  to  methanol.    SMMO  has gained a great deal of attention in the bioremediation and chemical industries because of its  low  substrate  specificity  and  its  ability  to  oxidize  chlorinated  hydrocarbons.  Much literature exists on cultivating this organism on methane, however no one has achieved dry  cell  weight  densities  exceeding  18  g/L.  Biomass  growth  is  limited  due  to  mass transfer of methane to cells. This study investigated the growth of M. trichosporium on the water soluble carbon source, methanol while retaining sMMO activity.\n\nMethanol was found to completely inhibit growth at 40 g/L. For online methanol measurements  during  fed-batch  cultivation,  an in  situ probe  was  constructed  from autoclavable materials and equipped with a Figaro TGS822 vapor sensor. The probe was designed  to  prevent  the  sensor  coming  in  contact  with  water  aerosols  which  affect  its performance.  The  probe  was  an  essential  component  of  a  feedback  methanol  control system.  The  cumulative  CO2  production  (CCP)  strategy  was  used  to  feed  methanol  in fed-batch experiments.\n\nIn an initial bioreactor study, growth nutrients were fed in excess. The yields of biomass to nutrients were determined and the growth medium modified accordingly.  A biomass density  of  19  g/L  (growth  rate  of  0.013-0.065  h -1 )  was  achieved  with  sMMO activity  of  300  to  500  [µmol  naphthol][g  of  biomass] -1 [h] -1 .  The  subsequent  bioreactor\n\nstudy  involved  feeding  of  nutrients  based  on  their  yields  in  relation  to  methanol,  a biomass density of 62 g/L (growth rate of 0.034- 0.08 h -1 ) was achieved.\n\nThe inoculum cultures utilized in the bioreactor studies were maintained on Noble agar plates  containing  nitrogen  minimal  salts  medium  and  methane.  After  6  months  of subsequent  plate  transfers, M.  trichosporium lost  the  ability  to  produce  high  levels  of sMMO. The enzyme activity in methanol grown cells was recovered by subculturing in liquid NMS medium with methane as the sole carbon source, the activity increased from 8 to 600 [µmol naphthol][g of biomass] -1 [h] -1 . It is recommended that further studies be carried out on stimulating sMMO activity during cultivation on methanol.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/6", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 680.712, "r": 543.071, "b": 450.132, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/7", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 426.312, "r": 543.05, "b": 250.93200000000002, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/8", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 227.11199999999997, "r": 543.062, "b": 134.53200000000004, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/10", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 716.832, "r": 543.0, "b": 679.452, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/11", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 655.632, "r": 543.137, "b": 480.252, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "Abstract", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a wild type, obligate methanotroph that grows only on one-carbon compounds and, in the absence of copper, produces high levels of soluble methane  monooxygenase  (sMMO)  to  metabolize  methane  to  methanol.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 247, "document_start": 288, "document_end": 535, "length": 243}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "SMMO  has gained a great deal of attention in the bioremediation and chemical industries because of its  low  substrate  specificity  and  its  ability  to  oxidize  chlorinated  hydrocarbons.", "char_start": 247, "char_end": 441, "document_start": 535, "document_end": 729, "length": 192}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "Much literature exists on cultivating this organism on methane, however no one has achieved dry  cell  weight  densities  exceeding  18  g/L.

{"chunk": "[Section: Chapter 1 Introduction]\nMethylosinus trichosporium is a Gram-negative bacterium that occurs naturally in aquatic and terrestrial environments. It is an α -proteobacterium in the family Methylocystaceae that  is  representative  of  all  Type  II  methanotrophs.  Methanotrophs  utilize  one-carbon compounds as a source of carbon and energy. Type II methanotrophs can co-metabolize a broad  range  of  substrates  due  to  their  synthesis  of  soluble  methane  monooxygenase (sMMO) which catalyzes the breakdown of methane to methanol. There are two types of methane  monooxygenase  (MMO),  the  particulate  form  (pMMO)  and  the  soluble  form (sMMO).    The  soluble  form  has  been  shown  to  possess  a  broader  range  of  substrate specificity (Colby, et al., 1977; Hanson  and  Hanson,  1996), resulting in faster degradation rates of chlorinated ethenes than the particulate form (DiSpirito et al., 1991; Oldenhuis et al., 1991).\n\nDue  to  its  low  substrate  specificity,  sMMO  has  been  studied  for  use  in  the bioremediation  industry for the degradation of a host of  contaminants  including naphthalene  (Cardinal  and  Stenstrom,  1991),  trichloroethylene  (Brusseau  et  al.,  1990; Tsien  et  al.,  1989),  dichloroethane  (Oldenhuis  et  al.,  1989),  vinyl  chloride  (Fox  et  al., 1990) and cyclopropane (Dalton et al., 1981). For instance, the degradation of trichloroethylene, a recalcitrant carcinogenic groundwater contaminant (Canadian Council  of  Ministers  of  the  Environment  2006),  is  facilitated  by  sMMO  via  an epoxidation  reaction.  The  enzyme  can  also  be  used  in  the  production  of  commercially significant epoxides such as propylene oxide (Lidstrom and Stirling, 1990).  Degradation\n\nrates  of  TCE  by  sMMO  expressing  cultures  of  M.  trichosporium  OB3b  have  been reported to be up to three orders of magnitude faster than those observed in other TCE degraders (Table 1-1).\n\nM. trichosporium OB3b is a wild type that has been shown to produce high levels of sMMO in comparison to other sMMO producers (Bowman and Sayler, 1994). Since sMMO is a growth associated enzyme, high cell density cultivation of M. trichosporium OB3b could result in increased enzyme production. An advantage of high cell densities is faster  contaminant  degradation.  A  major  problem  encountered  in  high  cell  density cultivation of this organism, is the solubility of methane in liquid medium. At high cell\n\ndensities,  the  availability  of  the  carbon  source  is  primarily  limited  by  mass  transfer  of gaseous methane to the aqueous phase. A potential solution to this problem is the use of a water  soluble  carbon  source.  Methanol  although  it  inhibits  growth  above  certain concentrations, is a good alternative due to its infinite solubility in water, and low cost. In addition, methanol is less flammable than methane and thus has less of a hazard for large scale use.\n\nThis study investigates the cultivation of M. trichosporium OB3b on methanol to achieve high biomass concentrations whilst retaining sMMO activity.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/64", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 660.612, "r": 543.281, "b": 374.892, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/65", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 357.072, "r": 543.065, "b": 126.49199999999996, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/67", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 11, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 678.912, "r": 543.036, "b": 613.932, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/69", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 11, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 252.61199999999997, "r": 543.056, "b": 104.832, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/71", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 12, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 678.912, "r": 543.06, "b": 531.132, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/72", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 12, "bbox": {"l": 108.0, "t": 513.312, "r": 543.01, "b": 475.932, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "Chapter 1 Introduction", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "Methylosinus trichosporium is a Gram-negative bacterium that occurs naturally in aquatic and terrestrial environments.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 118, "document_start": 4522, "document_end": 4640, "length": 118}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "It is an α -proteobacterium in the family Methylocystaceae that  is  representative  of  all  Type  II  methanotrophs.", "char_start": 119, "char_end": 239, "document_start": 4641, "document_end": 4761, "length": 118}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "Methanotrophs  utilize  one-carbon compounds as a source of carbon and energy.", "char_start": 239, "char_end": 317, "document_start": 4761, "document_end": 4839, "length": 78}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "Type II methanotrophs can co-metabolize a broad  range  of  substrates  due  to  their  synthesis  of  soluble  methane  monooxygenase (sMMO) which catalyzes the breakdown of methane to methanol.", "char_start": 318, "char_end": 513, "document_start": 4840, "document_end": 5035, "length": 195}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "There are two types of methane  monooxygenase  (MMO),  the  particulate  form  (pMMO)  and  the  soluble  form (sMMO).", "char_start": 514, "char_end": 636, "document_start": 5036, "document_end": 5158, "length": 118}, {"sentence_id": 5, "text": "The  soluble  form  has  been  shown  to  possess  a  broader  range  of  substrate specificity (Colby, et al., 1977;

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.2.3 Formaldehyde assimilation (serine pathway)]\nThe serine pathway (Figure 2-2) for formaldehyde assimilation is a characteristic which differentiates Type II from Type I methanotrophs.  Through a series of steps in the first half of the serine pathway, two molecules of formaldehyde and two molecules of glycine produce  two  molecules  of  phosphogylcerate.

Hence,  it  is  important  to  control  the  methanol concentration below inhibitory/toxic levels. Online methods of analyzing methanol tend to be more direct and rapid. Offline techniques such as gas chromatography (GC), high performance liquid chromatography, infrared spectroscopy and mass spectroscopy tend to be labor intensive and may require sample preparation. For instance, in order to obtain an accurate GC measurement of methanol, a liquid sample may need to be centrifuged and the supernatant mixed with a known aliquot of an internal standard before it is analyzed.\n\nA  vapor  phase  sensor  is  an  alternate  and  inexpensive  method  of  measuring methanol concentration online. These sensors detect and quantify methanol concentration in the vapor phase, which can then be related to liquid phase concentrations. The Figaro TGS822 volatile gas sensor has been widely used in the detection of alcohols. The sensor is  typically  placed  in  the  reactor  air  outlet  (Katakura  1998).

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.2.1 Sensor characterization]\nThe response time is highly dependent on the methanol vaporization rate, mass transfer rates across the silicone membrane and air flow rate through the probe. Since the rate of methanol volatilization is affected by temperature and pressure both were kept constant for  every  experiment.  Given  that  the  air  flow  rate  through  the  probe  affects  how  fast methanol vapor is delivered from the membrane chamber to the sensor, an increase in airflow was expected to decrease the response time. The effect of air flow (19, 40 and 60 mL/min)  through  the  probe  was  investigated.  A  step  change  in  liquid  methanol concentration from 1 to 2 g/L resulted in similar sensor response times (approximately 12 min)  at  each  flow  rate  (Figure  3-2).  There  was  negligible  effect  of  the  corresponding residence times at the different flow rates because the actual residence time in the probe was quite low in comparison to the overall response time. At a flow rate of 19 ml/min it takes approximately 0.5 seconds to transport methanol from the membrane chamber to the  sensor  (calculated  based  on  the  probe  length  of  1.5  ft  and  PTFE  tube  diameter  of 1/4') and 0.15 seconds at a flow rate of 60 mL/min. This indicates that the limiting factor is mass transfer across the silicone membrane. In Figures 3-2 and 3-3, it can be observed that sensitivity of the sensor output had decreased with increasing air flow rate.  A flow rate of 19 mL/min was fixed for subsequent studies.\n\nflow rates, is shown.\n\n1.3\n\n1.6\n\n1.2\n\n1.4 -\n\n1.1\n\n1.2\n\n1.0\n\n1.0\n\n0.9\n\n0.8\n\n0.8\n\n0.6\n\nSensor output (V)\n\n0\n\n0\n\n1\n\n5\n\n0-0-0-0\n\nSASsSSASs\n\n+00-30000090\n\n10\n\n15\n\nTime (min)\n\n20\n\n25\n\n2\n\n3\n\nMethanol concentration (g/L)\n\n4\n\n5\n\nThe response of the sensor to changes in methanol concentrations was not linear (Figure 3-3).  The non linearity response of the sensor was expected as sensor specifications in the manufacturer's catalog indicated a logarithmic relationship between sensor resistance and  gas  concentration  within  the  detection  limits.  The  explanation  for  the  non-linear response  of  the  sensor  has  been  provided  in  detail  elsewhere  (Figaro  Engineering  Inc. 2004;  Guarna  et  al.,  1997;  Heiland  1982;  Jones  et  al.,  1985;  Morrison  1982;  Watson 1984).  The non-linear response is due to a combination of effects. The first is a result of the  electronic  measuring  circuit  (Appendix  A)  that  makes  use  of  a  voltage  divider configuration to quantify changes in conductance of the detecting element (SnO2) which yields  a  parabolic  relationship  between  output  voltage  and  conductance.  The  second effect  is  a  result  of  the  non-linear  physical-chemical  interaction  between  the  detector, oxygen  and  methanol.  The  conductivity  of  a  sintered  semiconductor  such  as  SnO2  is primarily  affected  by  the  electrons  populating  the  surface  states.  Hence  changes  in  the availability  of  the  surface  states  alter  the  conductivity.  For  the  methanol  sensor,  in  the absence  of  methanol,  the  chemisorption  of  oxygen  depletes  the  conduction  electrons available  at  the  surface  which  lowers  the  overall  conductivity.  When  methanol  is  in contact with the detector, it adsorbs to the surface and the semiconductor catalyzes the reduction of surface-bound oxygen, producing the more weakly interacting formaldehyde that  desorbs  and  frees  surface  conduction  band  electrons  which  in  turn,  increases  the measured conductivity (Guarna et al., 1997).", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/238", "label":

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.2.2 Sensor performance]\nFigure 3-4 shows methanol concentrations determined by the sensor and the offline GC analysis over the duration of a fed-batch fermentation. The sensor provided satisfactory measurement of the methanol concentration during the course of the fed-batch fermentation until about 80 h of operation, the sensor output deviated from the offline GC analysis.  This drift in performance was also observed by (Ramon et al., 2004) during the high  cell  density  cultivation  of Pichia  pastoris .  In  the  current  study  of  the  high  cell density  cultivation  of M.  trichosporium  OB3b ,  the  airflow  through  the  bioreactor  was increased  automatically  to  maintain  the  dissolved  oxygen  level  above  40%  saturation. This increase in airflow caused a slight rise in methanol vaporization which resulted in an offset in the sensor calibration probably causing the deviation in Figure 3-4. The sensor, although  not  as  accurate  as  the  GC  analysis,  can  provide  an  adequate  method  of controlling  methanol  concentration  if  it  is  regularly  recalibrated  online.  A  one  point calibration  can  be  performed  by  using  another  method  (such  as  GC)  to  measure  the methanol concentration.\n\nMethanol concentration

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.2.2 Bioreactor studies: medium optimization]\nDue to the  intensive  labor  involved  with  carrying  out  yield  and  toxicity  studies  on  all nutrients  in  the  Higgin's  growth  medium  (Cornish  et  al.,  1984),  particularly  nutrients with  an  initial  concentration  less  than  100  ppm,  a  fed-batch  cultivation  experiment, Fermentation 1 was carried out to determine the concentration profile of nutrients over the course of the fermentation. Methanol feeding commenced once the initial methanol concentration  dropped  to  1.4  g/L.  The  biomass,  CCP  and  CMC  profiles  had  a  similar trend  (Figure  4-5).  The  initial  yield  of  carbon  dioxide  to  methanol  was  1.8  g/g  which declined to approximately 0.8 g/g for the most part of the fermentation (Figure 4-5). All other  growth  nutrients  were  fed  in  excess  over  the  course  of  the  fermentation,  the concentration profile of nutrients is shown in (Appendix C). The growth rates achieved were 0.013- 0.065 h -1 (Table 4-5), which is slightly lower than growth rates on methanol 0.063-0.086 h -1 reported by Best and Higgins (1981) and on methane 0.08 h -1 (Mehta et al., 1989; Park et al., 1991). The method of estimating the growth rates in the current fedbatch study is outlined in Appendix D. The sMMO activity (315 -502 [µmol naphthol][g of biomass] -1 [h] -1 ) is comparable to values that have been reported elsewhere (Bowman and  Sayler,  1994).  The  overall  yields  of  biomass  to  nutrients  were  estimated  from  the cumulative biomass produced and the cumulative nutrient consumption (Appendix E). A comparison of biomass yields to values from other studies is shown in Table 4-6. The methanol yield in this study (0.3 g dry cell wt/g CH3OH) is similar to those achieved in studies  by  Best  and  Higgins  (1981)  and  Fitch  et  al.,  (1996).

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.2.3 High cell density fed-batch cultivation (Fermentation 2) — Part 1]\nA fed-batch bioreactor study Fermentation 2, was carried out with medium B to achieve high cell density.  The trace nutrients in Medium B were mixed together in a concentrated solution  (Table  4-7)  and  fed  according  to  the  estimated  methanol  consumption.  The estimation  of  the  biomass  yields  from  the  nutrients  in  Fermentation  1  facilitated  the design of a trace nutrients feeding strategy based on the amount of each nutrient required for  a  corresponding  amount  of  methanol.  The  estimated  amount  of  each  trace  nutrient utilized  (Mi)  was  determined  online  based  on  the  amount  of  methanol  consumed. Equation 4-4 shows the online calculation of consumed Fe 2+ . The amount of each nutrient fed  was  then  kept  equal  to  Mi  (Figure  4-6).  Phosphate  was  fed  manually  based  on  the biomass  yield.  The  initial  methanol  concentration  in  the  bioreactor  was  2g/L.  Since higher growth rates were achieved at low methanol concentrations (Figure 4-3), feeding began  once  the  initial  methanol  concentration  decreased  to  0.4  g/L.  Sigma  SE-15  was used as the antifoam agent.\n\n(Equation 4-4)\n\nWhere  MFe 2+ is  the  estimated  total  amount  of  Fe 2+ (g)  consumed,  CMC  (g)  is  the cumulative methanol utilized and YFe 2+ /CH3OH (g/g) is the yield of Fe 2+ to methanol.\n\nSet\n\npoint\n\n=\n\nMi\n\nOn/off\n\ncontroller\n\nNutrient\n\nfeed\n\npump\n\nWeight\n\nbalance\n\nTotal\n\nnutrient\n\nfed\n\nDuring the early growth phase, cells of M. trichosporium OB3b have a high demand for CO2.  Therefore  CO2  (3.5  ±  0.05%)  was  supplied  in  the  air  stream  to  the  bioreactor. However in the exponential growth phase, similar growth rates were observed in batch cultures grown with and without external CO2 supply (Park et al., 1991). In that study, biomass growth was in the exponential phase at a cell density of approximately 0.3 g/L, hence in this study the supplemental CO2 was discontinued once the biomass exceeded 1g/L.\n\nBiomass, CCP and CMC profiles from Fermentation 2 are shown in Figure 4-7. Approximately  62  g/L  of  biomass  was  produced.  This  is  the  highest  cell  density  ever reported  for  the  cultivation  of M. trichosporium OB3b .    The  previous  highest  biomass density was 18 g/L by Shah et al., (1996). Biomass productivity, 0.44 g/L-h was three times higher in Fermentation 2 (Table 4-5 and 4-8), indicating a significant improvement in cultivation conditions. Methanol in Fermentation 1 was controlled at 1.4 g/L and at 0.4 g/L in Fermentation 2, thus a weaker methanol inhibitory effect may have contributed to the improved biomass productivity. The overall biomass yield from methanol was 0.32 g/g.    The  sMMO activity, 8.6 [µmol naphthol][g of biomass] -1 [h] -1 was  much lower in Fermentation  2  because  the  inoculum  had  lost  the  ability  to  produce  high  levels  of sMMO. Chapter 5 focuses on efforts to recover sMMO activity.\n\nThe YCO2/CH3OH was calculated by online measurement of CCP and CMC. It was adjusted automatically (every 15 min) over the course of the fed-batch cultivation. The apparent yield (2 ± 0.25 g/g or 1.45 ± 0.18 mol/mol) was higher at the earlier stages of\n\nthe  fed-batch  cultivation  experiments  (Figure  4-5  and  4-7).  This  range  exceeds  the maximum  possible  yield  which  is  1  mol/mol  assuming  all  methanol  is  converted  to carbon dioxide.  This indicates an error in the estimation of the initial apparent yield. In the early growth phase, the supplementation of 3.5 ± 0.5 % CO2 probably resulted in an overestimation  of  the  initial  CCP  used  in  calculating  the  apparent  yield.  As  growth continued  and  CO2  production  rate  increased,  this  error  became  negligible.  Hence  the ability to fine tune the apparent YCO2/CH3OH online proved crucial particularly during the early growth phase. The CCP feeding strategy with online yield estimation precluded the overfeeding  of  methanol  to  the  bioreactor.  Therefore  the  fail-safe  methanol  feedback control was not executed.\n\nBiomass (g/L)\n\n60\n\n50\n\n40\n\n30\n\n20-\n\n10 -\n\n.\n\n700\n\n600 -\n\n500 -\n\nз 400 -\n\n300 -\n\n200 -\n\n100 -\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\nFioure 4.7.

Ammonium concentration in the  bioreactor  increased  (Figure  4-8)  which subsequently had an adverse effect on cell growth rates (Figure 4-9).\n\nThe  fed-batch cultivation terminated  due  to  excessive  foaming  caused  by phosphate  limitation.  At  approximately  120  h,  the  phosphate  concentration  dropped below  optimal  concentration  for  growth,  0.19  g/L  (2mM)  and  continued  to  decline thereafter  (Figure  4-8).

{"chunk": "[Section: 4.3 Conclusions]\nThe ability to perform online measurements on both carbon dioxide production and the mass  of  total  substrate  fed,  provided  a  means  of  executing  the  CCP  feeding  strategy. Since methanol is an inhibitory substrate, the ability to measure methanol concentration online was beneficial in fine-tuning values of YCO2/CH3OH utilized in the feeding strategy which maintained an almost constant methanol concentration. The overall yield of CO2 from methanol was 0.94 g/g. The studies carried out on inhibitory effects of methanol and ammonium showed that concentrations below 2 g/L and 0.09 g/L (5 mM) respectively were most favorable for rapid growth. The cell yield from methanol and nitrogen were estimated to be 0.3 g dry cell wt/g CH3OH and 12 g dry cell wt/g N respectively. It was shown that it is possible to cultivate M. trichosporium OB3b on methanol while retaining high sMMO activity (300 -500 [µmol naphthol][g of biomass] -1 [h] -1 ). The estimation of yield parameters provided a basis of modifying the Higgin's NMS medium (Cornish et al., 1984).  This facilitated the automatic feeding of nutrient salts based on their yields to methanol in fed-batch reactor runs. Sigma 204 and canola vegetable oil were inhibitory antifoam agents. Sigma SE-15 was not inhibitory to growth and was effective in reducing foaming.

The second set of experiments (in duplicate), was identical to the first except the cells were cultivated on methane which was replenished daily with a methane/air mixture (4:1) at a flow rate of 3 L/min for 5 min. The inocula for each group of experiments were prepared with medium B and 2 g/L methanol.\n\nAllylthiourea acts as a copper chelator (Hubley et al., 1975), limiting cell access to copper and thus promoting the switch from pMMO to sMMO production. Therefore, the addition of allylthiourea to the growth medium should sequester the available copper and increase sMMO production.  In the methanol cultures, sMMO activity is about two orders of magnitude lower than the nominal range of 300 to 600 [µmol naphthol][g of biomass ]-1 [h] -1 .  There  was  no  significant  impact  of  15  µM  allylthiourea  on  enzyme activity in methanol grown cells (Table 5-2). However with the methane grown cells, the enzyme activity was higher for both set of cultures. It is probable that for the cultures\n\ngrowing on methanol, there was little driving force to stimulate the production of sMMO because it is not required by the cells for methanol metabolism. However in the methanecultivated cells, the enzyme is necessary for methane metabolism, thus the cells had to produce  sMMO  for  survival.  The  methane  grown  cultures  without  allylthiourea  had higher biomass density and sMMO activity than cells grown in medium containing 15 µM  allylthiourea.  The  copper  content  in  medium  B  was  less  than  0.01  ppm,  since allylthiourea is a metal chelator, with an affinity for ions with a 2+ charge, it is likely that with  such  a  low  Cu 2+ concentration  in  the  growth  medium,  allylthiourea  may  have sequestered another cation such as Fe 2+ which is required for sMMO production. Fe 2+ has been  shown  by  Shah  et  al.,  (1992)  to  be  required  for  high  levels  of  sMMO  synthesis.

The long response time (12 min) of the probe can be improved upon by increasing the gas permeability of the membrane. The probe provided a means of fine-tuning the yield of CO2 from methanol online, which was used  in  the  CCP  strategy  for  methanol  feeding.  The  CCP  strategy  was  effective  at providing an adaptive control of methanol concentration. Ammonium was inhibitory at concentrations  exceeding  5  mM  (0.09  g/L).  Antifoaming  agent,  Sigma  SE-15  had  no effect on cell growth while vegetable oil and Sigma antifoam 204 were inhibitory.
