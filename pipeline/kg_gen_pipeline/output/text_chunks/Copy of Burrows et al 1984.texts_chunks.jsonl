{"chunk": "[Section: INTRODUCTION]\nThe oxidation  of  methane  to methanol by  methanotrophs  is catalysed  by  methane monooxygenase (M  MO).  Scott et  al. (1 98 1 a, b) discovered  that Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b possesses soluble or particulate (rnernbrane-bound)  cell-free  MMO activity  depending on the conditions under  which  it  is  grown.  Particulate  MMO  was  present  in  organisms grown  in continuous culture  under oxygen-limited, nitrate-excess  conditions,  whilst  soluble MMO was present  in nitrate-depleted  cultures.  It was suggested  therefore,  that the availability of nitrate might determine the intracellular location of MMO (Scott et al., 1981 a,  b). Stanley et at. (1983) have  now  shown  that  in Methylococcus  capsulatus (Bath) and M. trichosporium OB3b  the intracellular location of MMO is determined by the availability  of copper; particulate cell-free MMO activity  was observed  when  the organisms were  grown  at high  Cuz+  :biomass ratios, whereas  organisms  subjected  to  copper  deficiency  contained  soluble  MMO.  The  growth conditions used by Scott et al. (1981 a) masked the underlying copper effect. The particulate and soluble MMOs were found to differ in inhibitor specificity, the former being more sensitive to metal-chelating agents, although NAD(P)H was found to be the only suitable electron donor for both  activities (Scott et al., 1981a).\n\nThe ability of MMOs from a number of methanotrophs to oxidize a wide range of substrates is well documented (Colby et al., 1977; Stirling et al., 1979; Higgins et al., 1979; Pate1 et al., 1980). These  substrates  include n-alkanes, n-alkenes and  ethers,  and  aromatic, alicyclic and heterocyclic compounds. Methylomonas methanica, however, appears to have a more restricted substrate range. The particulate cell-free MMO from this organism does not oxidize aromatic, alicyclic  and  heterocyclic  compounds (Stirling et  al., 1979).\n\nThis  work  compares  directly  the  substrate  specificities  of M.  trichosporium OB3b  cells containing either soluble or particulate  MMO.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/29", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 61.999, "t": 389.837, "r": 445.772, "b": 224.79899999999998, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/30", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 62.5, "t": 222.837, "r": 446.08, "b": 158.19900000000007, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/31", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 62.4, "t": 155.92499999999995, "r": 445.797, "b": 135.79899999999998, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "INTRODUCTION", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "The oxidation  of  methane  to methanol by  methanotrophs  is catalysed  by  methane monooxygenase (M  MO).", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 109, "document_start": 1343, "document_end": 1452, "length": 107}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "Scott et  al.

{"chunk": "[Section: METHODS — Part 1]\nOrganism and grottith conditions. Methjdosinus trichosporium OB3b was obtained from Professor R. Whittenbury, Department of Biological Sciences, University of Warwick, UK. The organism was grown on the nitrate mineral salts medium ( N S M ) of Cornish et al. (1984). This contains 1 p-Cu2+ and is here referred to as the 'low copper medium'. The 'high copper medium' referred to in the text contains 5 ~M-CU'+. M. trichosporium OB3b was grown\n\non the low copper medium in continuous culture (oxygen-limited) in a 10 I capacity LKB 1601 Ultroferm fermenter with methane as sole carbon source (temperature, 30 \"C;  impeller speed, 500 r.p.m.; pH 6.8;  methane flow rate, 250 ml min-' ; air flow rate, 1000 ml min-' ; dilution rate, 0.04 h-' ; biomass density, 16-1.8  mg dry wt ml-I ). The organism was grown on the high copper medium in continuous culture (oxygen-limited) in a 2 1 capacity fermenter (L. H. Engineering Co., type L.H.E.  CCl500) with methane as sole carbon source (temperature, 30 \"C; impeller speed, 400 r.p.m.;  pH 6.8; methane flow rate, 50 ml min-' ; air flow rate, 250 ml min-I ; dilution  rate, 0.04 h-' ; biomass density,  1.61.8 mg dry wt ml-I).\n\nPreparation of suspensions o f M. trichosporium OB3b. Organisms were  harvested  by  centrifugation  (4420 g, 20 min,  4 \"C),  washed once  with 20 mM-sodium  phosphate  buffer  containing 5 mM-MgC1, (pH 7.0)  and resuspended in the same buffer to give the required bacterial density (see below). Suspensions prepared in this way were used  throughout  this work.\n\nAssay o f cell-free M M O  activity. Cell-free extracts were prepared from suspensions of M. trichosporium OB3b (30-35  mg dry wt ml-I) using sonication to disrupt the cells (4 x 15 s bursts, 16 pm amplitude, with 1 min cooling on ice between  bursts).  Particulate and soluble fractions were prepared  and stored as described  by  Scott et al. (1981 a). MMO activity was measured by following the epoxidation of propene, a substrate of soluble and particulate MMO (Colby et al., 1977; Stirling et al., 1979; Scott er al., 1981 a). Assays were carried out in  10 ml conical flasks (capped with Suba-seals) which contained 1 ml soluble or particulate fractions (5-10  mg protein). Propene gas (2 ml) was introduced by injection and the reaction was started by adding NADH ( 5 mM) as electron donor. Flasks were incubated at 30 \"C for 5 min in a reciprocating water bath shaker operating at 160 oscillations min-I. Propene oxide was measured by gas chromatography using a Porapak Q column (2.1 m x 4 mm i.d.) attached to a Pye  Unicam  series  204  or  304  instrument  fitted  with  flame  ionization  detectors  [oven  temperature,  140°C; injector, 200 \"C; detector,  200 \"C; carrier gas (Nz) flow  rate,  40 ml min-1 3.\n\nAssay o f u+to/e-cell  oxidations. Incubations were carried out in  10 ml conical flasks (capped  with Suba-seals) containing 1 ml cell suspension (10-1 2 mg dry wt). Assays were started by  injecting the substrate (2 ml gaseous substrate, 2 pl liquid substrate). Sodium formate (20 mM) was used as a source of reducing equivalents in all assays. Flasks were shaken at 30 \"C in a reciprocating water bath operating at 160 oscillations  min-' , Samples were withdrawn for product determination 4 min after starting the incubation and thereafter at 10-12  min intervals over a period of 60 min. Products were measured by gas chromatography using a Pye-Unicam series 204 or 304 instrument  fitted  with  flame  ionization  detectors  [detector,  200°C;  injector,  200°C;  carrier  gas  (NJ flow  rate, 40 ml min-'  1.  Products of n-alkane oxidation  (primary  and  secondary alcohols,  and  aldehydes) were  analysed using a Porapak Q column (2.1 m x 4 mm id.). The column temperatures used for analysis of the oxidation products of different n-alkanes were as follows: ethane, 140 \"C;  propane, 180 \"C; butane, 200 \"C; pentane, 220 \"C and hexane, 220 \"C. Products resulting from the oxidation of aromatic or alicyclic compounds were extracted into ethyl acetate (1 : 1, v/v) and were then analysed using an SP2100 column (2.1 m x 4 mm id.).  The column temperatures used  to  analyse  oxidation  products  of  aromatic  and  alicyclic  substrates  were  as  follows:  benzene,  110 \"C ethylbenzene,  100 \"C; styrene,  120 \"C and cyclohexane, 100 \"C.\n\nEthanol disappearance was measured using gas chromatography. Reactions were carried out in  10 ml conical flasks containing: cell suspension (2.5-10 mg dry wt ml-'),  1 ml; and ethanol (15 mM).  The flasks were capped with  Suba-seals  and shaken (130 oscillations min-I)  at 30 \"C. Ethanol  was determined as described  above.\n\nDry weight determination.

{"chunk": "[Section: Substrate speciJicities  of soluble and particulate  MMO]\nOxidation of n-alkanes. Table 1 lists the products resulting from the oxidation of n-alkanes by suspensions of M. trichosporium OB3b which contained either soluble or particulate MMO, and gives the  initial  rates  of  their  formation.  The  figures given for primary  alcohols cannot  be regarded as  true rates, since  these are  oxidized further to the corresponding aldehydes by the nonspecific methanol (primary alcohol) dehydrogenase (Patel et al., 1972).  The aldehydes may also be oxidized further by a general aldehyde dehydrogenase to give the corresponding carboxylic acids (Patel et al., 1980). Suspensions containing either soluble or particulate MMO oxidized ethane to acetaldehyde without accumulating ethanol. Formation of ethanol was observed, however,  when  suspensions  were  prepared  in  200 mM-sodium  phosphate  buffer,  showing  that ethanol is the initial oxidation product. The accumulation of ethanol under these circumstances is due to inhibition of the methanol oxidation by high concentrations of phosphate (Higgins & Quayle,  1970), though there  is no evidence that  this  is due to direct inhibition of  methanol dehydrogenase. On raising the phosphate concentration from 20 m M   to 200 m M   there was a 91 7; decrease in  the  rate  of  ethanol  oxidation  by  organisms  containing particulate MMO, whilst MMO activity, measured by  following the epoxidation  of  propene  in the presence of  20 m M sodium formate, decreased by only 25-30 %. Suspensions of M. trichosporium OB3  b containing soluble MMO catalysed both terminal and subterminal hydroxylation of propane and butane, as evidenced by the formation of the corresponding primary and secondary alcohols.

Propanal and butanal accumulated, however, showing  that  terminal  hydroxylation  was  occurring  but  that  both  the  respective  primary alcohols  were oxidized further. Both MMOs  oxidized pentane to pentanal (via pentan-1-01)  and pentan-2-01, but  oxidation  at  position 3 of  the  carbon  chain  was  not  observed.  Oxidation products were not detected when suspensions or cell-free  extracts were incubated with n-hexane. This was true whether they contained soluble or particulate  MMO.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/95", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 61.9, "t": 249.61699999999996,

{"chunk": "[Section: DISCUSSION]\nThis work corroborates the finding of Stanley et al. (1983) that copper availability determines the intracellular location (soluble  or particulate) of MMO in M. trichosporium OB3b. This is also the case for Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (Stanley et al., 1983). Research to date (Scott et al., 1981 a; Stanley et al., 1983)  has indicated that there are differences between soluble and particulate MMOs besides their intracellular location, which suggest that the particulate enzymes are not derived from the soluble  enzymes merely by membrane attachment. Our results support and extend previous findings.\n\nIn both M. trichosporium OB3b and M. capsulatus (Bath) the inhibitor profile of  the soluble MMOs differs considerably from that of the particulate enzyme (Scott et al., 1981 a; Stanley et\n\na/., 1983),  and although both types of MMO can use NADH as an electron donor i n ritro, Tonge eta/. (1975)  have suggested that i n civo the particulate enzymes  may receive reducing equivalents from  the  electron  transport  chain  or  from  NADH-independent dehydrogenases  such  as methanol dehydrogenase. This is supported by the recent observations of Leak & Dalton, (1983). Our findings show that the particulate MMO of M. trichosporium OB3b differs from the soluble enzyme in that it is unable to oxidize aromatic or alicyclic compounds (both enzymes oxidize methane, propene and n-alkanes). This suggests that the hydroxylase components of  the two enzymes are different, and provides a further important distinction  between the two types of MMO. It is of interest to note that the substrate specificity  of the particulate M M O   of Methj-lomonas methanica (Stirling et al., 1979) is the same as that reported  here for the corresponding enzyme from M. trichosporium OB3b. The ability to oxidize n-alkanes and n-alkenes but not aromatics or alicyclics may prove to be a general property of particulate MMOs, in which case it might be possible to determine whether or not organisms possess the soluble enzyme (which oxidize all four classes of  compound) simply by  measuring their capacity  to oxidize a cyclic hydrocarbon such as ethylbenzene. This is clearly possible for M. trichosporium OB3b.\n\nIt has been suggested that methanotrophs might be used as biocatalysts in order to carry out epoxidations  and hydroxylations on an industrial  scale (Higgins et a/., 1981 ; Whittenbury & Dalton,  1982; Hou,  1984). Our findings shown that if M. trichosporium OB3b is to be used to oxidize cyclic hydrocarbons in an industrial process, then it will be essential to ensure that it is grown under conditions which yield  soluble MMO. This restriction  may well  apply to other met  hanotrop  hs.\n\nThe soluble MMO of M. capsulatus (Bath) is now known to be a three-component  enzyme (Colby & Dalton, 1976 ; Woodland & Dalton, 1984),  and the corresponding enzyme  from M. trichosporium OB3b seems to be essentially similar (Stirling & Dalton,  1979). By  contrast, nothing is known of  the polypeptide composition of  the respective particulate enzymes. Stanley et al. (1 983) have shown that three major polypeptides are present in cell-free  extracts prepared from suspensions of M.  capsulatus (Bath) which contain soluble MMO. These correspond to the three subunits (mol. wt 54000,42000, 17000)  of component A of the soluble MMO of this organism, and may constitute up to 30% of the total soluble protein (Woodland & Dalton, 1984).  All three polypeptides disappear during the copper-induced transition from soluble to particulate MMO, whilst additional membrane-bound polypeptides accumulate (Stanley et al., 1983).  The levels of some of the major cellular polypeptides of M. trichosporium OB3b appear to change in a similar fashion, although it is not known at present whether any of these correspond to components of the soluble or particulate  MMOs. This will only be established when  both enzymes from M. trichosporium OB3b have been purified, and this is currently under investigation. This is likely to prove  difficult for  the  membrane-bound  enzyme,  however,  since  attempts  to  solubilize the particulate  MMOs of  both M. methanica (Colby et al., 1975)  and M. trichosporium OB3b (the present  work) have resulted  in loss of  activity.\n\nWe wish to thank the Science and Engineering Research Council for funding (K.
