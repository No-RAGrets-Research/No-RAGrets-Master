{"chunk": "[Section: a b s t r a c t]\nSoluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) can degrade many chlorinated and aromatic pollutants. It is produced by certain methanotrophs such as Methylosinus trichosporium when grown on methane under copper limitation but, due to its low aqueous solubility, methane cannot support dense biomass growth. Since it is water soluble, methanol may be a more attractive growth substrate, but it is widely believed that sMMO is not produced on methanol. In this study, when the growth-limiting substrate was switched from methane to methanol, in the presence of the particulate MMO inhibitor, allylthiourea, growth of M. trichosporium OB3b continued unabated and sMMO activity was completely retained. When allylthiourea was then removed, sMMO activity was maintained for an additional 24 generations, albeit at a slightly lower level due to the presence of 0.70 𝛍 Mof Cu 2+ in the feed medium. While a biomass density of only 2 g l -1 could be obtained on methane, 7.4 g l -1 was achieved by feeding methanol exponentially, and 29gl -1 was obtained using a modified feeding strategy employing on-line carbon dioxide production measurement. It was concluded that methanol can be employed to produce large amounts of M. trichosporium biomass containing sMMO.\n\n©2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.\n\nas the sole source of carbon and energy was about 5 g l -1 (Asenjo and Suk, 1986) in a baffled shake-flask and about 18 g l -1 (with low sMMO activity) in a bioreactor (Shah et al., 1996). Higher biomass concentrations must be obtained to be economically attractive.\n\nThe aforementioned limitations in bioreactor productivity were at least partly due to the low aqueous solubility of methane. As a carbon source, methane is first oxidized to methanol by MMO. Many methanotrophs are able to grow on methanol, with no need for methane. Methanol is inexpensive and presents fewer safety concerns than methane. More importantly, methanol is completely miscible in water so there is no mass transfer limitation of growth.Methylotrophshavebeenproducedinhigh-densityculture (Bourque et al., 1995), but none of these produce sMMO. Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (ATCC 35070) is the type II methanotroph most frequently studied for sMMO production. It has been grown to a biomass concentration of 3.2gl -1 in chemostat culture on 1.0% (v/v) methanol (Best and Higgins, 1981). An sMMO constitutive mutant of M. trichosporium OB3b (PP358) produced 1.0gl -1 biomass on methanol (Fitch et al., 1996). Both aforementioned cultures retained sMMO activity on methanol. However, many publications have reported, and it is still generally believed, that no sMMO production occurs in type II methanotrophs grown on methanol (Hou et al., 1979; Patel et al., 1980; Sullivan et al., 1998).

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.1. sMMO activity]\nThe capacity of M. trichosporium OB3b to retain sMMO activity while growing on methanol was investigated. The culture was initially grown in batch mode on NMS medium with methane as the sole source of carbon and energy. Although the medium was formulated to minimize copper content, about 0.70 𝛍 M Cu 2+ was still present in the feed. Therefore, allylthiourea (15 𝛍 M) was added to inhibit synthesis of pMMO. Continuous medium flow began at 71 h with a dilution rate of 0.05 h -1 . Headspace methane was maintained at 22% (v/v). As steady state was approached (judged by methane uptake rate, CO2 production, biomass concentration, and sMMO activity), sMMO activity of about 550 𝛍 mol naphthol produced gbiomass -1 h -1 was obtained (Fig. 1), which is comparable to the sMMO activity usually reported for this strain when grown on methane in the absence of copper (Bowman and Sayler, 1994; Koh et al., 1993). After stopping the methane supply and switching to feed containing methanol, the majority of the sMMOactivity remained intact. During the brief period when both methane and methanol were present, higher sMMO activity was observed.\n\nAfter 6 generations of growth on methanol with allylthiourea, the feed was changed to one without allylthiourea. The specific sMMO activity dropped only slightly to 490 𝛍 mol naphthol produced gbiomass -1 h -1 (Fig. 2). This level of sMMO activity was maintained for 24 generations. Subsequent addition of 4.5 𝛍 Mcopper to the growth medium caused sMMO activity to diminish to\n\n•\n\n• [CH,OH] estimated (g l')\n\nSpecific sMMO activity\n\n(umol naphthol produced g biomass''

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.2. Fed-batch fermentation using exponential feeding of methanol]\nOnce stability of sMMO in methanol-grown cells was established, a methodology for producing high-density M. trichosporium OB3b biomass was investigated. Growth in shake-flasks occurred at up to 40 g l -1 of initial methanol concentration but only after a long lag period, so batch cultivation was initiated with 5 g l -1 of methanol (Fig. 3). At 72 h, methanol feeding began at a rate designed to produce a /SYN of 0.06h -1 . However the /SYN CPR (specific growth rate calculated based on CO2 production) was only 0.037h -1 , this resulted in methanol accumulation in the fermentation broth. At 86.2, 109.4, 135.8, and 157.5 h, methanol feeding was stopped for 6.5, 3.8, 12.2 and 14.0 h, respectively (as seen in the plateaus in the 'methanol fed' data in Fig. 3) to allow the concentration to decrease. Over 160 h of fed-batch fermentation, 7.4 g l -1 biomass was produced.\n\nThe inhibitory effect of methanol was examined at time periods where changes in growth rate and methanol concentration occurred. For example, at 157.5 h, after methanol feeding was stopped, the residual methanol dropped from 3.28 to 0.47gl -1 , /SYN CPR increased to as high as 0.3 h -1 (Fig. 3). The results demonstrated that a methanol concentration above 3 g l -1 hasasignificant inhibitory effect on metabolic activity. The increase in /SYN CPR caused the methanol concentration to drop rapidly to growth-limiting values (less than 0.47 g l -1 ). This caused the /SYN CPR to decrease to a point\n\nBatch\n\n(a)\n\nFed-Batch\n\n0.4\n\n16\n\n14\n\n0.3\n\nwhere cell growth could not be recovered. These results are typical of several fermentations conducted in a similar manner.\n\nThis ineffective feeding strategy was then modified. Instead of using a pre-set /SYN , CCP was used to control methanol feeding. Y CO2 / S was determined from previous experiments to be 0.73gg -1 and two fermentations with two different methanol concentration setpoints were performed to assess the new feeding strategy (Fig. 4). Methanol concentration was better controlled at low biomass concentrations, but high methanol demand (based on CCP) at higher biomass concentrations resulted in over-feeding in both fermentations. A dry weight biomass density of 19 g l -1 wasobtainedin169h when the methanol concentration was controlled at about 3gl -1 (Fig. 4a). An even higher biomass density of 29 g l -1 was achieved in only 119 h by further lowering the methanol concentration setpoint to about 2 g l -1 (Fig. 4b).

{"chunk": "[Section: 4. Discussion]\nSincetypeIImethanotrophssuchas M.trichosporium OB3bgrow so slowly, attempts have been made to produce sMMO in recombinantorganisms.Althoughprogressisbeingmadeinthisarea(Smith et al., 2002), expression of fully active sMMO in the recombinants is hampered by the complex nature of the enzyme, especially the hydroxylase component. Therefore, we chose to examine sMMO production in a wild type strain growing on a more suitable growth substrate than methane. While a couple of studies have found that type II methanotrophs express sMMO when grown on methanol (Best and Higgins, 1981), most have concluded that they do not (Hou et al., 1979; Patel et al., 1980). In our chemostat experiments, there was no apparent difference in sMMO production whether M. trichosporium OB3b was grown on methane or on methanol.\n\n[CH, OH] (g l*)\n\nBiomass\n\n35\n\n30\n\n25\n\n20-\n\n15\n\n2\n\n10 °\n\n5\n\n1\n\n30-\n\n25-\n\n20\n\n15\n\n10 -\n\n5\n\n0\n\n55\n\n- 50\n\n150 151 152 153 154 155 156 157 158 159 160 161 162.\n\n- 45\n\nTime (h)\n\n•\n\n- 2.0\n\n1.0\n\n(b)\n\n20\n\n40\n\n60\n\n120\n\n140\n\n160\n\n- 5.0\n\n- 4.0\n\n- 3.0\n\n- 2.0\n\n- 1.0\n\n+ 0.0\n\n180\n\n80\n\n100\n\nTime (h)\n\nHowever, the microorganism did sometimes lose sMMO activity when stock cultures were maintained on mineral salts agar with methanol. Activity could be recovered by growing it on methane withcopperlimitation.ThereasonwhyMMOactivityismaintained while growing on methanol in some experiments but not others, remains to be determined. Never the less, the data from the present study proves conclusively that sMMO activity can be maintained in cultures growing on methanol.\n\nThis strain of M. trichosporium can tolerate exposure to as much as 40gl -1 methanol, but 3gl -1 was found to significantly inhibit growth. Therefore chemostat or well-controlled fed-batch culture are the most likely methods for the production of sMMO competent M. trichosporium from methanol. Control of fed-batch fermentations depends on supplying all of the nutrients at appropriate rates or concentrations. In terms of fermentation control, the key nutrient in this case is methanol. If the methanol level falls too low, growth slows due to limitation in carbon or energy, while, if there is too much methanol, growth will slow because of inhibition. As showninFig.5,beforemethanolfeedingwasstopped,themethanol concentration was above 3gl -1 and the CO2 production remained almost constant. Once methanol feeding was stopped at 157.5h, the CO2 production began to increase as methanol concentration dropped. When entirely deprived of methanol, the cells may enter a physiological state where recovery of rapid growth is severely retarded even after addition of sufficient methanol. This occurred at the end of the fermentation depicted in Fig. 3. We obtained a M. trichosporium OB3b biomass concentration of 29gl -1 using a CCPbased strategy to control the methanol concentration. Much higher cell densities should be obtainable if the methanol concentration can be more rigorously controlled.\n\nThe specific growth rate on methanol, whether in chemostat or fed-batch, was generally less than 0.1 h -1 even when higher\n\n(a)\n\n6.0\n\n65\n\n- 5.0\n\n• 3.0\n\nfeeding rates were imposed. This is similar to growth on methane. Thus, although a much higher biomass density may be obtained from growth on methanol, productivity is still limited by a low growth rate. However, the transient /SYN CPR reached as high as 0.3 h -1 at about 0.7 g l -1 methanol. Although the specific growth rate calculated from carbon dioxide production data may be misleading under transient conditions due to unbalanced growth, these data suggest the intriguing possibility of higher growth rates, but other factors require investigation. For example, PO4 and other ions have been shown to inhibit methanol dehydrogenase activity (Mehta et al., 1989) and previous work (Yu et al., 2006) indicated the presence of a metabolic bottleneck in this organism. However, if these barriers can be overcome, and if sufficient control of the concentration of methanol and other significant medium components during fedbatch fermentation can be maintained, it may be possible to obtain asubstantialincreaseinspecificgrowthrate.Evenifthegrowthrate is not increased, substantially higher biomassconcentrationscanbe obtained on methanol by fed-batch fermentation. This knowledge, combined with the conclusive evidence that sMMO expression can be maintained during growth on methanol should aid in the development of sMMO-based industrial and environmental processes. In future work, we intend to develop an improved process for the control of methanol during fed-batch fermentations and to monitor sMMO production throughout these fermentations. This should result in much higher biomass densities and provide greater insight regarding the effects of methylotrophic fed-batch conditions on sMMO synthesis.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref":
