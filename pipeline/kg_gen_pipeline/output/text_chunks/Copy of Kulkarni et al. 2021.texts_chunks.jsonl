In various natural and anthropogenic processes 900 Tg methane emission signi /uniFB01 -cantly affects climate change (1). Valorisation of these gases into value added products can be an ideal scenario for decarbonization and bio-economy. Biogas is one of the potentially accessible GHG with methane (50 e 70%) and carbon dioxide (25 e 50%) as its major constituents (2). Industrially biogas is produced from major feedstocks like distillery spent wash, food waste, municipal solid waste, sugars, and bio-oil industries. In addition to these bio-based waste residues, second generation feedstocks from agricultural residues like sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, corn cobs, sorghum straw, cotton stalk and others also have the potential to produce signi /uniFB01 cant quantities of biogas. Anaerobic digestion of such agriculture residues and industrial waste into biogas provides a sustainable source of energy.\n\nConversion of gaseous feedstock of methane and carbon dioxide into different products will be an attractive approach to add value to overall bio-economy (3). Apart from being major component of biogas, methane is also available from natural gas reserves (113 trillion m 3 ) (4). Methane is also harmful to environment with ~20 folds higher global warming effect than carbon dioxide (1). Due to\n\navailability in large quantity and its effect on environment methane was identi /uniFB01 ed as potential substrate in this study. Methanotrophic organisms which are known to utilize methane as sole source of carbon can be used to develop technology for biological valorization of methane (1,4,5). Methanotrophs have been demonstrated previously for their ability to produce wide variety of products including methanol, ectoin, polyhydroxy butyrate, 2,3-butanediol, single cell protein, carotenoids, vitamin B12, lactic acid and electricity generation (3,6 e 8). Biobased methanol is a potential biofuel because of its properties like high octane number, lesser pollutant emission and compatibility in present automobile engines (9). Methane is also known as a fuel but the advantages of methanol like high energy density (400-fold) and its ease of transportation justi /uniFB01 es methanol production from methane (10). Along with CH4, methanol production has also been reported using CO2 as well as mixture of GHGs (5,11,12). Furthermore, the use of methanol derivatives as fuel additives and feedstock for fuel production is an established concept. Due to potential of methanol as a biofuel and its conversion to several intermediate chemicals, methanol is an ideal product from methane (9,13).", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/2", "label":

Selection of suitable methanotrophic platform can play a key critical role in minimizing process requirements and operational costs. Key characteristics of methanotroph like optimum temperature for growth, methanol tolerance, methane conversion rate, titer, yield and productivity can have an impact on the overall cost of the bioprocess.\n\nIn the present study, an industrially suitable organism was systematically selected from wide diversity of genus and species of methanotrophs.

Phylogenetic tree of pmoA amino acid sequences was constructed by neighbor joining method with 100 bootstrap replicates using CLC main workbench 8.1 software.\n\nMicrobial cultures, media compositions and cultivation Methylotuvimicrobium alcaliphilum DSMZ 19304, Methylocella silvestris DSMZ 15510, Methylomonas methanica DSMZ 25384 and Methylosinus trichosporium NCIMB 11131 were received from DSMZ and NCIMB culture banks. Neutrophilic organism M. trichosporium , M. silvestris and M. methanica were cultivated in nitrate mineral salt medium described previously (16,18). To grow M. trichosporium and M. methanica , 1 m M of CuSO4 was added in nitrate mineral salt media before inoculation whereas haloalkaliphilic methanotroph M. alcaliphilum was cultivated in methylmicrobium medium (DSMZ medium 1180). Carbon source in the form of methane and/or methanol were provided as\n\nper experimental design. All methanotrophs were incubated at 30 /C14 C on 150 rpm shaking condition except for M. silvestris , which was grown at 25 /C14 C and 150 rpm. Media was dispensed to maintain 1:5 medium to headspace ratio in screw cap bottles with silicon septum. After inoculation of organisms in sealed bottles, headspace air was displaced by /uniFB01 rst applying vacuum till /C0 10 psi gauge reading through 0.2 m m /uniFB01 lter and sparging methane-oxygen gas mixture (1:1 ratio) till reading changed to 10 psi. This cycle was repeated for three times before culture incubation. The same gassing protocol was used for all growth and biotransformation trials at bottle level.\n\nMethanol tolerance studies To estimate methanol tolerance, exponentially grown culture was inoculated into 50 mL respective media containing 0 e 7% v/v methanol, and cell growth was analyzed. Methanol tolerance in the presence of methane was done in 250 mL screw cap bottles using 1:1 methane to oxygen gas mixture. Methanol tolerance in the absence of methane was performed in 250 mL Erlenmeyer /uniFB02 ask.\n\nFermentor cultivation Methanotroph was inoculated into seed bottle containing 50 mL of respective media in 250 mL bottle with methane-oxygen mixture (1:1) and incubated till exponential phase (48 e 72 h). Grown culture was used for inoculation of 1.25 L screw cap /uniFB02 asks containing 250 mL media using 10% v/v inoculum. This culture was termed as pre-fermentor culture and was incubated for 48 e 72 h till exponential phase.

All ports of fermentor were then closed, and fermentor was held at 10 psi gauge pressure for 10 min. After achieving gas saturation, pressure was released and fermentor was inoculated with 10% v/v pre-fermentor culture. Fresh methane-\n\noxygen mixture was sparged till 10 psi gauge reading to initiate methane fermentation. After every 6 h of incubation, headspace gas containing unconverted CH4:O2 mixture and CO2 was released and fresh methane-oxygen mixture (1:1) was fed through sparger till 10 psi gauge pressure. Between every 6 h of the gassing cycle, dissolved oxygen (DO) reduced gradually and did not fall below 30%.

{"chunk": "[Section: RESULTS — Part 1]\nSystematic selection of methanotrophs In order to select industrially important methanotroph, data on 60 diverse methanotrophs including their genetic and physiological information was updated from previous published reports (27,28). These reports provided data on phylogenetic and physiological characteristics of diverse and pure isolates of methanotrophs from wide variety of habitats. Methanotrophic strains were grouped in different categories (Fig. 1) and assessed for their ability to produce methanol based on industrially relevant characteristics. Methanotrophs were segregated into major groups as gamma-proteobacteria (group A, 45 strains) and alphaproteobacteria (group B, 15 strains). Mesophilic strains from each group were further selected to design fermentation process under ambient conditions for industrial product like methanol. Selection of mesophilic methanotrophs resulted in reduction of relevant strains to 33 and 13 from group A and B, respectively (Fig. 1). As MMO enzyme activity is the most important factor affecting methane to methanol conversion, it was selected to understand variation in types of MMO within different groups. Methanotrophs were further segregated into subgroups based on the presence and absence of particulate form of methane monooxygenase enzyme. All members of group A possess pMMO, whereas 11 strains of group B were found to have pMMO (group B1) and the rest two strains possess only soluble form of MMO (group B2). Out of three subunits of pMMO, pmoA is considered as a conserved subunit and has been used for studying diversity of methanotrophs by construction of phylogenetic tree (31). Amino acid sequence of pmoA was analyzed using neighbor joining analysis (Fig. 2) to /uniFB01 nd taxonomic difference within groups. Analysis of pmoA sequence separated group A into A1 (6 species) and A2 (22 species), while analyzing group B, Methylocystis bryophila was found to be diverse from rest of group B1. Based on reports of slower growth rate, methanol sensitivity around 0.15% v/v (32) and lower methanol production (16), M. bryophilla was not considered for further evaluation. Representative methanotroph from each sub-group was selected on the basis of availability in culture collection centers, availability of genome sequence and genetic engineering toolkit, genome scale metabolic model and overall research data in published literature. Selected representative methanotrophs for group A1, A2, B1 and B2 are M. methanica , M. alcaliphilum , M. trichosporium OB3b and M. silvestris, respectively (Fig. 1). Selected strains were further evaluated for methanol tolerance and methanol production ability.\n\nMethanol tolerance Methanol tolerance of selected strains in the presence and absence of methane was analyzed and different degree of tolerance was observed in each methanotrophic strain (Fig. 3). In both presence and absence of methane, selected strains showed methanol tolerance at or above 4% v/v. Amongst selected strains M. alcaliphilum was found to have the highest methanol tolerance of 5% v/v in the presence of methane and 6% v/v in the absence of methane.\n\nMethanol production using suspended cell biotransformation MDH enzyme converts methanol to formaldehyde and its inhibition is important to increase methanol accumulation. MDH was inhibited using inhibitors like potassium phosphate, MgCl2, EDTA, NaCl and NH4Cl (3,16). Considering reducing energy requirement of MMO enzyme, addition of external reducing agent like sodium formate is essential for\n\nA\n\n0.022\n\n2.013\n\n0.191\n\nhigher methane to methanol conversion (1,23). In the present study, MDH inhibitors were screened for selected methanotrophs and reducing agent requirement was identi /uniFB01 ed to enhance methanol production. All control experiments were performed in the absence of MDH inhibitors. 0.023\n\nBiotransformation reaction with different concentration of MDH inhibitors was performed using 40 mmol L /C0 1 sodium formate as a reducing agent (Fig. 4A e E). Ammonium chloride at 20 mmol L /C0 1 concentration was found to be optimum inhibitor for M. alcaliphilum and produced 224.06 mg/L methanol, whereas potassium phosphate at 200 mmol L /C0 1 and 100 mmol L /C0 1 was found to be optimum for M. methanica and M. silvestris producing 188.03 mg/L and 161.23 mg/L methanol, respectively. Interestingly, in the presence of potassium phosphate, M. alcaliphilum also produced high methanol (218.90 mg/L) compared to M. methanica and M. silvestris . Methanol production was found to be decreasing beyond optimal inhibitor concentration (Fig. 4).\n\n0.022\n\n•М. koyamae BA159769.1\n\n- Methylomonas sp.

{"chunk": "[Section: RESULTS — Part 2]\nEffect of sodium formate For achieving maximum conversion of methane to methanol, varying concentration of reducing agent in the form of sodium formate was evaluated in respective biotransformation reactions (Fig. 4F). Effect of sodium formate was evaluated in the presence of respective optimum inhibitors for selected methanotrophs. Methanol production by M. alcaliphilum increased maximum up to 307.90 mg/L at 80 mmol L /C0 1 sodium formate. No change in methanol production was observed with change in sodium formate concentration for M. methanica , whereas 20 mmol L /C0 1 of sodium formate was found to be optimum with M. silvestris producing 177.10 mg/L methanol (Fig. 4F). Methanol production by optimum MDH inhibitors (400 mmol L /C0 1 potassium phosphate and 10 mmol L /C0 1 MgCl2) and sodium formate (20 mmol L /C0 1 ) for M. trichosporium has been previously reported by Duan et al. (22).

Amongst selected four methanotrophs total speci /uniFB01 c MMO activity of M. alcaliphilum was observed to be highest at 98.40 nmol epoxypropane per minute per mg dry cells (Fig. 5A), whereas M. methanica , M. trichosporium and M. silvestris showed 32.10, 68.70 and 48 nmol epoxypropane per minute per mg dry cells, respectively. All samples were analyzed in three replicates on GC and did not observe more than 10% variation.\n\nFormate dehydrogenase activity of methanotrophs should be ensured to regenerate redox during biotransformation reaction. Activity assay of FDH enzyme from each selected methanotroph showed the ability of redox regeneration from NAD þ to NADH. Speci /uniFB01 c FDH activity of M. trichosporium was found to be highest with 1.10 U/mg of protein, whereas other methanotrophs M. methanica , M. alcaliphilum and M. silvestris were observed to have speci /uniFB01 c FDH activity of 0.14, 0.87 and 0.31 U/mg protein, respectively (Fig. 5A). Formate utilization during biotransformation was also validated by analyzing formate consumption by all four methanotrophs. Methanotrophs M. methanica , M.alcaliphilum , M. trichosporium and M. silvestris were observed to utilize 21.75%, 39.25%, 92.86% and 81.60% of formate during biotransformation with respective optimum reaction conditions, respectively.\n\nBiogas to methanol conversion Methanol production was further evaluated on biogas produced on rice straw and sugarcane bagasse. In biotransformation using biogas, methanol production decreased in all methanotrophs (Fig. 5B). Amongst all methanotrophs, M. alcaliphilum produced maximum methanol up to 204.98 mg/L and 247.37 mg/L with biogas produced from rice straw and sugarcane bagasse, respectively. In comparison of pure methane, methanol production by different methanotrophs was found to be decreased by more than 34% and 20% on biogas generated from rice straw and sugarcane bagasse, respectively.\n\nRedox regeneration for methanol production The electrons required for methane to methanol conversion could be supplied through NADH generated by sodium formate to CO2", "provenance":

{"chunk": "[Section: RESULTS — Part 3]\nconversion (26,33). Increase in sodium formate concentration affected methanol production positively but use of higher concentration of formate could not increase methanol accumulation in the presence of MDH inhibitor (16,23). To investigate this further, we estimated formate to methanol ef /uniFB01 ciency as mentioned earlier in the Materials and methods section. To evaluate redox regeneration ef /uniFB01 ciency, M. alcaliphilum was selected based on its higher methanol tolerance and methanol production ability. M. alcaliphilum was evaluated for methanol production against different sodium formate concentration in the presence and absence of ammonium chloride (Fig. 6A). Ef /uniFB01 ciency was estimated in moles of methanol produced against moles of utilized formate. In the presence of ammonium chloride, 80 mmol L /C0 1 sodium formate showed 30.59% redox regeneration ef /uniFB01 ciency, whereas in the absence of inhibitor, although increase in methanol accumulation was observed with increase in sodium formate, the redox regeneration ef /uniFB01 ciency was found to be decreasing (Fig. 6A). DCW after biotransformation reaction was analyzed and no signi /uniFB01 cant change in biomass concentration was observed, indicating formate was used only as source of reducing power and was not utilized for cell growth.\n\nMethanol production at 14 L fermentor Based on the maximum methanol tolerance and methane to methanol conversion, M. alcaliphilum was evaluated for methanol production in fermentor culture. M. alcaliphilum cells were grown on methane in 14 L fermentors and used for biotransformation reaction. Biotransformation reaction was conducted in optimized reaction mixture containing 20 mmol L /C0 1 sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8), 80 mmol L /C0 1 sodium formate, 20 mmol L -1 of ammonium chloride and M. alcaliphilum at 2 g dry cells/L. In biotransformation trials with pure methane, maximum methanol up to 418 mg/L was observed while biogas from sugarcane bagasse produced up to 331.20 mg/L methanol (Fig. 6B). Based on residual gas analysis, methane consumption up to 504.74 and 469.11 mg/L of broth was observed during biotransformation reaction with pure methane and biogas, respectively.\n\nA\n\nC\n\nE\n\nMethanol (mg/L)\n\n300\n\n100 -\n\n0\n\n300\n\n200\n\n• 100 -\n\nMethanol (mg/L)\n\n300 -\n\nMethanol (mg/L)\n\n200 -\n\n100 -\n\n1\n\n300 -\n\n₴ 200

{"chunk": "[Section: DISCUSSION — Part 1]\nMethanotrophs are known to be present in abundance across wide geographical habitats and physiological conditions (28,34). Except for the availability of methane, no other condition rationalizes the widespread abundance of methanotrophs. Cultivation at different temperature, pH, osmolarity and combination of the key factors determines the diversity of methanotroph. It is dif /uniFB01 cult to experimentally evaluate each methanotroph from wide genera and habitats to identify few ef /uniFB01 cient and industrially suitable methanotrophs for methanol production. In the present study we applied multiple segregation and selection criteria to identify representative methanotrophs based on important characteristics. Factors like physiological conditions for growth and diversity in methane utilization was used as the basis to segregate and select representative methanotrophs.\n\nTo select suitable methanotrophic strain, data of 60 aerobic methanotrophs spread over 23 genera was analyzed. Out of 60 methanotrophic strains, particulate form of methane monooxygenase was found in 56 strains and the remaining 4 strains from Methylocella and Methyloferula genus possess only soluble form of MMO for methane utilization (27,28). Methanotrophs are known to have higher methane af /uniFB01 nity and utilization when pMMO enzyme is selectively expressed (14). Considering the presence of pMMO\n\nactivity and its importance for methane utilization, pMMO based comparison of methanotroph is highly justi /uniFB01 ed. Further the sequence availability of each pMMO subunit from different methanotrophs could be useful for detailed enzyme characterisation and improvement of methane utilization ability is possible using genetic or enzyme engineering approaches. It was observed that the A1 group comprised strains from Methylomonas genus along with Methylomarinum vadi , whereas all other mesophilic gammaproteobacterium methanotrophs separated in the A2 group (Fig. 2). Although total MMO activity of methanotrophs in each sub-group can have wide variation, the diversity of pmoA sequence was used to segregate strains in different subgroups and representative from each subgroup was selected for detailed experimental investigation.\n\nTo assess methanol production ability of methanotrophs, methanol tolerance should be considered as an important aspect due to challenges associated with product inhibition. Most of the earlier studies on methanol tolerance have been done using methanol as a substrate (35,36). However, for the production of methanol, better understanding of methanol tolerance in the presence of methane is desirable. To the best of our knowledge, methanol tolerance in the presence of methane has not been investigated previously. The present study on the methanol tolerance of methanotrophs showed high tolerance both in the presence and absence of methane (Fig. 3). Interestingly, in all four selected\n\n5\n\nA\n\nA\n\nB\n\nMethanol (mg/L)\n\n100 -\n\n300\n\n50 -\n\n100 -\n\n0\n\n600\n\n300 -\n\nMethanol (mg/L)\n\nMethanol (mg/L) and\n\nMethane utilized (mg/L of broth)\n\n1.5\n\n45\n\n• 30\n\n- 1.0\n\n- 0.5\n\n0\n\n0.0\n\nM. methanica M. alcaliphilum M. trichosporium M. silvestris\n\nM. methanica\n\nM. alcaliphilum M. trichosporium\n\nM. silvestris\n\n0\n\n20\n\n40\n\n80\n\n160\n\nSodium formate (mmol)\n\n24\n\nTime (h)\n\n36\n\n15\n\n240\n\n4.5\n\n* 3.0\n\n1.5\n\nFormic acid (g/L)\n\n- 0.0\n\n48\n\n450\n\n200 -\n\n300\n\n100 -\n\n150\n\n0\n\nmethanotrophs, methanol tolerance was found to be decreasing in the presence of methane. In the absence of methane, methanol tolerance of M. alcaliphilum (6% v/v) was found to be in the similar range as reported for Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense (7% v/v) (36). Interestingly, both strains are halotolerant and belong to Methylotuvimicrobium genus. Another similar observation between M. buryatense and methanotrophs investigated in this study was achievement of maximum growth rate at 1% (v/v) methanol (Fig. 3).", "provenance": [{"docling_ref":

{"chunk": "[Section: DISCUSSION — Part 2]\nFor increasing methanol accumulation, the optimal inhibitor concentration is important for complete inhibition of MDH enzyme. Methanol production was found to be decreasing beyond the optimal inhibitor concentration (Fig. 4). This effect could be due to inhibition of MMO or formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzyme which is responsible for supplying reducing energy for MMO activity (26). On comparison of methanol production ability using pure methane, methanol production per gram of biomass by M. alcaliphilum was up to 153.95 mg methanol/g DCW, whereas M. methanica , M. trichosporium and M. silvestris produced up to 90.49, 149.33 and 88.55 mg methanol/g DCW, respectively (Fig. 4F). As all enzymes required for biotransformation are intracellular, it is important to compare methanol production ability based on speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity and methane to methanol yield. In earlier published reports, methanotrophs have been reported irrespective of important industrial parameters like tolerance, conversion yield, speci /uniFB01 c productivity and MMO activity (Table 1). In a study with M. trichosporium , maximum methanol titer up to\n\n% Redox regeneration\n\nFDH sp. activity (U/mg protein)\n\n1.10 g/L was reported with relatively lower speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity (22), whereas in the present study, use of 2 g/L dry cells of M. trichosporium resulted into 1.94 fold higher speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity up to 3.11 mg/g DCW/h. In another study with isolate from Methylocaldum genus, higher speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity and titer was reported, but the lower yield of methane to methanol conversion was achieved (Table 1). All previous studies of methanol production were performed in less than 300 mL reaction volume in serum bottles or smaller vessels (Table 1). In our studies with 3 L reaction volume M. alcaliphilum showed 41.36% and 35.35% methane to methanol molar conversion on pure methane and biogas with speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity of 8.71 and 6.90 mg/g DCW/h and yield coef /uniFB01 cient of 0.83 and 0.71 mg methanol/mg methane, respectively. Although overall carbon requirement is higher for methanol production, it could be reduced with approaches like strain engineering, improvement in MMO activity and expression of redox regeneration pathways. After the selection of industrially suitable methanotrophic strain, further enhancement in methanol production can be possible using different process modi /uniFB01 cations like use of paraf /uniFB01 n oil (37), immobilization, coculture, methane vector and cells recycling (1,18,20,25).\n\nIt was necessary to maintain favorable conditions for MMO activity during growth as well as biotransformation phase for achieving the maximum methanol production. In the present study, MMO activity of M. alcaliphilum observed to be 3.07, 1.43 and 2.05 fold higher than that of M. methanica , M. trichosporium and\n\nM. silvestris , respectively (Fig. 5A). Speci /uniFB01 c MMO activity of M. trichosporium and M. alcaliphilum was found to be in the same range as reported in the previous studies of methane utilization using these methanotrophs (29,38). One of the major factors affecting activity of enzyme is the substrate used during growth phase. Methanotrophs grown on different substrates have shown signi /uniFB01 cant variation in gene and energy regulation (35,38,39). Decrease in MMO activity of M. trichosporium on shifting substrate from methane to methanol (35) prompted maintenance of unlimiting concentration of methane and oxygen in both gas and liquid phase. Supply of fresh methane-oxygen mixture during growth phase at frequent intervals ensured continuous substrate availability in liquid phase. Biotransformation in stirred tank bioreactor improved mixing as well as gas liquid mass transfer. Continuous availability of methane and oxygen resulted in an increase up to 35% in methanol production by M. alcaliphilum as compared to that observed in serum bottles (Figs. 5B and 6B).",

A biotechnological route based on methanotrophic organisms can provide a milder and safer fermentation-based technology for methanol production from sustainable feedstocks like biogas. Considering biogas as a potential methane rich feedstock, it was evaluated for methanol production. Use of biogas reduced methanol production signi /uniFB01 cantly which could be due to the presence of CO2, H2S or any other inhibitors (Fig. 5B). Previously, conversion of biogas to methanol has been reported to be adversely affected due to the presence of impurities like H2S in biogas, as well as inconsistent composition of biogas due to variation in feed like municipal solid waste (2,41). Inhibitory effect of H2S and CO2 on methanol production was reported with other methanotrophs at H2S concentration less than 0.13% (2,12). Studies of Methylosinus sporium on pure methane produced 131.04 mg/L (4.09 mmol L /C0 1 ) methanol and remained unchanged on use of raw biogas with 20% methane concentration (12), while use of raw biogas with 30% and above methane concentration reduced the methanol production by more than 55% (1.82 mmol L /C0 1 ). In our studies with M. alcaliphilum, use of biogas (33% methane) resulted in only 19.77% reduction in methanol production (Fig. 5B). This is the /uniFB01 rst study reporting methanol production on biogas generated from second-generation feedstock like sugarcane bagasse and rice straw. Production of methanol using biogas produced from such agricultural waste can add value along with reduction in GHG emissions. Apart from valorization of methane, CO2 present in biogas is the other major GHG component present in large quantities. Conversion of CO2 to methanol can be achieved using immobilized cultures of methanotrophs as reported in previous studies (5). Other approaches like co-culture of methanotrophs with cyanobacteria can also be a promising way to utilize maximum carbon present in the biogas.\n\nOur study presents a systematic approach for selection of industrially important methanotroph for methanol production. Overall representative selection was based on information related to microbial characterization and availability of genetic data in literature. Selected representative strains from wide habitats covering multiple genera were investigated for key characteristics like product inhibition, product formation potential and variation in source of substrate. Haloalkaliphilic organism M. alcaliphilum showed high methanol tolerance and methanol production ability on pure methane as well as biogas. Further improvement in methanol production is possible with M. alcaliiphilum due to availability of the genome sequence, genome-scale model with metabolic /uniFB02 ux prediction and genetic engineering toolkit (7,38). We propose M. alcaliphilum as a potential methanotrophic platform for methanol as well as value added chemicals.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/286", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no":
