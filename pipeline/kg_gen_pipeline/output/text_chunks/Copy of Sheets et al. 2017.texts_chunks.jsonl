The purpose of this work was to develop a trickle-bed reactor (TBR) to improve mass transfer of CH4 and oxygen (O2) to methanotroph growth media for enhanced CH4 oxidation and methanol production. Mass transport of O2 in a TBR packed with ceramic balls was nearly two-fold higher than an unpacked TBR. CH4 oxidation in the TBR (0.4-0.6 mmol/h) was about four times higher than that in shake flasks that used similar inoculum and headspace:volume and biogas:air ratios. Using optimal operating parameters (biogas:air = 1:2.5, 12 mmol formate addition, 3.6 mmol phosphate), methanol productivity (0.9 g/L/d) from the non-sterile TBR was among the highest reported in the literature. Operation under non-sterile conditions caused differences in the microbial community composition between experiments, and the most predominant methanotrophs appeared to be members of the genus in which the inoculum is classified ( Methylocaldum sp. 14B).\n\n© 2017 Elsevier B.V.

However, many landfills produce biogas with flow rates (10-15 m 3 h -1 ) and CH4 contents (<30%) that are too low to implement cost-effective gas recovery systems [5-7]. Additionally, the processes to clean, store, transport, upgrade, and thermochemically convert biogas have high costs and energy demands [4]. Furthermore, the low price (<$3 per million ft 3 , industrial price) of natural gas (>90% CH4) has made the use of biogas for renewable energy unattractive [8].

Thus, MDH inhibitors and external electron donors such as formate are needed to support methanol production by methanotrophs [11]. Electrochemical catalysis and photocatalysis of CO2, direct hydrogenation of CO2, and selective oxidation of biomass are promising approaches to produce renewable and low-cost formate [13,14]. There are also several studies that have used pure cultures of methanotrophs to convert clean CH4 (>99% CH4) to methanol. However, few have used reactor design (i.e. membrane bioreactor, continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR)) to address the important issue that biological upgrading of CH4 can be limited by the low solubility and mass transport of substrate gases (CH4, O2) in methanotroph growth medium [15-17].\n\nTrickle bed reactors (TBRs) are an intriguing design for methanotroph cultivation, because they have limited power requirements, low capital costs compared to membrane bioreactors, and favorable mass transfer properties compared to CSTRs [18-20]. TBRs are cylindrical reactors packed with an inert material that has a high specific surface area [21]. Nutrient medium is circulated through the TBR to provide a thin liquid layer on the packing surface, and gases are pumped either co-current (with) or counter-current (against) to the liquid [18]. The thin liquid film has a low resistance to mass transport, allowing gases to be rapidly transferred to the biocatalyst [18]. In biological TBRs, both immobilized cells on the packing surface and suspended cells in the liquid medium have been shown to contribute in gas conversion [7,18,22,23]. TBRs have been designed for anaerobic fermentation of syngas (CO, H2) to ethanol [18]. Additionally, the continuous methanotrophic biotrickling filter is an example of a TBR used for oxidation of dilute CH4 streams (0-2%) to CO2 [7,22]. However, there are no published reports on the use of TBRs for biological conversion of biogas to methanol. Therefore, the objective of this study was to develop a TBR for CH4 conversion and methanol production from biogas. The TBR was inoculated with a mixed culture containing methanotrophs classified in the genus Methylocaldum , and was operated non-sterilely throughout the study. Several operating conditions were varied to test the performance and robustness of the TBR. Subsequently, the microbial community in the TBR at different operating phases was investigated.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/20", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l":

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.3.2. Phase 1.2: impacts of biogas: air ratio]\nOn day 21 of Phase 1, the CH4 source for the TBR was changed to biogas. The TBR was fed with biogas at three different biogas:air ratios to determine the effects of initial CH4 content on reactor performance. The three biogas:air ratios evaluated were 1:6.0 (10% CH4, days 21.0-24.0, day 27.0-27.5), 1:2.5 (20% CH4, days 24.0-27.0), and 1:28.0 (2% CH4, days 27.5-28.0). For biogas:air ratios of 1:6.0 and 1:2.5, biogas was fed every 8-12 h for three consecutive days. The use of biogas:air ratio of 1:6.0 on day 27.0-27.5 was to ensure that the same headspace CH4 content (10%) was used prior to each change in biogas:air ratio. At the biogas:air ratio of 1:28.0, biogas was fed once every 4 h for 12 h. Headspace gas composition was measured at 0, 2, and 4 h for each biogas:air ratio. At higher biogas:air ratios (1:2.5, 1:6.0), headspace gas composition was also measured at 8-12 h and 24 h. The average and standard deviation of CH4 removal, O2 removal, and CO2 production at 4 h were used to compare the rate of gas removal at different biogas:air ratios. Based on results obtained in Phase 1.1 (Section 3.1.1), the liquid volume and NMS medium dilution rate in Phase 1.2 were set at 70 mL and 1.0 d -1 , respectively. Liquid and gas circulation rates were set at 50 mL/min and 80 mL/min, respectively.\n\nAfter Phase 1.2, preliminary experiments were conducted to determine which levels of phosphate buffer (MDH inhibitor), for-\n\nmate (electron donor), NMS medium dilution rate (d -1 ), and biogas:air ratio were needed to promote methanol production in the TBR. Additionally, a sample of TBR fluid (OD ≈ 0.2) during these preliminary tests was removed to determine whether free cells could be used for biogas to methanol conversion. The liquid sample was centrifuged (10,000 rpm for 10 min) and resuspended in 8 mL phosphate buffer (10 times the concentration listed in Section 2.3.1) with 80 mM formate to reach an initial OD of ∼ 0.5. The 8 mL sample was split into two 4 mL samples, which were transferred to 40 mL test tubes. Rubber stoppers were added and biogas was added directly at a biogas to air ratio of 1:2. The two 40 mL test tubes were incubated at 37 ◦ C. After four hours, a 1 mL liquid sample from each 40 mL tube was filtered (0.2 𝛍 m) and the filtrate was subjected to methanol analysis via GC.\n\nAfter Phase 1, the free space of the reactor was not measured in order to best preserve the loosely attached biomass on the packed bed. The ceramic balls with attached biomass were removed and characterized by visual observation. The packed bed biomass density (g/g balls) was determined by re-suspending the attached biomass of a representative sample of the ceramic balls from the packed bed in a known volume of DI water (250 mL) and the suspended biomass/water sample was subjected to dry weight analysis. The total biomass (g) in the representative sample was calculated by multiplying the mass of DI water added to the sample to the average suspended biomass/water dry weight (g/g). Then, the packed bed biomass density (g biomass/g balls) was calculated by dividing the total biomass from the sample by the mass of balls in the sample. The total mass of ceramic balls added to the reactor (2.42 kg) was calculated by multiplying the specific gravity of the ceramic balls (2.3 g/cm 3 ) by the empty volume of the packed bed portion of the reactor (1.05 L). The total dry attached biomass in the TBR after Phase 1 was calculated by multiplying the packed bed biomass density (g dry biomass/kg balls) by the mass of ceramic balls added to the reactor (2.42 kg). After the ceramic balls were removed, the reactor was cleaned several times with 70% ethanol followed by DI water. Fresh ceramic balls were added to the TBR and the packed bed was pre-wetted with DI water before the second inoculation (Section 2.4, Phase 2.1).", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/49", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 312.221, "t": 276.8650122070312, "r": 563.768, "b": 70.70101220703123, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/50", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 312.221, "t": 67.65001220703118, "r": 563.767, "b": 49.78001220703118, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/53", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 4, "bbox": {"l": 31.922, "t": 738.4740122070313, "r": 283.468, "b": 593.2740122070312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/54", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 4, "bbox": {"l": 31.922, "t": 590.2220122070312, "r": 283.469, "b": 342.2150122070312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "2.3.2.

The procedure was started by pumping air through the TBR for 20 min to remove residual biogas and provide O2. Then, the volume of free liquid was measured with a syringe and NMS medium was supplied to reach approximately 70 mL. Subsequently, 12 or\n\n18 mL of liquid was removed from the TBR (depending on the necessary amount to maintain the total volume), and 6 mL of 0.6 M phosphate buffer (3.6 mmol) and 6 mL or 12 mL of 1 M sodium formate (6 or 12 mmol) were added. Then, biogas was fed at the desired biogas:air ratio (1:2.5 or 1:6.0), and the TBR was operated for 10 h with liquid and gas circulation rates set at 50 mL/min and 80 mL/min, respectively. CH4, O2, and CO2 concentrations in the headspace, and methanol and formate concentrations in the liquid, were measured at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 10 h. After each 10-h methanol production phase, the reactor was washed three times with DI water at high liquid circulation rates (>100 mL/min) to remove residual methanol and formate (validated by GC and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), respectively). Prior to starting another methanol production test, the 12 or 18 mL of TBR liquid medium that was removed at the beginning of a test was put back into the TBR, NMS was added to reach a volume of 70 mL, and then the reactor was operated until the liquid OD again reached ∼ 0.2. This method of dilution was used because it mimicked the dilution strategy used in Phase 2.1 to accumulate free cells needed for methanol production. This method could potentially be implemented at large scale due to low cost.

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.5. Control experiments and mass transfer analysis]\nA control experiment was set up to compare biogas oxidation using shake flasks with similar headspace:liquid volume (VH:VL) ratios to the TBR (VH:VL = 16.7:1.0). First, a small sample of the TBR liquid medium from Phase 1.2 was diluted in NMS medium in a 550 mL shake flask, biogas was added at a 1:6.0 biogas:air ratio, and the flask was agitated at 200 rpm until CH4 removal was verified. A small amount of this culture was then diluted in 70 mL of fresh NMS medium to reach an initial OD of 0.05, then placed into 1.16 L shake flasks equipped with a rubber stopper (VH:VL = 15.6:1.0). Biogas was then added to the 1.16 L shake flasks at biogas:air ratios of either 1:2.5 or 1:6.0. The flasks were incubated in the same incubator as the TBR, and were shaken at 200 rpm for 24 h. Headspace CH4, O2, and CO2 contents were measured at 0, 10, and 24 h to determine gas removal and production rates. This control experiment was performed in duplicate.\n\nTo determine the impact of the packed bed on reactor performance, the TBR was operated under normal conditions, except the packed bed was removed (VH = 1950 mL). After removal of the packed bed, the TBR was supplied with an actively growing methanotrophic culture in NMS medium (OD = 0.25, VL = 70 mL) that used TBR liquid medium from Phase 1.2 as inoculum (stored at 4 ◦ C, incubated at 37 ◦ C in shake flasks prior to use). At the beginning of each experiment, the TBR liquid medium was diluted in NMS medium to reach an initial OD of approximately 0.2, and biogas was fed to the TBR at a 1:2.5 biogas:air ratio. Gas composition was measured after 8-14 h. The average and standard deviation of TBR performance parameters (gas removal, change in OD) over two days of operation were compared to results from Phase 1.2. The liquid and gas flow rates of the TBR were set at 50 mL/min and 80 mL/min, respectively.\n\nThe abiotic volumetric mass transfer coefficient for O2 (KLA/VL) in the TBR was determined based on the methodology outlined in Orgill et al. [28]. The schematic of the TBR was the same as shown in Fig. 1, except a custom 220 mL flow-through cell with dissolved oxygen (DO) probe (ProODO, YSI Inc, Yellow Springs, OH, USA) was included in-line with the liquid circulation tubing. DI water was used as the liquid medium in the TBR, and the reactor was operated under the same incubation condition used in Phases 1-2. When necessary, fresh ceramic balls were added\n\nto the TBR. Two scenarios were compared: (1) operation with packed bed (VL = 340 mL, VH = 1120 mL), and (2) operation without packed bed but with the same liquid volume as Scenario 1 (VL = 340 mL, VH = 1900 mL). First, the TBR was purged with N2 at 80 mL/min until the DO in the liquid (circulating at 50 mL/min) was near 0 mg/L. Then, ambient air was introduced to the TBR (80 mL/min) and DO levels in the DI water were recorded every 30 s using the DO probe. The volumetric mass transfer coefficient for O2 (KLA/VL) was calculated according to Eq. (1) [28]:\n\nwhere KL is the mass transfer coefficient (m/h), A is the mass transfer area (m 2 ), VL is the total volume of liquid added to the TBR (m 3 ), CL * is the saturating DO concentration (mol/m 3 ) at the operating temperature, CL is the DO concentration measured in the flowthrough cell (mol/m 3 ), and t is time (h) [28].

The methanol content of filtered (0.2 𝛍 m) samples of TBR liquid medium were analyzed by a GC with a flame ionization detector (FID) (Shimadzu, 2010Plus, Columbia, MD, USA) according to methods in Sheets et al. [26]. Formate in filtered (0.2 𝛍 m) samples of TBR liquid medium was analyzed using a LC-20 AB HPLC system (Shimadzu, Columbia, MD, USA) with a RID-10A refractive index detector (RID) and a RFQ-Fast Fruit H + (8%) column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). The mobile phase was 2.5 mM H2SO4 operated at a flow rate of 0.4 mL/min. The column and RID temperatures were maintained at 60 ◦ C and 55 ◦ C, respectively [29]. The concentration of formate (M) was determined using a standard curve developed using several different standard solutions of sodium formate. The composition of headspace gas (CH4, O2, CO2, N2) was analyzed by a GC equipped with a thermal conductivity detector (TCD) according to methods described in Sheets et al. [30]. Throughout the experiments, only minor reductions in headspace pressure were observed; therefore, CH4 removal (mmol/h) was calculated according to Eq. (2):\n\nwhere CH4,0 is the initial headspace concentration (%), CH4,t is the headspace concentration at time t (%), VH is the headspace volume (mL), t is time (h), and 25.4 is the molar volume of gases at 37 ◦ C (mL/mmol). O2 removal was calculated the same way, except that headspace O2 concentrations were used in place of CH4 concentrations. The TBR produced CO2, so CO2,0 and CO2,t had to be swapped in Eq. (2) to calculate CO2 production (mmol/h). Volumetric CH4 removal (mmol/L/h) was calculated as the CH4 removal (mmol/h) divided by the total volume of liquid in the TBR system (VL). Methanol productivity (g/L/d) was determined by dividing the methanol content (g/L) by the cultivation time. CH4to-methanol conversion (%) and formate-to-methanol conversion (%) were determined by dividing the amount of methanol produced (mmol) by the amount of CH4 or formate consumed (mmol).

Microbial community analysis]\nThe microbial community of the TBR at different phases was analyzed to determine how operational conditions may have impacted the bacteria involved in CH4 oxidation. Samples of circulation fluid (>1 mL per sample) were taken at the end of Phase 1.1 (day 20 of P1), the end of Phase 1.2 (day 28 of P1), and the end of Phase 2.2 (day 20 of P2). Additionally, one sample of the inoculum for Phase 2 (day 16 of Phase 1.1) and one sample from the end of Phase 2.1 (day 5) were taken to assess any changes in community composition within Phase 2. Each sample was centrifuged at 16,000 × g for 1 min to pellet the microbial biomass. Metagenomic DNA was extracted from each sample pellet using the repeated bead beating plus column purification (RBB + C) method as described in Yu and Morisson [31]. The quality of the DNA extracts was checked using agarose gel (0.8%) electrophoresis, and the DNA concentrations were quantified using a Quant-iT TM dsDNA Assay Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). One amplicon library was prepared from each DNA extract using primers 515F and 806R that amplify the V4-V5 hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene of both bacteria and archaea. All the amplicons were sequenced using 2 × 300 paired-end kits on the Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) at the OARDC Molecular and Cellular Imaging Center (Wooster, OH, USA) [32]. The sequencing data were analyzed using Quantitative Insights Into Microbial Ecology (QIIME) open-source software (v 1.9.0) [33] and the protocols described previously [32]. Briefly, bases with a quality score of less than 25 were trimmed off from each sequencing read, and then the two paired reads were joined to a single sequence using the fastq-join script [34]. The barcodes and primers were further trimmed from each sequence. Sequences shorter than 248 bp after trimming were discarded. Chimera sequences were identified using the ChimeraSlayer algorithm [35]. Species-equivalent operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were identified by comparing the representative sequence of each OTU to the Silva 119 release reference sequences (http://www.arb-silva.de/download/archive/ qiime/) at 97% similarity (pick open reference otus.py) using the uclust algorithm [36]. Minor OTUs were filtered out if they were each represented by less than 0.005% of the total sequences [37] or were less than 0.1% in any of the samples. The sequences were deposited in the Genbank SRA database with the accession number SRP090502. A summary of sampling information, sequencing, quality checking/sequence removal, and OTU clustering are shown in Table A1. Relative abundances of taxa (phylum and order level) from each Phase were compared using one-way ANOVA using JMP statistical software.

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.1.1. Phase 1.1: determination of optimal operating parameters using purified CH4]\nOne week after the TBR was inoculated with strain 14B, the CH4 content in the headspace typically declined from 13% to 0-3% within only 10-16 h of incubation (Fig. 2). Additionally, both loosely and strongly attached biomass were observed on the ceramic balls and the liquid medium in the reactor had the same characteristic brown color of a pure culture of Methylocaldum sp. 14B [26]. This indicated that a predominantly methanotrophic microbial community was forming in the TBR, because no other carbon source than\n\nGas composition (%)\n\nGas removal or production (mmol/h)\n\n25%\n\nMethane-initial\n\nMethane-final\n\n• Methane removal\n\nOD\n\n1.00\n\nE Oxygen removal\n\n• Carbon dioxide production\n\n1.0\n\n0.6\n\na Purified CH4 (>99%) used as CH4 source.\n\nb Period of reactor failure.\n\n1:2.5\n\nc Circulated 70 mL of fresh NMS medium to wet packed bed prior to incubation.\n\nCH4 was provided to the reactor [6]. Very slight differences in CH4 removal (0.26-0.40 mmol/h) at variable gas and liquid flow rates (Table 2, days 6-11) were likely because the apparent gas and liquid velocities tested in this study were too low (UL = 0.3-2.4 m/h, Ug = 0.6-2.4 m/h) to influence gas-liquid mass transfer in the TBR [6,21,38]. Although higher flow rates can improve mass transport, they were not attainable in this study because higher gas velocities caused heat damage to the gas circulation tubing and higher liquid velocities contributed to clogging of the packed bed. Still, CH4 removal (0.26-0.44 mmol/h) during Phase 1.1 was 8-13 times higher than that by a 50 mL pure culture of Methylocaldum sp. 14 B previously cultivated in 250 mL flasks under rigorous shaking (200 rpm) (0.034 mmol/h) and similar OD (0.05-0.3) [26].\n\nCH4 removal drastically declined from days 11-13 (0-0.09 mmol/h) while O2 removal (0.17-0.20 mmol/h) and CO2 production (0.08-0.11 mmol/h) declined slightly (Fig. 2) (Table 2). It was likely that inhibition was caused by insufficient nutrients in the TBR [6,39]. These claims are supported because reactor performance quickly recovered after the entire TBR liquid medium was replaced with fresh NMS medium (day 12.5) and the NMS medium dilution rate was increased (Table 2, days 13-16). The most stable flow, without clogging and/or bubbling, was observed when the liquid circulation rate was set at 50 mL/min, the gas circulation rate was set at 80 mL/min, and the liquid volume was controlled at 70 mL (days 16.5-19.5). Based on visual observation, the liquid in the packed bed formed thin rivulets and more brown biomass appeared in regions where the thin rivulets formed. There was also a nominal increase in OD of the TBR liquid medium (0.06-0.3) as headspace CH4 content declined (Fig. 2) (days 16.5-19.5). Under these conditions, less than 10 mL of the liquid was retained in the bottom of the TBR, and gas bubbles were not observed in the liquid circulation line. Interestingly, at 4 hours\n\nCH4 removal was observed when liquid circulation was turned off (Table 2, day 19.6-20.5), indicating that both attached and suspended methanotroph cells contributed to CH4 removal [22].

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.1.2. Phase 1.2: effect of biogas:air ratio on TBR performance and control experiments]\nThe CH4 removal rates observed in Phase 1.1 were sustained after the CH4 source was switched to biogas (Fig. 2) (days 22-28, NMS medium dilution rate = 1 d -1 ), suggesting that the CO2 and H2S in the biogas did not have a major impact on the CH4 oxidizing capacity of the methanotrophic TBR. Similar to Phase 1.1, the OD of the liquid medium increased as CH4 content in the headspace declined. Operation at the lowest biogas:air ratio caused the highest OD (0.5-0.6) observed during Phase 1.2 (Fig. 2) (day 27). The color of the suspended cells shifted from brown in Phase 1.1 to white in Phase 1.2. There was a significant linear increase (ANOVA, p < 0.05) in the rate of O2 removal and CH4 removal by increasing biogas:air ratios from 1:28.0 to 1:6.0, while similar gas oxidation was observed at biogas:air ratios of 1:6.0 and 1:2.5 (Fig. 3). Similarly, maximum volumetric CH4 removal in the TBR at 4 h was\n\nobserved for the biogas:air ratio of 1:2.5 (8.4 ± 1.1 mmol/L/h), followed by the biogas:air ratio of 1:6.0 (6.0 ± 1.3 mmol/L/h), and the lowest volumetric removal was observed at the biogas:air ratio of 1:28.0 (2.9 ± 0.3 mmol/L/h).\n\nEnhanced CH4 removal at higher biogas:air ratios was because higher CH4 content in the headspace provided a higher equilibrium CH4 concentration in the liquid. Therefore, the rate of CH4 removal was likely controlled by gas-to-liquid mass transfer under the operating conditions evaluated in this study [40]. This is also supported by the fact that CH4 removal at the 1:28 biogas:air ratio was fairly low (2% CH4, 2.86 mmol/L/h) compared to a study by Estrada et al. [6] that used a continuous methanotrophic biotrickling filter that treated gas at similar initial CH4 content (2% CH4), had polyurethane foam packing with high specific surface area (1000 m 2 /m 3 ), and was operated at high liquid velocity (5-15 m/h) (7-8 mmol/L/h CH4 removal, 1.2-1.4 L liquid volume, 4L packed bed volume, used bacterial consortia dominated by type I and type II methanotrophs). This improved performance demonstrated by Estrada et al. [6] was probably because gas-to-liquid mass transfer for sparingly soluble substrates (i.e. O2, CH4) is enhanced at higher liquid velocities when packings with high specific surface area are employed [41]. Trade-offs between enhanced mass transfer using different flow rates/tower packings and their associated costs need to be evaluated via techno-economic analysis.\n\nThe maximum volumetric CH4 removal (8.4 ± 1.1 mmol/L/h) in the TBR was comparable to a recent study that applied a 2.5 L CSTR (1L working volume, 10% CH4 in headspace) in batch mode with significant agitation (1000 rpm) for Methylomicrobium buryatense 5G cultivation (7.6 mmol/L/h) [42]. CH4 removal in the TBR at biogas:air ratios of 1:2.5 and 1:6.0 were three to four times higher than the shake flask control tests that were operated at a similar VH:VL ratio (200 rpm, 1.8-2.1 mmol/L/h) (Section 2.5). This indicates that TBRs could offer significant energy savings compared to CSTRs [18]. Additionally, the abiotic KLA/VL for O2 increased approximately two-fold when the packed bed was included in the reactor (Table 3). Furthermore, the CH4 removal, O2 removal, and CO2 production for the biotic control test (no packed bed, inoculated with similar methanotrophic culture at similar initial OD) were approximately two times lower than the results obtained in Phase 1.2 (Table 3). The higher abiotic mass transfer coefficient and CH4 removal rates in Scenario 1 of the control tests showed that the presence of the TBR packing material improved gas-liquid mass transport and gas oxidation (Table 3) [6,28]. For comparison, the abiotic KLA obtained in Scenario 1 (8.7-10.4 h -1 ) was only slightly lower than that (14-16 h -1 ) reported by Orgill et al. [28], who used similar packing materials, design dimensions, and gas (73 mL/min) and liquid circulation (50 mL/min) rates. Future studies should evaluate different packing materials to optimize reactor performance in methanotrophic TBRs [7,18,41].", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/105", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 301.411, "t": 193.17901220703118, "r": 552.959, "b": 49.78001220703118, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/108", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 7, "bbox": {"l": 42.732, "t": 737.6330122070312, "r": 294.277, "b": 692.3040122070312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/109", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 7, "bbox": {"l": 42.731, "t": 695.2960122070313, "r": 294.279, "b": 489.1320122070312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/110", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 7, "bbox": {"l": 42.732, "t": 486.5750122070312, "r": 294.279, "b": 227.61301220703126, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "3.1.2.

However, when bacteria from the TBR were allowed to propagate until the liquid had an OD higher than 0.1, the addition of formate and phosphate caused detectable methanol concentrations in the TBR liquid medium. Additionally, the methanol production test in 40 mL shake flasks (Section 2.3.2) showed that the free cells could produce 0.26 g/L of methanol in approximately 4 h. These results indicated that the presence of free cells were needed to induce methanol formation in the TBR.

These results indicate that attached cells had a significant role in CH4 oxidation in the TBR. It is possible that attached cells also contributed to methanol production during preliminary tests, but was probably rapidly consumed by other microbes in the biofilm matrix, and the net methanol produced was below the detection limit of the GC (LOD = 0.001 g/L).

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.2.2. Phase 2.2: effects of biogas and formate on methanol production]\nDespite operating under non-sterile conditions, methanol production was achievable in the TBR (Figs. A1 and 4). The highest methanol content ( ∼ 0.28 g/L) was observed at a high biogas:air ratio (1:2.5) and a high formate addition (12 mmol) (Fig. A1-days 7 and 9, Fig. 4a). Under those conditions, there was sufficient CH4 and reducing power (formate) to sustain methanol production for the 10-h incubation period (Fig. 4a). At the same biogas:air ratio (1:2.5) and a lower formate level (6 mmol), methanol production peaked at 4 h (0.14 g/L), but declined rapidly thereafter (Fig. 4b). This is because the formate was almost completely consumed after 6 h, which limited the amount of reducing equivalents available for biogas to methanol conversion (Fig. 4b) [11,43]. To maintain viability, the microbes in the TBR had to use methanol as a source of carbon and energy [26]. Similar methanol production kinetics were observed at a low biogas:air ratio (1:6.0) and a high formate (12 mmol) addition, except that methanol production peaked at 6 h (0.17 g/L) (Fig. 4c). In this case, there was sufficient formate in the TBR liquid medium, but CH4 in the headspace declined to 3% (Fig. 4c). Insufficient CH4 in the TBR could have caused the microbial community to use formate and methanol as its primary carbon sources, which explains the observed reduction in formate and methanol after 6 h (Fig. 4c). The combined effects of insuffi-\n\nb 8 h gas removal and production data from days 24 to 26 of Phase 1.2 (biogas:air ratio = 1:2.5).\n\nTable\n\n4\n\nMethanol production\n\nefficiencies at\n\ndifferent biogas:air\n\nratios and\n\nformate additions.\n\na Conversion at 6 h incubation time.\n\ncient formate and insufficient CH4 were the reason for the lowest methanol content (0.05-0.07 g/L) observed at a low biogas:air ratio (1:6.0) and a low formate (6 mmol) addition (Fig. A1-days 15 and 17, Fig. 4d). Additionally, lower CH4:O2 ratios have been shown to limit production of excreted products and promote conditions for balanced growth (i.e. higher biomass and CO2 production) in methanotrophic enrichment cultures [10]. This could also explain the higher OD (0.5-0.6) observed at the lowest biogas:air ratio during Phase 1.2 (Fig. 2, day 27.5-28.0). Based on the aforementioned results, it is not surprising that the higher biogas:air ratio and higher formate addition caused higher CH4 to methanol and formate to methanol conversion ratios (Table 4).\n\nUnder optimal conditions (biogas:air = 1:2.5, formate addition = 12 mmol), both methanol productivity (0.9 g/L/d) and CH4 to methanol conversion (22.4%) in the non-sterile TBR were in the upper range of reported values for pure methanotroph cultures [11]. Additionally, the results from Phase 2.2 suggest that methanol production is feasible using non-sterile methanotrophic consortia and raw biogas. This could drastically reduce reactor sterilization and biogas cleaning requirements, thus decreasing operational costs and energy demands. However, Phase 2.2 revealed some issues that need to be addressed prior to scale up. Unstable methanol production after day 20 was presumably because formate and methanol-consuming microbes became prevalent in the TBR. After the system recovered (day 28), formate consumption was high. Furthermore, maximum formate to methanol conversion in the study (12-13%) was low (Table 4). In an ideal scenario in which MDH is completely inhibited and all electrons produced from formate dehydrogenase went to CH4 oxidation, the theoretical conversion of formate (and CH4) to methanol would be 100%. This shows that low formate yields significantly impact the economic feasibility of CH4 to methanol conversion; thus, formate costs must be reduced or alternative electron donors are needed [11]. In the short term, formate costs could be substantially reduced to ∼ $200/MT if lower cost electricity produced during off-peak hours was used to electro-chemically reduce concentrated CO2 from industrial sources [14].

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.3. Microbial community — Part 1]\nMore than 33,000 quality-checked sequences were obtained from the samples (Table A1), and 92-98% of the obtained DNA sequences were assigned to known bacterial phyla, with the most dominant being Proteobacteria (62-86%) and Bacteroidetes (0.2-8.7%) (Fig. 5) (Tables A1 and A3). Other major phyla (each represented by ≥ 2% of total sequence in at least one sample) included Cyanobacteria (0.4-8.9%), Chlorobi (0-6.4%), and Gemmatimonadetes (0-3.7%), while Chloroflexi, Firmicutes , and Actinobacteria were detected as minor phyla. There were significant differences in the number of OTUs that had order-level taxonomic assignment between each operating phase (Fig. 5) (Table A3). One of the most predominant orders from Phases 1.1 and 2.2 was Methylococcales , which contains methylotrophic bacteria that can only consume one-carbon compounds (Fig. 5) [27,45]. Methylococcales had the greatest relative abundance in Phase 2.2, followed by Phase 1.1, which was higher than Phase 1.2 samples (Table A3). Additionally, Methylocaldum , the genus of the inoculum within Methylococcales , was the most predominant methanotrophic genus in all phases (Table 5).\n\nApparently, the operating conditions used in Phase 2.2 allowed Methylocaldum spp. to dominate the reactor and produce methanol, despite the fact that the non-sterile inoculum had low relative abundance of Methylococcales (Table A2). This was most likely due to the low dilution rates and supplementation of formate and phosphate used during Phase 2.2 compared to Phase 1 (Table 1). Additionally, the inoculum for Phase 2.2 was sampled directly after the CH4 oxidation rate in the TBR was recovered.

Although only a small amount (26.7%) of the sequences from the Phase 1.1 and 1.2 samples were classified to known genera (Table 5), the orders Burkholderiales, Rickettsiales, Rhodospirales, and Rhizobiales were very prevalent in those samples (Fig. 5). There were high amounts of Rhizobiales , which contains the metabolically versatile type II methanotrophic genera Methylocystis and Methylosinus [27,45]. In fact, there were significantly (p < 0.05, Tukey HSD) more sequences identified as Rhizobiales in Phase 1.2 than in the other phases (Fig. 5) (Table A3). Therefore, it is possible that the high dilution rates and variable biogas:air ratios applied in Phase 1.2 caused type II methylotrophs to outcompete the type I methanotrophs present in the original inoculum. In fact, type II methylotrophs are known to survive in variable growth conditions by producing polyhydroxybutyrate (PHB) as a carbon storage compound [46]. This indicates that the high dilution rates used in Phase 1.2 could be applicable for PHB producing strains in methanotrophic TBRs. Still, no type II methanotrophic genera were detected. Phase 1 samples also had greater relative abundance of methanol-utilizing bacteria (i.e. Burkholderiales , Rhodospirillales) than other phases (Fig. 5) (Table A3) [45]. Synergism between methanol-oxidizing bacteria and methanotrophs is a common observation in methanotrophic enrichments [10].", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/138", "label": "text", "pages":

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.3. Microbial community — Part 2]\nThe other major bacterial genera identified from Phase 1 ( Sedimimibacterium, Phaeospirillum, Limnohabitans, Agrobacterium, Ralstonia ) probably survived on metabolic byproducts (i.e. acetate/methanol) produced by methanotrophs, because no other carbon source than CH4/biogas was supplied during that phase [10,47]. Previously, Bothe et al. [50] identified Ralstonia as a common genus that grows in association with methanotrophs, likely because it consumes acetate produced by the methanotrophs. Meanwhile, Sediminibacterium and Limnohabitans have been identified in other methanotrophic samples and in a coalpacked CH4-biofilter [48,49]. Furthermore, Rhizobiales (the order that contains Agrobacterium ) has been shown to stimulate methanotrophic activity by supplying vitamins that promote the growth of methanotrophs [50]. The supply of formate could have contributed to growth of the Flavobacterium or other formate-consuming microbes in Phase 2.2 (Table 5) [10]. The microbial community samples were based on free cells in the TBR recirculation fluid. Although the total microbial population was probably similar, the relative ratios of microbes in free and immobilized biomass were likely different because of variable CH4 and O2 gradients and oxygen stresses in the biofilm (i.e. micro-aerobic, anaerobic conditions) [51].\n\n30%\n\nHeadspace CH, content (%)\n\nMethane-initial\n\nMethane-final\n\nOD\n\n→ Methanol\n\nAt the current state of the technology, biological conversion of biogas to methanol is unlikely to be economically feasible due to the low reported yields (<1 g/L). However, this study shows that TBRs have good mass transfer properties, and can potentially be used to cultivate methanotrophs for cell-based products such as biopolymers and single cell protein, or for other excreted compounds such as lactic acid [52]. Continued research on TBRs for CH4 conversion could lead to unique designs that have substantial cost advantages compared to conventional equipment such as CSTRs. Specifically, future work should evaluate the effects of operational conditions (flow rates, operational time) on the development and stability of methanotrophic biofilms.
