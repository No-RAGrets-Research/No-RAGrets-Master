{"chunk": "[Section: 1. Introduction — Part 1]\nOverpopulation and economic development have led to increased greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the pre-industrial era, resulting in unprecedented levels of atmospheric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The consequent effect has been reflecting through global climate change and enhanced global warming since the mid-20th century. Worldwide anthropogenic emission of CO2 has almost hit 43.1 billion tonnes (Global Carbon Project Budget, 2019). Methane has a global warming potential 28 -36 times that of CO2 over a 100-year-timescale (US EPA, 2020). Furthermore, the global emission of methane stands at 570 million tonnes, of which 342 million tonnes is accounted for by anthropogenic sources, while the residual 228 million tonnes  originate  from  natural  reserves  ( e.g. ,  wetlands,  sediments, oceans,  termites,  biodegradation  of  organic  wastes  by  methanogens, etc.) (IEA, Methane Tracker, 2020). There are ongoing efforts to transform these greenhouse gases into various value-added chemicals such as formaldehyde, ethanol, methanol, acetic acid, and formic acid (Wang\n\nA B S T R A C T\n\nThe study demonstrates a two-stage integrated process for bio-methanol production using Methylosinus trichosporium NCIMB 11131, coupled with sequestration of methane and carbon dioxide. The first stage involved generation of methanotrophic biomass via sequestration of methane; which was used as biocatalyst to reduce carbon dioxide into methanol in the second stage. Maximum biomass titer of 3.39 g L GLYPH<0> 1 and productivity of 0.60 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 were achieved in semi-batch stirred tank reactor with methane concentration in the inlet gas mixture of 2.5% v/v and gas flow rate of 0.5 vvm. Methane fixation rate was estimated to be 0.32 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 . Maximum methanol titer of 0.58 g L GLYPH<0> 1 was achieved at headspace carbon dioxide concentration of 50% v/v and liquid to headspace volume ratio 10:90. Subsequently, a kinetic model was developed to predict and understand the system  behaviour  in  terms  of  dynamic  profile  of  growth,  methanol  formation,  concentration  of  dissolved methane or carbon dioxide in the aqueous phase and headspace carbon dioxide concentration, in response to varying process parameters. The model can serve as a tool for estimation of process parameters and aid in overall production optimization.\n\net al., 2017). Methanol, a widely used industrial solvent, is also known to be the precursor for synthesizing other chemicals like formaldehyde, acetic acid, dimethyl ether, and methyl tert-butyl ether (MTBE) (Dalena et al., 2018). Methanol is being considered as a potential transportation fuel owing to its high specific energy ratio, high heat of vaporization, low  combustion  temperature,  high  flame  speed  and  so  on  (Verhelst et al., 2019). Although CH4  is also used as a fuel, methanol stands superior to CH4  in several ways: (i) methanol is a liquid at STP, which facilitates  easy  and  safe  storage  and  transportation  with  minimum product loss; (ii) methanol possesses 488-times greater volumetric energy content (15,871 MJ m GLYPH<0> 3 )  as  compared  to  CH4  (32.50  MJ  m GLYPH<0> 3 ) (Verhelst et al., 2019).\n\nMethanol  can  be  produced  through  chemical  or  biological  route. Chemical synthesis of methanol may be achieved either through catalytic oxidation of CH4 or via catalytic hydrogenation of CO2. However, the conventionally used chemical routes for methanol production are constrained  by  the  requirement  of:  (i)  expensive  catalysts e.g. ,  CuO/ ZnO/Al2O3, Fe2O3(MoO3)3, MoO3/SiO2, MoO3/Ga2O3, V2O5/SiO2, etc .\n\nGLYPH<c=20,font=/KMWKYR+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT>GLYPH<c=20,font=/KMWKYR+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT>GLYPH<c=22,font=/KMWKYR+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT>GLYPH<c=28,font=/KMWKYR+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT>GLYPH<c=21,font=/KMWKYR+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT>GLYPH<c=26,font=/KMWKYR+TimesNewRomanPS-ItalicMT>", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/12", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 37.587, "t": 319.2009997695312, "r": 291.033, "b": 155.02099976953116, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/13", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 201.997, "t": 503.8599997695312, "r": 269.147, "b": 497.4629997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/14", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 201.997, "t": 484.4919997695312, "r": 559.796, "b": 372.6899997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/15", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 306.595, "t": 340.1179997695312, "r": 560.022, "b": 217.7789997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/16", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 306.598, "t": 214.60199976953118, "r": 560.011, "b": 155.01999976953118, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/19", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 444.275, "t": 756.4189997695312, "r": 477.759, "b": 750.1929997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "1.

Alternatively, methanol can be produced biologically with the application of methanotrophic microorganisms as biocatalyst. Authors  have reported various methanotrophic strains e.g. , Methylosinus trichosporium , Methylosinus sporium , Methyloferula stellata , Methylomicrobium  album , Methylocella  tundrae , Methylocystis  bryophila (Xin et al., 2007; Mardina et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2016b; Patel et al., 2020a, b, c), etc. for methanol production using noxious C1-carbon compounds, like CH4  and CO2. Biological methods are advantageous over chemical methods as they operate under mild process conditions, without using expensive chemical catalysts; have low energy requirement, and higher conversion  efficiency,  accompanied  with  greater  stability  and  selectivity,  and  hence  may  offer  better  economic  feasibility;  and  are eco-friendly.\n\nMethanotrophs are Gram-negative proteobacteria that utilize methane as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth. Methane, bio-sequestered by methanotrophs, is catalytically oxidized into methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO), an endogenous irreversible enzyme. The produced methanol is subsequently converted into formaldehyde, formate, and CO2 via sequential oxidations catalysed by three reversible  enzymes:  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH),  formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase, respectively (Sahoo et al., 2021).  A  part  of  the  intermediately  produced  formaldehyde/formate assimilates  into  the  biomass  as  a  carbon  source  via  RuMP  or  serine pathway. MMO is classified into two types: particulate MMO (integrated on the cell membrane), and soluble MMO (produced in the cytoplasm). Particulate MMO shows elevated expression at high copper to biomass ratios, while the expression of soluble MMO increases under low copper to biomass ratios and high titre of iron ions. Soluble MMO causes faster methane oxidation relative to particulate MMO, owing to the higher substrate specificity of soluble MMO for methane (Sahoo et al., 2021). Methanotrophs are broadly classified into three types on the basis of the type of MMO synthesized. Type I methanotrophs ( e.g. , species of Methylosoma , Methylothermus , Methylosarcina , Methylosphaera , Methylohalobius , Methylomonas , Methylobacter , Methylomicrobium , Crenothrix and Clonothrix ) express particulate MMO; Type II methanotrophs ( e.g. , species  of Methylocapsa , Methylocella , Methylosinus and Methylocystis ) express both soluble and particulate MMO; and Type X methanotrophs ( e.g. , species of Methylococcus and Methylocaldum ) express certain specific properties of both Type I and Type II methanotrophs (Sahoo et al., 2021). For utilizing C1-carbon sources, Type I and Type X methanotrophs  use  RuMP  pathway,  while  Type  II  methanotrophs  use  serine pathway (Sahoo et al., 2021). Type X methanotrophs vary from Type I owing to minimal expression of ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase (an enzyme of serine cycle), occurring in Calvin-Benson-Bassham pathway (Park and Kim, 2019).\n\nThere have been initiatives on methanol production via MMO (soluble and particulate) catalysed biological oxidation of methane (Mardina et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2016a, 2020a). However, MDH and other enzymes cause subsequent sequential oxidation of the produced methanol  into  intermediate  metabolites  and  CO2,  resulting  in  decreased extracellular methanol accumulation (Sheets et al., 2016). To that end, various  MDH  inhibitors  ( e.g. ,  NaCl,  NH4Cl,  phosphate,  EDTA,  and MgCl2) are supplemented in the fermentation media to increase methanol  production  (Patel  et  al.,  2016a;  Sheets  et  al.,  2016).  Although, particulate MMOs are also involved in the methanol production metabolism, but they do not require any cofactors for their activity. On the other hand, soluble MMOs require natural co-factor (NADH) regeneration for their activity and increased methanol accumulation. However, the MDH inhibitor-induced inhibition of methanol oxidation result in NADH depletion (Sahoo et al., 2021).

{"chunk": "[Section: 1. Introduction — Part 3]\n(Sheets et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2020c). Even with all these initiatives, a lower methanol titer in the range of 0.16 -0.4 g L GLYPH<0> 1 (Hwang et al., 2015; Patel et al., 2016a; Mardina et al., 2016) has been achieved under native conditions  in  batch  mode.  Moreover,  methanol  production  through biological oxidation of methane is constrained by high cost of pure CH4 as  feed,  low  methanol  titer  associated  with  low  solubility  of  CH4 in liquid  medium,  low  CH4 utilization  efficiency  and  consequent  slow growth rate of methanotrophs, and so on. Authors have tried to overcome these limitations through the use of biogas as low-cost feedstock (Sheets et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2020b), immobilization of cells/biocatalyst (Patel et al., 2020a, 2020b), repeated-batch cultures for reusability  of  cells  (Patel  et  al.,  2020b,  2020c),  co-culture  of  cells  for improved  biocatalytic  activity  (Patel  et  al.,  2020a)  and,  addition  of methane vector to improve solubility (Patel et al., 2020c). An alternative to  the  current  approaches  could  be  the  utilization  of  CO2,  the end-product in the methanotrophic metabolism, as feedstock for methanol production. CO2, when fed to the cells in excess concentration, shifts the equilibrium in the backward direction (Xin et al., 2007). Since the activity of MMO is irreversible, the process results in the accumulation of methanol as an extracellular end-product (Xin et al., 2007).\n\nMicrobial metabolism, a biological process, involves high degree of complexity and exhibits significant variability with changes in growth conditions and environmental perturbation. To that end, a mechanistic model  in  synergy  with  experimental  observations,  can  serve  as  an effective  tool  towards  understanding  the  metabolism  of  a  biological system.  Various  kinetic  models  have  been  proposed  to  understand phenotypic  response  of  different  biological  systems  involving  methanotrophs e.g., metabolic  coupling  between  oxygenic  photosynthesis and  methane  oxidation  during  co-cultivation  of  photoautotroph  and methanotroph  (Badr  et  al.,  2019);  effect  of  nitrogen  and  oxygen  on production  of  polyhydroxybutyrate  (PHB)  using Methylocystis  parvus OBBP and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (Rostkowski et al., 2013); methane  oxidation  by  the  methanotrophic  bacterial  community  in paddy soil (Cai and Yan, 1999); and degradation of chlorinated organic compounds by mixed methanotrophic culture (Chang and Alvarez-Cohen, 1997). However, till date no model has been reported to describe growth of the methanotroph using methane and exploitation of methanotrophic  biomass  as  biocatalyst  for  conversion  of  CO2 to methanol.\n\nIn  the  present  study,  we  report  a  sequential  two-stage  integrated process  for  bio-methanol  production  using Methylosinus  trichosporium NCIMB 11131, coupled with sequestration of methane and carbon dioxide.  While,  the  first  stage  of  the  process  involves  generation  of methanotrophic biomass via sequestration of methane as the sole carbon source; the second stage deals with the application of this biomass as biocatalyst for the reduction of CO2  into methanol. High biomass titer and improved methane sequestration were achieved via optimization of process parameters e.g. , methane percentage in the inlet gas stream and flow rate of the gas mixture in a semi-batch stirred tank reactor. To achieve an improved methanol titer, optimization of CO2 concentration in the headspace and liquid to headspace volume ratio was carried out in an air tight batch reactor. Finally, a kinetic model was developed, which can be an effective tool to understand various phenotypic responses of the organism in terms of growth, methane sequestration, and methanol formation under the influence of varying process parameters. As another key outcome, the model was able to predict the dynamic profile for concentration  of  dissolved  CH4,  concentration  of  dissolved  CO2,  and headspace concentration of CO2.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/27", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 306.593, "t": 738.2119997695312, "r": 560.027, "b": 532.1419997695313, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/28", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 306.596, "t": 529.0219997695312, "r": 560.012, "b": 333.3759997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/29", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 306.596, "t": 330.2559997695312, "r": 560.015, "b": 134.66699976953123, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "1.

To that end, the organism was characterized for growth under different headspace gas compositions by varying the methane concentration from 5% to 80% v/ v in an air-tight reactor operated under batch mode.

Further, the biomass productivity in the semibatch mode was estimated to be in the range of 0.49 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 -0.63 g  L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 (Fig.  3b).  The  methane  fixation  rate  was  estimated  to  be comparable for growth at 2.5% (0.32 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 ) and 5% (0.34 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 ) methane concentration, respectively, albeit a marginally lower value was estimated for 1% methane concentration (0.27 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 ) (Fig. 3b). Even  though,  the  results  indicate  similar  growth  performance  and methane fixation rate at 2.5% and 5% methane concentration in the inlet  gas  stream,  the  latter  resulted  in  higher  amount  of  unutilized methane  being  released  into  the  atmosphere.  Hence,  subsequent  experiments under different inlet gas flow rates were carried out with a methane concentration of 2.5%. While, at inlet gas flow rate of 0.25 vvm, biomass titer (2.97 g L GLYPH<0> 1 ) and productivity (0.52 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 ) was compromised marginally, these parameters remained comparable for both  0.5  vvm  and  0.75  vvm  (Fig.  3c  and  d).  A  similar  profile  was observed for methane fixation rate with values of 0.28 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 , 0.32 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 , and 0.32 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 at inlet gas flow rates of 0.25, 0.5, and 0.75 vvm, respectively (Fig. 3d). The semi-batch stirred tank reactor with continuous  gas  sparging  resulted  in  significant  improvement  in  both biomass  titer  (~250%)  and  productivity  (~120%)  compared  to  the batch reactor. The semi-batch stirred tank reactor used in the present study enabled continuous supply of gas mixture using a sparger, located above the magnetic stirrer bar, resulting in uniform distribution of the gas  bubbles.  Constant  mixing  was  achieved  using  magnetic  stirrer, facilitating bottom-driven mass transfer. These attributes of the reactor prevented cell-settling and  dead-zone  formation  thereby offering improved growth kinetics. The mass transfer of methane is the limiting step in the optimal performance of methanotrophic systems due to the low solubility of methane in aqueous solutions. Pauss et al. (1990) reported a three-fold increment in volumetric mass transfer coefficient (kLa) value for CH4  in a completely stirred tank reactor (0.09 h GLYPH<0> 1 ) as compared to sludge bed reactor operated without mechanical stirring (0.03 h GLYPH<0> 1 ). Therefore, in the present study, inlet methane concentration of 2.5% with a gas flow rate of 0.5 vvm was chosen for the generation of methanotrophic biomass in semi-batch stirred tank reactor resulting in biomass titer of 3.39 g L GLYPH<0> 1 and productivity 0.60 g L GLYPH<0> 1  d GLYPH<0> 1 .", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/214", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox":

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.2.1. Evaluation of M. trichosporium as a potential biocatalyst for methanol biosynthesis under different process conditions]\nThe highest methanol titer of 0.56 g L GLYPH<0> 1 was recorded when the biomass was harvested from the first stage of growth and subsequently resuspended in phosphate buffer medium (Fig. 4a). However, methanol titer was found to reduce significantly (0.15 -0.18 g L GLYPH<0> 1 ) when either freshly  prepared  NMS  medium  or  same  NMS  medium  (used  for  the growth) was employed for methanol synthesis. Phosphate buffer also resulted  in  improved  methanol  productivity  (0.026  g  L GLYPH<0> 1 h GLYPH<0> 1 )  as compared to the other two process conditions (0.01 -0.013 g L GLYPH<0> 1  h GLYPH<0> 1 ) (Fig.  4a).  One  of  the  key  problems  with  methanol  production  from methane is the subsequent conversion of methanol into formaldehyde, catalysed by the enzyme methanol dehydrogenase (Sahoo et al., 2021). Several authors have reported the role of phosphate as an inhibitor for the enzyme methanol dehydrogenase, either by adding a specific concentration of phosphate to the NMS media (Han et al., 2013; Sheets et al., 2016) or by directly using phosphate buffer as a medium (Mardina et  al.,  2016; Patel  et al.,  2016a, 2020c) for methanol production via methane oxidation. Although in our study, methanol is being produced through the CO2  reduction pathway, there may be a possibility of the back-conversion of methanol into intermediate metabolites and CO2, owing to the reversible nature of the enzymes methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and formate dehydrogenase. This is where the  role  of  phosphate  buffer  as  a  cultivation  medium  for  methanol production from CO2 comes into play, resulting in higher methanol titer and productivity relative to the NMS media. It is important to note that in  none  of  the  media,  further  growth  of  the  organism  was  observed during methanol synthesis stage or phase (data not shown). In general, methanotrophic cells stay in the resting phase while being used as biocatalyst for methanol production from CO2 (Xin et al., 2007) and hence do not require other media components to sustain their growth. Intracellularly stored NADH supply the reducing energy to accomplish the reduction of CO2 to methanol.

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.2.2. Methanol production under varying CO2 concentrations and liquid to headspace volume ratios]\nIn the first step, methanol production was attempted in a semi-batch stirred tank reactor by continuous sparging of CO2  (2.5% v/v) mixed with air at a flow rate of 0.5 vvm under atmospheric pressure. However, no methanol was detected in the extracellular medium. It has been reported that, at high partial pressure, the solubility of gases increases resulting  in  better  interaction  of  the  gaseous  substrate  with  the  key enzymes and in turn, positively regulates growth or product formation metabolism (Hurst and Lewis, 2010). Hence, in the present study, failure to induce methanol production in semi-batch stirred tank reactor may be attributed to the lower partial pressure of CO2 in the gas mixture, which is  considered  to  be  the  critical  parameter  for  methanol  production. Therefore, the second stage of methanol production was carried out in air-tight  batch  reactor  with  CO2 mixed  with  air  supplied  in  the headspace.\n\nThe extent of methanol formation was carried out under varying CO2 concentrations  in  the  headspace  ranging  from  10%  to  70%  v/v.  No methanol was produced at the lowest CO2  concentration of 10%. The methanol titer was found to increase concomitantly with the increase in CO2 concentration from 30% and reached a maximum value of 0.57 g L GLYPH<0> 1 (17.79 mM) at a CO2 concentration of 50% (Fig. 4b). The CO2 fixation percentage at 50% CO2 concentration was estimated to be 8.95% of the initial amount of CO2 present in the headspace. However, further increase  in  CO2 concentration  beyond  50%  resulted  in  a  marginal decrease in methanol titer. These results point towards the role of CO2 partial pressure in the headspace as a critical parameter for methanol induction. However, down regulation of methanol biosynthesis at higher CO2 partial pressure may be attributed to the possible inhibitory effect on enzymatic activity, electron transport chain, and carbon metabolism (Ceron-Chafla et al., 2020). There are a handful of studies towards the biological production of methanol via CO2 reduction pathway. Methylosinus sporium was reported to produce methanol with a very low titer of 0.33 mM when grown in the presence of 30% CO2 (Patel et al., 2016b). Xin et al. (2007) reported production of 0.004 μ mol methanol per mg dry cell weight from Methylosinus trichosporium cells, using 55.5% CO2 in the headspace. With the increase in liquid to headspace volume ratio from 50:50, methanol titer increased linearly and a maximum titer of 0.58 g L GLYPH<0> 1 (18.10 mM) was obtained at a ratio of 10:90 (Fig. 4c). The corresponding CO2 fixation percentage was estimated to be 9.06%. The results  suggest  that  headspace  volume  is  another  process  parameter influencing methanol production since it is directly linked to the availability of CO2, as the substrate for reduction reaction, at a fixed partial pressure. Thus, the occurrence of the highest methanol titer at liquid to headspace volume ratio of 10:90 could be attributed to the absence of substrate limitation (Pen et al., 2014). Characterization of M. sporium towards  methanol  biosynthesis  through  methane  oxidation  under different  headspace  volumes  resulted  in  highest  titer  of  5.40  mM  at headspace volume of 83.33% (Patel et al., 2016a). Pen et al. (2014) reported  an  improved  methanol  titer  of  290  mg  L GLYPH<0> 1 from  methane biohydroxylation  using M.  trichosporium in  batch  reactor  with  90% headspace volume as compared to cultivation with 37.5% headspace volume (35 mg L GLYPH<0> 1 ).  The  biomass  density  remained almost constant during methanol production stage under varying CO2 concentrations in the headspace and different liquid to headspace volume ratios (Fig. S1a, b; Supplementary material).\n\nAs  discussed  earlier,  authors  have  reported  several  strategies  to overcome  the  limitations  associated  with  methanol  production  from biological oxidation of CH4, including, use of biogas as feedstock, cell\n\nModel parameters for two-stage integrated process towards production of bioof methane and carbon dioxide.\n\nimmobilization, repeated-batch cultivation, co-culture of cells, supplementation of methane vector, etc . (Sheets et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2020a, b, c). Despite of these approaches, the reported methanol titre is limited to the range of 5.37 -13.42 mM (or, 0.17 -0.43 g L GLYPH<0> 1 ). Further, methanol production from biological reduction of CO2, is also limited to a low methanol titer of up to 0.33 mM (Xin et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2016b). Therefore, it can be concluded that the maximum methanol titer achieved in the present study under optimum conditions is significantly higher than the similar studies reported in literature.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/360", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 37.588, "t": 644.0509997695312, "r": 291.016, "b": 500.7899997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/361", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 37.587, "t": 497.6129997695312, "r": 291.033, "b": 82.33999976953123, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/362", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 37.59, "t": 79.16299976953121, "r": 291.03, "b": 50.93099976953124, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/364", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 306.595, "t": 727.8179997695312, "r": 559.78, "b": 702.1329997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/365", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 8, "bbox": {"l": 306.593, "t": 530.2059997695312, "r": 560.018, "b": 439.2229997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "3.2.2.

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.3.1. Kinetic modelling for the first stage]\nIn the present study, batch data with inlet gas mixture composition of 2.5% CH4 at 0.5 vvm flow-rate was used for the estimation of the model parameters (Fig. 5a). The model was subsequently validated with the experimental  data  from  two  batch  runs  with  the  inlet  gas  mixture composition of 1% (Fig. 5b) and 5% CH4 (Fig. 5c) at a flow rate of 0.5 vvm.\n\nEstimation  of  parameters  in  reaction  kinetic  expressions  is  an essential step during the development of a process model. In the present study,  while  the  biomass  yield  coefficient  (Yx/s),  maximum  specific growth  rate  ( μ max),  and  maximum  biomass  concentration  (xm)  were derived from experimental data of various batch runs, the other kinetic parameters,  such  as  half-saturation  constant  (Ks),  volumetric  mass transfer coefficient for methane ( kLaCH 4 ) and model constants such as, n and A were determined by parameter estimation (Table 1). The values of universal  gas  constant  (R = 0.0821  L-atm  mol GLYPH<0> 1  K GLYPH<0> 1 )  and  Henry ' s constant for methane ( HCH 4 = 0.0015 mol L GLYPH<0> 1  atm GLYPH<0> 1 ) were obtained from literature (Meylan and Howard, 1991; Lovley et al., 1994). In a fermentation process, when substrate concentration is higher than Ks, the specific growth rate of the bacteria is also higher, often approaching the maximum specific growth rate. When substrate concentration becomes equal to or less than Ks, the specific growth rate of the bacteria reduces, implying that there is an inherent substrate limitation in the system (Grady et al., 2011). According to the parameters estimated for the present model, the value of Ks  (0.07 g L GLYPH<0> 1 ) was found to be lower than  the  dissolved  CH4 concentration  of  approximately  0.35  g  L GLYPH<0> 1 (Fig. 5a) at any given point of time. This implies that there was negligible  substrate  limitation  in  the  semi-batch  system  employed  for  the purpose of this study. Kov ´ arov ´ a-Kovar and Egli (1998) interpreted 1/Ks as the affinity of a cell towards the substrate, where a lower Ks  value corresponds to a higher substrate affinity. A low Ks value can also imply a higher conversion of substrate into biomass. This implication is in line with the affinity concept that associates low Ks  value to larger harvest volumes (Ugalde-Salas et al., 2020).

This value is in a feasible range, as inferred from the studies of Pauss et al. (1990) who previously reported a kLa value for methane of 0.09 h GLYPH<0> 1 in a completely stirred tank reactor at steady state.\n\nThe model was able to predict the growth profiles of the organism at methane concentrations of 1% (Fig. 5b) and 5% (Fig. 5c) in the gas mixture  accurately.  Further,  the  model  provided  an  insight  into  the dissolved methane concentration profile (Fig. 5) as one of the key outputs, thereby offering an easy alternate solution to energy intensive and expensive experimental methods (Aldhafeeri et al., 2020). As the gas was  continuously  sparged  throughout  the  batch  run,  the  overall methane  concentration  initially  increased  and  reached  a  saturation value, beyond which it was approximately constant (Fig. 5). A decrease in the concentration of dissolved methane was observed from 21 h to\n\n100 h, implying a higher substrate uptake rate due to the exponential growth phase of the bacteria.", "provenance":

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.3.2. Kinetic modelling for the second stage]\nFor the second stage of the model, batch data with 50% CO2 (Fig. 6a) in the headspace was used for the estimation of model parameters. The model was subsequently validated with the experimental data from two batch runs with headspace CO2 concentration of 30% (Fig. 6b) and 70% (Fig.  6c).  While  specific  product  formation  rate  (Qpmax)  was  derived from experimental data, the kinetic and stoichiometric parameters such as product yield coefficient (Yp/s) and volumetric mass transfer coefficient for carbon dioxide ( kLaCO 2 ) were estimated (Table 1). The value of Henry ' s constant for carbon dioxide (HCO2 = 0.033 mol L GLYPH<0> 1  atm GLYPH<0> 1 ) was obtained from literature (Sander et al., 2011). With the change in CO2\n\n9\n\n9\n\n(a)\n\n1.4\n\n1.0\n\nGLYPH<0>0GLYPH<0>DGLYPH<0>Q\n\nconcentration,  Qpmax was  found  to  vary  within  a  narrow  range  of 0.008 -0.02  h GLYPH<0> 1 .  However,  the  product  yield  coefficient  (Yp/s,  g  of methanol per g of CO2 consumed) was found to vary significantly within the range of 0.43 -0.68. The value of kLaCO 2 was estimated to be 0.11 h GLYPH<0> 1, comparable with that of methane.\n\nIn the second stage, the model predicted profiles of methanol formation was found to be in good agreement with the experimental data for  both  30%  (Fig.  6b)  and  70%  CO2  (Fig.  6c)  concentration  in  the headspace. An initial lag phase of approximately 3 h in methanol production was observed in all the three batch experiments. This lag phase may be attributed to the delayed induction in the mass transfer of CO2 from headspace to the liquid phase (Fig. 6). Beyond the initial lag phase of 3 h, a gradual decrease in headspace CO2 concentration was predicted till the end of the batch (Fig. 6). Post lag phase, an initial increase in dissolved  CO2  concentration  was  found  to  be  concomitant  with  the decrease  in  headspace  CO2 concentration,  after  which  the  bacteria actively utilized it to produce methanol, leading to a significant decrease in dissolved CO2 concentration beyond 5 h. The dissolved CO2 concentration eventually became zero, at which point the methanol production was also seen to be saturated.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/469", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 306.596, "t": 156.60499976953122, "r": 560.011, "b": 54.31299976953119, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/470", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 124.6721311288954, "t": 646.7649423391425, "r": 129.83606551864557, "b": 640.1195934723619, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/471", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 124.67213113504295, "t": 484.32308186295063, "r": 129.8360655247931, "b": 477.67773299617005, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/472", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 147.54098346314012, "t": 771.5498258928521, "r": 163.03278695028206, "b": 761.212616827097, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/473", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 317.2131146002584, "t": 781.8870353952545, "r": 329.7540984361145, "b": 773.764942194571, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/474", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 317.2131147589038, "t": 746.4451749733654, "r": 329.016393364047, "b": 737.5847096057304, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/475", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 571.665, "t": 756.6919997695312, "r": 594.172, "b": 751.3529997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/478", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 37.587, "t": 738.2169997695312, "r": 291.032, "b": 689.0099997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/479", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 37.587, "t": 685.8899997695312, "r": 291.039, "b": 532.0849997695312, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "3.3.2.
