{"chunk": "[Section: Abstract]\nBackground Methane   (CH 4 ), as one of the major energy sources, easily escapes from the supply chain into the atmosphere, because it exists in a gaseous state under ambient conditions. Compared to carbon dioxide   (CO 2 ),   CH 4 is 25 times more potent at trapping radiation; thus, the emission of   CH 4 to the atmosphere causes severe global warming and climate change. To mitigate   CH 4 emissions and utilize them effectively, the direct biological conversion of   CH 4 into liquid fuels, such as methanol   (CH 3 OH), using methanotrophs is a promising strategy. However, supplying biocatalysts in an aqueous medium with   CH 4 involves high energy consumption due to vigorous agitation and/ or bubbling, which is a serious concern in methanotrophic processes, because the aqueous phase causes a very large barrier to the delivery of slightly soluble gases.\n\nResults An inverse membrane bioreactor (IMBR), which combines the advantages of gas-phase bioreactors and membrane bioreactors, was designed and constructed for the bioconversion of   CH 4 into   CH 3 OH in this study. In contrast to the conventional membrane bioreactor with bacterial cells that are immersed in an aqueous phase, the filtered cells were placed to face a gas phase in the IMBR to supply   CH 4 directly from the gas phase to bacterial cells. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative methanotroph, was used to demonstrate the bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH 3 OH in the IMBR. Cyclopropanol was supplied from the aqueous phase as a selective inhibitor of methanol dehydrogenase, preventing further   CH 3 OH oxidation. Sodium formate was added as an electron donor to generate NADH, which is necessary for   CH 3 OH production. After optimizing the inlet concentration of   CH 4 , the mass of cells, the cyclopropanol concentration, and the gas flow rate, continuous   CH 3 OH production can be achieved over 72 h with productivity at 0.88 mmol   L -1 h -1 in the IMBR, achieving a longer operation period and higher productivity than those using other types of membrane bioreactors reported in the literature.\n\nConclusions The IMBR can facilitate the development of gas-to-liquid (GTL) technologies via microbial processes, allowing highly efficient mass transfer of substrates from the gas phase to microbial cells in the gas phase and having the supplement of soluble chemicals convenient.\n\nKeywords Gas-phase bioreaction, Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), Methane, Methanol production, Membrane bioreactor\n\n*Correspondence: Katsutoshi Hori khori@chembio.nagoya-u.ac.jp\n\nDepartment of Biotechnology, Graduate School of Engineering, Nagoya University, Furo-Cho, Chikusa-Ku, Nagoya 464-8603, Japan\n\n© The Author(s) 2023.

{"chunk": "[Section: Background — Part 1]\nMethane    (CH 4 ),  the  main  component  of  biogas,  shale gas, and gas hydrate, has been used as the major energy resource for humans. After the shale gas revolution in the United States,   CH 4 became a popular chemical feedstock due to its high availability. However, because   CH 4 exists in a gaseous state in ambient conditions, large amounts of    CH 4 dissipation  occur  through  the  entire  gas  supply chain,  resulting  in  severe  greenhouse  effects  [1].  Of  the various  candidate  technologies  for  effectively  utilizing CH4, liquefied  natural  gas  (LNG)  is  a  common  form  to transport    CH 4 from  its  production  site  to  distant  consumption sites. However, the cost is quite expensive due to the extremely low temperature needed for storage and transportation. Converting   CH 4 into methanol   (CH3OH) through  a  gas-to-liquid  (GTL)  technique  has  attracted much attention because of the ease of storage and transportation  of  liquid    CH 3 OH  [2,  3].    CH 3 OH  is  a  useful feedstock for further chemical synthesis, a fuel with high energy  density,  and  an  excellent  hydrogen  carrier  that provides  safe  and  clean  energy.  However,  the  chemical process of producing   CH 3 OH through direct functionalization of   CH 4 is  energy intensive (the reaction temperature is approximately 900 °C and the operation pressure is 0.5-4 MPa) due to the high energy to cleave the C-H bond of   CH 4 (104 kcal   mol -1 ) [4].\n\nThe use of methanotrophs, which are methane-oxidizing microorganisms, as whole-cell catalysts has attracted great attention, because methanotrophs can biologically convert    CH 4 to    CH3OH by their  methane  monooxygenase (MMO) under ambient conditions in a single step [5-7].  Although    CH 4 bioconversion  shows  great  potential as an economical GTL technology, it still faces some difficulties in achieving efficient conversion for commercialization. One of the difficulties occurs due to the low solubility of   CH 4 and oxygen   (O 2 ) in water. Since the conventional methanotrophic process is generally conducted in the aqueous phase [8-13], the limitation of the amount of dissolved   CH 4 results in a low productivity of   CH3OH. Although various configurations of bioreactors for methanotrophic reactions have been proposed to enhance the process of dissolving   CH 4 in the aqueous phase, such as stirred tank reactors and bubble-lift reactors [14-16], the process consumes high amounts of energy to deliver gaseous substrates to the cells by stirring or bubbling.\n\nGas-phase  bioreactions  have  been  proposed  to  attain highly  efficient  delivery  of  gaseous  substrates  from  the gas phase to whole-cell catalysts without stirring or bubbling [17, 18]. In gas-phase bioreactors, it is necessary to immobilize  microbial  cells  on  solid  supports  instead  of dispersing them in an aqueous phase. A very large barrier of mass transfer of gaseous substrates from the gas phase to  the  aqueous  phase  is  largely  reduced  or  disappears in  the  absence  of  the  bulk  liquid.  In  the  case  of  methanotrophs,  cells  immobilized  on  polypropylene  rings  or porous building materials have been used for   CH 4 degradation  in  the  gas  phase  [19-21].  Some  studies  have claimed  that  microbial  cells  encapsulated  in  hydrogels can be used for gas-phase bioreactions, such as trichloroethylene degradation by Methylocystis sp. M (strain M) encapsulated in hydrogel beads [22]. However, we believe that  systems  using  gels  that  contain  a  high  content  of water  to  encapsulate  cells  should  not  be  recognized  as gas-phase reactions. In fact, our previous study showed that the degradation rate of   CH 4 by Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) cells encapsulated in alginate gel was as slow as that in a static aqueous phase [23].\n\nIn  contrast  to  the  degradation  of  gaseous  substrates, there  are  very  few  reports  on  GTL  bioproduction  in the gas phase; the research is limited to the production of  highly  volatile  chemicals,  which  are  easily  harvested from the gas phase. For example, Hou produced propylene oxide from propylene using Methylosinus sp. CRL 31 immobilized on porous glass beads in a gas -solid bioreactor [24]. In the case of   CH 3 OH, which has a hydrophilic liquid form at normal pressure and ordinary temperature in most bioreactions, it is difficult to harvest the gaseous product unless vaporization is enhanced by heating and/ or  decompression.  In  addition,  an  inhibitor  for  methanol  dehydrogenase (MDH) and an electron donor, such as sodium formate, are usually needed for   CH3OH production by wild-type methanotrophs [9, 25, 26], but supplying these chemicals in gas-phase bioreactors is quite difficult.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/18", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 56.693, "t":

{"chunk": "[Section: Background — Part 2]\nMembrane bioreactors (MBRs), which combine bioprocesses with membrane  filtration, are popular wastewater treatment systems, because they realize simultaneous biological reactions and solid -liquid separations.  Recently,  membrane  aerated  reactors,  in  which membranes are used for air supply rather than for solid -liquid  separation,  have  attracted  attention  [27,  28].  In these  types  of  MBRs,    O 2 and/or  gaseous  substrates  are supplied  from  the  gas  phase,  transported  through  the membrane, and delivered to microbial cells in the aqueous  phase.  The  microbial  cells  are  suspended  in  the aqueous  phase  or  immobilized  on  the  membrane  as  a biofilm  and  catalyze  the  oxidation  of  organic  chemicals in the aqueous phase. These MBRs have been employed for  aerobic  wastewater  treatment  [29,  30],  synthesis  of fine  chemicals  [31,  32],  and    CH 3 OH  production  [33, 34],  in  which    CH 4 and    O 2 were  supplied  through  two independent  membrane  modules;  premixing  was  not performed  to  keep  the  risk  of  explosion  low.  However, the  disadvantage  of  membrane  aerated  reactors  is  the requirement  of  gas  pressurizing  to  assist  gas  diffusion through the membrane into the aqueous phase, which is\n\nenergy-consuming.  Because  of  the  development  of  biofilms on the membrane on the side of the aqueous phase, the transmembrane pressure must be increased over time to maintain the gas permeability.\n\nThe purpose of this study was to develop a new energyefficient  gas-phase  bioreactor  for  bioconversion  from CH4 gas into liquid   CH 3 OH. A novel idea for a new bioreactor is to place filtered methanotroph cells on a membrane filter in the gas phase, which is a combination of a gas-phase bioreactor and an MBR.

{"chunk": "[Section: Bioconversion of methane to methanol in an inverse membrane bioreactor]\nTo  simultaneously  deliver  gaseous    CH 4 to  the  methanotrophic cells, supply cyclopropanol and formate from the aqueous phase, and harvest   CH3OH from the aqueous  phase,  we  developed  a  novel  MBR,  IMBR,  which had the  same  reactor  configuration  as  described  above; however, the  membrane sheet was placed in an inverse direction  to  that  of  the  conventional  MBRs,  so  that  the filtered cells were faced the gas phase (Fig. 3a). M. capsulatus (Bath) cells were filtered on a sheet of hydrophilic glass fiber filter, which was employed to efficiently transport water and soluble chemicals through the membrane and was set, so that the cells were not immersed in the aqueous  solution  in  the  liquid  chamber.  Thus,  gaseous CH4 and   O 2 were directly delivered to the filtered wholecell catalysts in the gas phase, and the produced   CH3OH was transported to the aqueous phase via the hydrophilic membrane. In contrast, chemicals in the aqueous phase, including cyclopropanol, sodium formate, and inorganic nutrients,  were  delivered  to  the  filtered  cells  from  the aqueous phase via the membrane. A peristaltic pump was used for liquid circulation and to harvest   CH3OH from the  solution  container.  The  water  level  in  the  solution container remained lower than the position of the membrane sheet in the IMBR, generating negative pressure in the  direction  from  the  filtered  cells  to  the  liquid  chamber. Thus, the cake of the filtered cells was maintained in a semidry condition on the hydrophilic membrane in the gas phase.\n\nUsing this new IMBR, bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH3OH was  performed.  All  the  operation  parameters  were  the same as those in the conventional MBR except the direction of the filtered cells and the material of the membrane filter.  The  time  courses of the   CH 4 concentration of the exhausted  gas  at  the  outlet  and  the  concentration  of CH3OH accumulated in the solution container are shown in Fig. 3b. After infusing   CH 4 into the IMBR, the concentration  of    CH 4 decreased  from  20%  ( v / v )  at  the  inlet  to 19.6% ( v / v )  at  the  outlet.    CH3OH was rapidly produced and  accumulated  in  the  aqueous  phase;  the  concentration of accumulated   CH3OH reached 2.0 mM in 2 h and then  gradually  increased  to  3.7  mM  in  6  h,  which  was approximately  4  times  higher  than  that  with  the  conventional  MBR.  The  overall    CH 3 OH  productivity  was 0.62 mmol   L -1 h -1 in  the  IMBR with a batch operation of the aqueous phase. The formate concentration, which supplies  reducing  power  for    CH 4 oxidation,  decreased from 10 to 3.8 mM in 6 h (Additional file 1). The value of pH increased from 7.0 to 8.3, likely due to the consumption of proton produced by formate conversion into   CO 2 during   CH3OH production.

During the 6 h operation, the average consumption rate of   CH 4 was 25.3 μmol   h -1 ,  which was significantly enhanced in the IMBR compared with the  conventional  MBR  operated  as  a  negative  control (Fig.  2),  while  the  overall  conversion of   CH 4 to    CH3OH was 24.4% and 23.5% in the IMBR and the conventional MBR,  respectively.  This  indicates  that  even  though  the cell  activities  in  these  two  systems  are  almost  identical, resistance to the mass transfer of   CH 4 limits the rate of CH4  consumption  and  dominates  the  rate  of    CH3OH production. Thus, the gas-phase bioreaction in the IMBR increased  the  rate  of    CH 4 consumption  compared  with that  of  the  aqueous-phase  bioreaction  and  caused  an increase in the rate of   CH3OH production.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/32", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 304.721, "t": 677.8419951171875, "r": 540.914, "b": 343.7699951171875,

{"chunk": "[Section: Effects of the operating conditions of the IMBR on the consumption and conversion of methane — Part 1]\nIn the aforementioned result (Fig. 3b), the consumption ratio of   CH 4 , which directly demonstrates the efficiency of the substrate utilization, was very low (only 2%).

In  a  well-mixed condition  in  a  bioreactor,  in  which  reactants  and  biocatalysts efficiently collide by agitation or bubbling for the liquid phase (such as an activated sludge process), the space time is close to the actual residence time of reactants, and therefore, a longer space time results in a higher conversion or consumption ratio. In our IMBR, although the gas phase was not agitated, the diffusion rate of gaseous reactants with a small molecular mass, such  as    CH 4, was  quick  enough  in  the  gas  phase  that gaseous reactants were expected to contact the filtered cells  efficiently.  Therefore,  the  increase  in  the  space time might improve the ratio of methane consumption. To confirm this, a new reactor with a gas chamber volume of 25 mL (Fig. 4a, b) was fabricated. In this reactor,  the  outlet  was  also  repositioned  on  the  opposite side of the inlet, as far away from the inlet as possible,\n\n(a)\n\nInlet gas\n\n~10 mm ,\n\n~10 mm*\n\nSampling port\n\nOutlet gas\n\nGas flow\n\nLiquid flow\n\n25 mL Gas chamber\n\n~10 mm\n\n~10 mm\n\n40 mm\n\n(a)\n\nInlet gas\n\nOutlet gas\n\nSampling port\n\n(b)\n\n(c)\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n3\n\nCH4 concentration (% (v/v))\n\nTime (h)\n\n25 mL\n\n2.5 mL\n\nto  prevent the gas from passing through without contacting the filtered cells. This IMBR with the large gas chamber  was  compared  with  the  previously  mentioned  IMBR  with  the  smaller  gas  chamber  in  terms of  the  consumption ratio of   CH 4 .  The  glass  fiber  filter with 10 mg-DCW of filtered M. capsulatus (Bath) cells was set between the gas and liquid chambers of these IMBRs,  and  the  aqueous  solution  in  the  absence  of cyclopropanol and sodium formate was infused into the liquid chamber and circulated at 10 mL   min -1 . The volumetric flow rate of the inlet gas containing 20% ( v / v ) CH4 was fixed at 1 mL   min -1 .\n\nAs shown in Fig. 4c, in the IMBR with the larger gas chamber, the   CH 4 concentration at the outlet decreased to 19.0% ( v/v ) during the first 1.5 h and remained constant afterward. When the IMBR with the smaller gas chamber was  used,  the  exhausted    CH 4 concentration  decreased sharply over time, reaching 17.6% ( v/v ) after 1 h, and then became constant at approximately 17.5% ( v/v ). In the gas chambers  of  2.5  mL  and  25  mL,  the  space  time  of  the inlet gas was 2.5 min and 25 min, respectively. Although the space time in the gas chamber of 25 mL was 10 times longer than that in the gas chamber of 2.5 mL, the consumption  ratio  of    CH 4 was  much  lower  (approximately\n\n1/25) in the larger gas chamber than that in the smaller one (Additional file 3). Therefore, other operating conditions  had  to  be  examined  to  improve  the  consumption ratio of   CH 4,  and the IMBR with a 2.5 mL gas chamber was used in further experiments.", "provenance":

{"chunk": "[Section: Effects of the operating conditions of the IMBR on the consumption and conversion of methane — Part 2]\nNext, we examined the effects of the   CH 4 concentration of  the  inlet  gas  on  the    CH 4 consumption  and    CH3OH production in the IMBR. For this purpose, M. capsulatus (Bath) cells of 12.5 mg-DCW on the membrane were faced  the  gas  phase  in  the  IMBR,  in  which  the  bottom liquid  chamber  carried  10  mL  of  the  aqueous  solution containing 10 μM cyclopropanol and 10 mM sodium formate, with circulation at 10 mL   min -1 . A gas containing CH4 at concentrations  from  2%  to  30%  ( v / v )  in  air  was continuously pumped into the gas chamber at a gas flow rate of 1 mL   min -1 . The consumption rate of   CH 4 and the production rate of   CH 3 OH were determined by the total amounts of   CH4 consumed and   CH3OH produced in the first 1 h of the reaction. Thereafter, from the ratio of these two values, the conversion of   CH 4 into   CH 3OH as a percentage was calculated. As a result, the   CH4 consumption rate increased from 3.1 to 17 μmol   h -1 , and the consumption ratio of   CH 4 increased from 0.7% to 3.7% when the CH4 concentration of the inlet gas increased from 2% to 20% ( v / v ), but both of the values remained constant when the   CH 4 concentration was higher than 20% ( v / v ) (Fig. 5a and  Additional  file  4a).  The    CH 3 OH  production  rate showed the same trend as the   CH 4 consumption rate; it increased from 1.1 to 10 μmol   h -1 on  2-20% ( v/v )    CH4 and remained constant at > 20% ( v/v )   CH 4 . This suggested that   CH3OH production was dominated by MMO activity when MDH activity was inhibited and excess NADH was  supplemented  by  the  addition  of  sodium  formate. The  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH 3OH  increased  from 37% to 60% when the   CH4 concentration in the inlet gas increases up to 20% ( v/v )  (Additional file 4a). Therefore, the optimal   CH 4 concentration was 20% ( v/v )  under the operating conditions of the IMBR.\n\nWe also examined the effect of the mass of filtered M. capsulatus (Bath)  cells  on  the    CH 4 consumption  and CH3OH production in the  IMBR.  For  this  purpose, M. capsulatus (Bath)  cells  from  6.25  to  100  mg-DCW  on the  membrane  were  faced  the  gas  phase  in  the  IMBR, which was run in the same manner as above except that the   CH 4 concentration in the inlet gas was fixed at 20% ( v / v ). The   CH 4 consumption rate and consumption ratio increased from 6.6 to 23 μmol   h -1 and from 1.4% to 4.9%, respectively, as the mass of filtered cells increased from 6.25 to 50 mg-DCW (Fig. 5b and Additional file 4b). On the  other  hand,  the    CH 3 OH production  rate  increased from 3.8 μmol   h -1 at  6.25  mg-DCW to 10 μmol   h -1 at 12.5 mg-DCW but decreased to 7.0 μmol   h -1 at 25 mgDCW and to 6.1 μmol   h -1 at 50 mg-DCW.

Therefore, the mass of the cells is  the  optimum  at  12.5  mg-DCW  under  the  operating conditions for the IMBR.\n\nMoreover,  we  investigated  the  effect  of  the  concentration  of  cyclopropanol  in  the  aqueous  solution  on the    CH 4 consumption  and    CH 3 OH production  in  the IMBR. M. capsulatus (Bath) cells at 12.5 mg-DCW on the membrane were faced the gas phase in the IMBR.

{"chunk": "[Section: Effects of the operating conditions of the IMBR on the consumption and conversion of methane — Part 3]\nsame  concentration  of  sodium  formate  at  10  mM  but different  concentrations  of  cyclopropanol  at  0  μM, 1  μM and 10 μM. Figure 6a shows the concentrations of  exhausted    CH 4 and  accumulated    CH 3 OH  in  three periods  with  three  different  concentrations  of  cyclopropanol. In the first 3 h of operation,   CH3OH was not produced because of the absence of cyclopropanol, and the exhausted   CH 4 concentration remained at approximately  17.8%  ( v/v ).  During  the  period  with  1  μM cyclopropanol,  a  small  amount  of    CH3OH  was  produced.  However,  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH was  not  sustained  and  decreased  from  4.6%  to  1.6% (Additional  file  5).  The  exhausted    CH 4 concentration slightly increased to 18.0% ( v/v )  in  this  period. At 6 h, the  solution  was  exchanged  again,  and  the  concentration of cyclopropanol was increased to 10 μM. During this period, although the exhausted   CH 4 concentration increased to 19.3% ( v/v ),   CH 3 OH was significantly accumulated and reached over 2 mM. The conversion was initially  approximately  60%  at  7  h  and  then  decreased to 21% at 9 h. With the same conditions as above except for  the  aqueous  phase,  which  contained  20  μM  cyclopropanol, its effects on the concentrations of exhausted CH4 and accumulated   CH3OH are shown in Fig. 6b. A higher concentration of cyclopropanol was expected to greatly inhibit MDH activity to produce more   CH3OH. However, the maximum accumulated   CH3OH concentration  reached  only  1  mM  in  7  h,  and  the  exhausted CH4 kept about 19.4% ( v/v ),  while  the  maximum conversion decreased to approximately 20% by the increase in  the  cyclopropanol concentration (Additional file 6). Thus,  the  optimal  cyclopropanol  concentration  was 10  μM  under  the  operating  conditions  of  the  IMBR. However, at all the cyclopropanol concentrations tested,  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH decreased with  time,  suggesting  that  the  continuous  supply  of cyclopropanol is necessary to maintain the conversion.\n\n0\n\n0.5\n\n1\n\n1.5\n\n2\n\n2.5\n\n15\n\n16\n\n17\n\n18\n\n19\n\n20\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\nCH3OH concentration (mM)\n\nCH4 concentration (%

{"chunk": "[Section: Continuous bioconversion of methane into methanol in an IMBR]\n(c)\n\n15\n\nFinally,  we  carried  out  the  continuous  production  of CH3OH from   CH4  in  a  gas  phase  using  the  IMBR  in the  operating  conditions  that  were  optimized  above (Fig.  7a).  A  mixed  gas  containing  20%  ( v / v )    CH 4 and air was continuously supplied into a 2.5-mL gas chamber  of  the  IMBR,  in  which M.  capsulatus (Bath)  cells of  12.5  mg-DCW  on  the  glass  fiber  filter  were  faced the  gas  phase,  and  the  same  volume  of  supplied  gas was  exhausted  from  the  gas  chamber.  A  total  volume of  10  mL  of  the  medium  containing  10  μM  cyclopropanol and 10 mM sodium formate, as well as 9.9 mM nitrate  as  a  nitrogen  source,  was  circulated  through  a 2.5  mL  liquid  chamber  of  the  IMBR  at  10  mL    min -1 using  a  peristaltic  pump.  To  replenish  formate  and other  medium  components  that  were  consumed  and to supply active cyclopropanol, in this experiment, the fresh medium was continuously injected into the liquid chamber at 4 mL   h -1 of  the  flow  rate  using  a  syringe pump,  and  the  same  volumetric  flow  of  the  liquid  as\n\n(%\n\nentrati\n\n§16 -\n\n14 -\n\n512-\n\n10\n\nCia 7 a Cchematic of the continuins anoration for the hinconversion\n\n30\n\n- 20 %\n\nthat injected was discharged into a solution container. The space velocity for the fresh medium was 1.6   h -1 .\n\nFirst, the gas flow rate was  varied from  0.2 to 2.5  mL    min -1 to  investigate  its  effect  on  the  reaction. Figure  7b  shows  the  effect  of  the  gas  flow  rate  on  the CH4  consumption  rate  and  the  consumption  ratio  of CH4  in  the  initial  1  h  of  the  reaction.  The    CH 4 consumption  rate  in  the  IMBR  remained  constant  at approximately 23 μmol   h -1 when the gas flow rate was in  the  range  from  0.2  to  1  mL    min -1 ,  while  the  consumption  ratio  of    CH 4 decreased  from  24.2%  to  5.1% in  this  range.  On  the  other  hand,  the    CH4  consumption rate decreased from 23 to 8.6 μmol   h -1 when the gas flow rate increased from 1 to 2.5 mL   min -1 , and the consumption  ratio  of    CH 4 further  decreased  to  0.7%. This suggests that the space time of   CH 4 in the IMBR is too short to maintain the same   CH 4 consumption rate as that at 1 mL   min -1 when the gas flow rate is above 1.5 mL   min -1 . Then, we tried to run the IMBR by flowing the gas at 0.2 mL   min -1 in its gas chamber for more\n\nCH.OH in the IMPR h Efforts of the das flow rate on the\n\nSARAN\n\n(b)\n\n= Consumption rate\n\n… Consumption ratio\n\nthan 3 d for the continuous bioconversion of   CH 4 into CH3OH by a microbial gas-phase reaction.\n\nThe  time  courses  of    CH 4 concentration  in  a  gas exhausted from the gas chamber and   CH3OH concentration in a liquid discharged from the liquid chamber are  shown  in  Fig.  7c.  The    CH 4 concentration  in  the exhausted  gas  decreased  from  20.0%  to  15.3%  ( v / v ) in  the  first  4  h  of  the  reaction,  increased  slightly  to 16.9% ( v / v ) in the next 36 h, and thereafter remained at approximately 16.7% ( v / v ) in the steady state. The variation  in  the    CH 3 OH  concentration  of  the  discharged solution  showed  a  trend  in  response  to  that  of  the exhausted    CH 4 concentration,  although  the  response was  slightly  delayed.  The  produced    CH 3 OH  initially increased and reached 1.4 mM in 15 h. Then, it slowly decreased along with the drop in the consumption rate of    CH 4 and  then  remained  constant  at  1.0  mM  after 40 h to the end of the experiment. The   CH4  consumption ratio and   CH 3OH productivity over time are shown in  Fig.  7d.  Before  36  h,  the  consumption  ratio  of    CH 4 decreased from 23.4% to 17.6% but kept the ratio during  the  steady  state.    CH 3 OH  productivities  increased from 0.27 mmol   L -1 h -1 at  2  h  to  0.94  mmol    L -1 h -1 (the maximum) at 20 h, and kept over 0.8 mmol   L -1 h -1 (0.88 mmol   L -1 h -1 in average) during the steady state. The conversion at each timepoint, calculated from the ratio  of  the    CH 3 OH production  rate  to  the    CH 4 consumption rate, is summarized in Table 1. The maximum conversion was 37% at 15 h. The average conversion in the  steady  state  was  approximately  27%,  the  average value of those at 52 h, 64 h, and 76 h in Table 1.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/311", "label": "text",

{"chunk": "[Section: Discussion — Part 1]\nTable  2  summarizes  the  performance  of    CH3OH  production in different types of MBRs with their operation conditions for comparison between the IMBR and others [33-36].  We  designed  the  IMBR  to  reduce  energy  consumption for supplying gas in methanotrophic processes. In  the  IMBR,  gas  pressurizing  is  unnecessary,  because cells  on  the  membrane  are  placed  in  the  gas  phase.  In the  IMBR, the high   CH 3OH productivity was achieved, even  though  the  gas  flow  rate  was  0.2  mL    min -1 into 2.5 mL of a reaction volume (gas chamber) (dilution rate D = 0.08    min -1 ),  indicating low energy consumption for gas supply. The   CH 3 OH productivity (0.74 mmol   L -1 h -1 ) close to our data was achieved by Duan et al. using a different bacterial species than ours in a conventional MBR. However, in their paper, pure   CH 4 and   O 2 were supplied at  the  summed  flow  rate  of  112  mL    min -1 from  long tubes  into  300  mL  reaction  mixture  ( D = 0.37    min -1 ). To  supply  gas  from  tubes  to  the  bulk  water  medium,  a high pressure is usually required to overcome the transmembrane pressure. In addition, if we use pure oxygen, the   CH 3 OH productivity will improve, because oxygen is stoichiometry short from mixed gas of 20%   CH 4 and 80% air supplied in this study; more than 20%   O 2 is  required for  stoichiometric    CH 3 OH  production  from  20%    CH 4 and cell maintenance. As for conversion from   CH 4 into CH3OH, we cannot simply compare our values obtained by  the  continuous  product  discharge  with  the  value obtained by product accumulation in a batch system by Duan  et  al . However,  the  maximum  conversion  in  our batch operation was 60%, which was the similar level as the value shown by them. Of course, we should note that cell separation is unnecessary for purification of   CH3OH in the IMBR, unlike most of other methods [33, 34, 36] in Table 2.\n\nThe maximum consumption rate of CH4 was 58 μmol   h -1 in a 2.5 mL gas chamber when M. capsulatus (Bath) resting cells of 10 mg-DCW were used without the addition of cyclopropanol and formate in the system (Additional file 3), resulting in the specific   CH4 consumption  rate  of  5.8  mmol  g-DCW -1 h -1 ,  which  is  about  3 times lower than 18.46 mmol g-DCW -1 h -1 in literatures [37,  38].  This  was  probably  because cells  in  a  gas  phase reaction are in a resting condition [39]. It  is  reasonable to deduce that resting cells should consume less carbon sources than actively growing cells for the production of single cell protein.\n\nThe diffusion coefficient of CH 4 in air is  much larger  (0.22    cm 2 s -1 at  25  °C,  [40])  than  that  in  water (0.15 × 10 -4 cm 2 s -1 at 25 °C, [41]). However, the results shown in Fig. 4c suggested that the external mass transfer,  which  refers  to  the  process  of  delivering  reactants from the bulk phase to catalysts on a solid surface, was\n\nlimited in a flowing state in the gas chamber with a large size (25 mL). Then, the pattern of the gaseous flow in the gas  chambers  was  simulated.  This  result  predicts  that channeling  occurred  in  the  gas  flow;  most    CH 4 molecules  passed  through  without  contacting  the  biocatalysts before being exhausted from the outlet (Additional file 7a, b). In contrast, it was simulated that the gas flow in  the  small  chamber  was  distributed  into  a  disk-like shape and   CH 4 molecules  efficiently  contacted  the  cells on a membrane (Additional file 7c, d). However, it is predicted that the velocity of the gas flow was slower in the small region of the opposite side of the inlet, because the outlet  was  located  at  the  center  of  the  disk-shaped  gas chamber. Displacing the outlet to the opposite side of the inlet will improve the gas flow and spread the flow over the entire cells on a membrane.

{"chunk": "[Section: Discussion — Part 2]\nThe  concentration  of  cyclopropanol  should  be  optimized, because it introduces a kind of trade-off relationship  between  the  effectiveness  for  inhibiting  the  MDH activity  and  cell  or  MMO  activity.  When  the  cyclopropanol  concentration  provided  to  the  aqueous  solution increased from 0 μM, 1 μM, and 10 μM, the   CH4 consumption  ratio  decreased  from  11%,  10%,  and  3.7%, respectively,  while  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH increased  from  0%,  4.6%,  and  60%,  respectively  (Additional  file  5).  However,  the  slight  decrease  in  the    CH 4 consumption  ratio  to  2.9%  but  the  large  decrease  in the  maximum  conversion  to  19%  at  20  μM  cyclopropanol suggested that a high concentration of this MDH inhibitor  lowers  the  MMO  activity  (Additional  file  6). Therefore,  10  μM  was  the  optimum  concentration  of cyclopropanol  for  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH under  the  experimental  conditions  for  Fig.  6.  The  optimum concentration  of  cyclopropanol  seems  to  depend on the amount of cells; the decrease in the   CH 4 conversion into   CH3OH that was observed when the amount of the filtered cells increased from 12.5 mg-DCW to 25 mgDCW at 10 μM cyclopropanol, as shown in Fig. 5b, suggests  that  this  cyclopropanol  concentration  was  not enough to effectively inhibit MDH in the increased cells.\n\nIn the experiment shown in Fig. 3,   CH3OH concentration increased from 0 to 3.7 mM in 10 mL of the aqueous solution in 6 h, producing 37 μmol   CH3OH. At the same time, the concentration of formate in 10 mL of the aqueous solution decreased from 10 to 3.7 mM in 6 h, consuming 63 μmol formate (Additional file 1). This implies that 63 μmol NADH was generated, in which 37 μmol of\n\nNADH  was  used  for  methanol  production.  Therefore, 60%  of  NADH  generated  from  formate  oxidation  into CO2  contributed  to  methanol  production,  suggesting that 40% of the generated NADH was used for cell maintenance. It has also been reported in literatures that formate could be used by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b in  the  serine  pathway  for  carbon  fixation,  which  would compete  with  the  process  of  NADH  generation  [4,  36, 42].  The  high  productivity  of    CH 3 OH  in  the  proposed IMBR was maintained over 76 h of the continuous operation,  suggesting  the  long-term  stability  of  the  cells.  The continuous supply of formate and cyclopropanol is also thought to be important for keeping the stable activity to avoid the lack of reducing power and the decrease in the inhibitory activity for MDH.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/356", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 12, "bbox": {"l": 56.693, "t": 438.2929951171875, "r": 292.88, "b": 152.2069951171875, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/357", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 12, "bbox": {"l": 56.693, "t": 150.2929951171875, "r": 292.872, "b": 68.20699511718749, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/358", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 12, "bbox": {"l": 304.721, "t": 702.2839951171875, "r": 540.899, "b": 524.2209951171875, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "Discussion", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "The  concentration  of  cyclopropanol  should  be  optimized, because it introduces a kind of trade-off relationship  between  the  effectiveness  for  inhibiting  the  MDH activity  and  cell  or  MMO  activity.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 214, "document_start": 35895, "document_end": 36109, "length": 212}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "When  the  cyclopropanol  concentration  provided  to  the  aqueous  solution increased from 0 μM, 1 μM, and 10 μM, the   CH4 consumption  ratio  decreased  from  11%,  10%,  and  3.7%, respectively,  while  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH increased  from  0%,  4.6%,  and  60%,  respectively  (Additional  file  5).", "char_start": 214, "char_end": 542, "document_start": 36109, "document_end": 36437, "length": 326}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "However,  the  slight  decrease  in  the    CH 4 consumption  ratio  to  2.9%  but  the  large  decrease  in the  maximum  conversion  to  19%  at  20  μM  cyclopropanol suggested that a high concentration of this MDH inhibitor  lowers  the  MMO  activity  (Additional  file  6).", "char_start": 542, "char_end": 821, "document_start": 36437, "document_end": 36716, "length": 279}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "Therefore,  10  μM  was  the  optimum  concentration  of cyclopropanol  for  the  conversion  of    CH 4 into    CH3OH under  the  experimental  conditions  for  Fig.  6.", "char_start": 822, "char_end": 994, "document_start": 36717, "document_end": 36889, "length": 170}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "The  optimum concentration  of  cyclopropanol  seems  to  depend on the amount of cells;
