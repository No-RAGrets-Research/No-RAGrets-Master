Biogas from wastewater treatment plant was provided, instead of purified CH4, to provide operation and maintenance conditions of bio-catalyst reaction for efficient biological carbon fixation by bacterial community using methane and CO2 . This study assessed the conditions to induce type X methanotrophs that can use CO2 as a carbon source, as dominant species in the bacterial community and continuously and effectively supply reducing equivalents required for the conversion of CO2 to methanol within the system. Herein, the results of inducing efficient co-existence of methanotrophs, Methylophilus , and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria cluster in the bacterial community were shown.\n\nKeywords: methanotrophs; carbon fixation; Methylophilus ; ammonia-oxidizing bacteria; CCUS", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/3", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 55.516, "t": 486.9290146484375, "r": 86.087, "b": 472.6300146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/4", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 86.29, "t": 485.8420146484375, "r": 87.688, "b": 481.2290146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/5", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 35.77, "t": 461.6230146484375, "r": 153.091, "b": 335.7600146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/6", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 35.728, "t": 318.4900146484375, "r": 149.261, "b": 311.8800146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/7", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 36.0, "t": 294.60901464843755, "r": 116.931, "b": 287.99901464843754, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/8", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 35.728, "t": 282.6840146484376, "r": 122.573, "b": 276.07401464843747, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/9", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 36.0, "t": 270.75801464843744, "r": 124.77, "b": 264.14801464843754, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/10", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 35.707, "t": 245.38401464843753, "r": 154.248, "b": 202.99801464843745, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/11", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 35.728, "t": 156.76801464843754, "r": 154.359, "b": 66.68101464843755, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/12", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 36.0, "t": 632.5710146484375, "r": 548.8, "b": 623.3610146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/13", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 167.041, "t": 601.8290146484375, "r": 560.1, "b": 561.9950146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/14", "label": "list_item", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 166.555, "t": 558.7900146484375, "r": 370.406, "b": 551.2350146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/15", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 166.888, "t": 533.9660146484375, "r": 560.4, "b": 395.75401464843753, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/16", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 167.265, "t": 379.4430146484375, "r": 540.864, "b": 370.8280146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "An Experimental Study on the Biological Fixation and Effective Use of Carbon Using Biogas and Bacterial Community Dominated by Methanotrophs, Methanol-Oxidizing Bacteria, and Ammonia-Oxidizing Bacteria", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "/gid00030/gid00035/gid00032/gid00030/gid00038 /gid00001", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 55, "document_start": 235, "document_end": 290, "length": 55}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "/gid00033/gid00042/gid00045 /gid00048 /gid00043", "char_start": 56, "char_end": 103, "document_start": 291, "document_end": 338, "length": 47}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "/gid00031 /gid00028 /gid00047 /gid00032 /gid00046\n\n/gid00001\n\nCitation: Kim, I.-T.; Ahn, K.-H.; Lee, Y.-E.; Jeong, Y.; Park, J.-R.; Shin, D.-C.; Jung, J.

{"chunk": "[Section: 1. Introduction — Part 1]\nMethanotrophs can be used for various purposes, such as purification of environments polluted by chlorinated hydrocarbons or harmful heavy metals [1-3], removal of methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide [4], biological nitrogen fixation and denitrification [5], production of bio-methanol, [6-15], and production of bioplastics, such as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) [16,17]. Methanotrophs are bacteria that play an important role in the sustainability of the global environment. Previous studies on methanol production by methanotrophs mainly focused on a single species (mainly type II methanotrophs) and used nitrate mineral salts medium (NMS medium) or ammonium mineral salts medium (AMS medium) [18], which are chemically defined culture media [6-15]. However, chemically defined culture media and commercial media are expensive and generate chemical wastewater. In addition, to create the optimum conditions for a specific single species to enable it to continuously survive as an absolutely dominant species, manipulations, such as sterilization and blocking of external contaminations, are necessary, which are difficult to be carried out in uncontrolled environments outside the laboratory.\n\nTo date, high-purity methane (CH4 > 97%) has been used in the production of methanol by methanotrophs. Such production requires purification and separation processes, which are costly. In other words, previous studies lack consideration of realistic alternatives for economic feasibility and can only be conducted in controlled laboratory settings. To improve economic feasibility, certain studies have used biogas, instead of high-purity methane, as a realistic alternative, while others have sought to produce methanol from\n\nmethane, among other gases that form crude biogas [15-20]. However, these studies also targeted specific species to methanotrophs, limiting the application of the methods outside of laboratories.\n\nIn a previous study, for the first time, we used sewage flowing into an urban wastewater treatment plant as a culture medium, as well as biogas generated from a wastewater treatment plant in bio-methanol production [21]. In subsequent studies, we produced methanol using biogas as a carbon source and sewage as a culture medium and proposed a treatment process using the generated methanol as a carbon source for denitrification [22,23]. Furthermore, we investigated the bacterial community formation and the dominance of effectives species in reject water containing high concentrations of ammonia generated by anaerobic digesters in wastewater treatment plants, as well as the mutual roles and correlations between each bacterial cluster involved in the process [24].\n\nCompared to previous studies that used methane (a pure synthetic gas) and chemically defined or commercially sold culture media, our previous studies using biogas generated by wastewater treatment plants as a carbon source, as well as nutrient-rich sewage and wastewater as culture media, were different [21-24]. The biggest difference was that maintaining an effective single species as a dominant species, using wastewater and biogas, was not possible owing to biological contamination and interference, unlike in controlled laboratory environments. Bacterial clusters of different taxa accumulated to form a bacterial community in which the bacteria are interdependent. The formed bacterial communities were useful in methanol production and wastewater processing [21-24]. Another key difference from controlled laboratory conditions, where only pure methane was used, was the existence of new effectives species under high CO2 ratio of ≥ 30%. The key species in the bacterial community were the Methylophilus strains that used the methanol produced by methanotrophs. Additionally, new species of methanotrophs classified as type X have been observed in experiments using biogas, compared with those using only methane [24]. We observed that type X methanotrophs could convert CO2 into methanol if a reducing equivalent was present in the reaction system [25-28]. In the current study, for the effective use of CO2 in biological carbon fixation and wastewater treatment and for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), we explored biological carbon fixation using bacterial community and biogas.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/18", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 166.846, "t": 314.3620146484375, "r": 561.018, "b": 141.73001464843753, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/19", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 167.265, "t": 138.62001464843752, "r": 559.665, "b": 66.41301464843752, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/24", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 167.265, "t": 744.9930146484376, "r": 559.278, "b": 710.4450146484376, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/25", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 166.966, "t": 707.3350146484376, "r": 560.927, "b": 597.4680146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/26", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 166.767, "t": 594.3580146484375, "r": 561.019, "b": 358.9620146484375, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "1.

{"chunk": "[Section: 1. Introduction — Part 2]\nThe concept of CO2 fixation by methanotrophs first emerged following the discovery a new methanotroph species that produces methanol from CO2 through the Calvin-BensonBassham (CBB) cycle in the Verrumicrobia phylum. However, this species is a thermophilic methanotroph that inhabits high-temperature environments, such as volcanoes and hot springs; thus, it cannot be widely used for CO2 fixation [25-27]. However, some methanotrophs, such as type X methanotrophs, may be induced to become parts of bacterial community and use CO2 as a substrate to reduce excess CO2 into methanol [28]. In the first step of the process, methanotrophs proliferate using methane as a carbon substrate. In the second step, CO2 is reduced to methanol by the generated methanotrophs. Reduction of CO2 to methanol is the reverse reaction of methane oxidation to CO2. To reduce CO2 to methanol, a high reducing power is required to induce a reaction that is against the law of energy. In other words, NADH is required to reduce CO2 to formaldehyde, and pyrroloquinoline quinol (PQQH2) is needed to reduce formaldehyde to methanol [25-28].\n\nIn this study, we aimed to assess the optimum conditions for generating the driving force of reverse reaction against the law of energy in bacterial community through experiments, as well as to use this reaction to biologically fix and remove greenhouse gases, such as CH4 and CO2, for effective use in wastewater treatment. For these purposes, we efficiently maintained the bacterial community using biogas mainly consisting of CH4 and CO2 instead of manufactured or purified CH4 as carbon sources for bacteria. We also established the optimum conditions for generating methanotrophs capable of using CO2 as a carbon source, such as type X methanotrophs, as the dominant species in the bacterial community while efficiently and continuously providing the reducing power required to convert CO2 to methanol.\n\nClass\n\nFlavobacteria(0.17%)|\n\nHolophagae(0.24%)|\n\na carbon source, such as type X methanotrophs, as the dominant species in the bacteria community while efficiently and continuously providing the reducing power required t\n\nconvert CO2 to methanol.\n\nMethylomicrobium(2.12%)\n\nEU273938_g(0.06%)\n\n2.

{"chunk": "[Section: 2. Results and Discussion — Part 3]\nAprevious study by Muhammad and colleagues [33] may explain why Methylocystis strain was activated in our study. sMMO expression in Methylocystis sp. strain SB2 is not greatly affected by copper concentration, unlike that in other type II methanotrophs. In that study, the expression of methanobactins (mbnA) in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b was not affected by copper concentration; regardless of copper concentration (1 µ MCuCl2) in the culture, sMMO was expressed to encode a precursor polypeptide of methanobactin. Moreover, Methylocystis also have a higher capacity to synthesize poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) than other type II methanotrophs [34]. In addition to NADH, PHB also acts as an electron donor for the reduction in CO2, as it is a source of intracellular reducing equivalents. The NAD + -linked enzyme β -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase catalyzes PHB degradation into acetoacetic acid, which consequently results in reducing equivalents. Therefore, the PHB stored in the type II methanotroph Methylocystis plays an important role in the reduction of CO2 into methanol [34]. Thus, the coexistence of Methylocystis with type X methanotrophs under the culture conditions of this study is of great importance. greatly affected by copper concentration, unlike that in other type II methanotrophs.

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.3. Characteristics of CO2 Utilization by Methanotrophs through the Methane Oxidation Process — Part 1]\nResidual concentrations of CH4 and CO2 in the flask headspace were measured to indirectly estimate the utilization rates of CH4 and CO2 with reaction time. The initial condition of culture medium and biogas was maintained, not changed every 24 h. The relative distribution of Type X methanotrophs strains was highest in the microbial sludge where cultured cells were centrifuged and dehydrated under the conditions of CH4:CO2 ratio 2.5, as shown in Figure 5. The bacteria community was inoculated with 864 mg · L -1 based on the mixed liquid suspended solid (MLSS; Activated Bacteria Sludge). In the initial 0-24 hr stage, the CO2 consumption rate was -1.32 mL CO2 · day -1 , which inversely increased the CO2 content in the flask headspace. In the 72-96 h stage, as the CH4 consumption rate was significantly lowered from the initial 5.30 to 0.14 mL CH4 · day -1 , the CO2 consumption rate increased up to 2.37 mL CO2 · day -1 . This implies that CO2 was consumed at the same reducing equivalent as NADH formed in the methane oxidation process by Type X after methane was depleted. In this study, although the changes in CH4 and CO2 utilization rates with reaction time was not monitored all time, the difference in the consumption rate of the two gases was evident in Table 3. The initial increase in CO2 in the head space may have been due to bacteria ′ s respiration, which indirectly showed that the consumption rate of each gas was different, depending on the elapsed reaction, when methane and CO2 coexisted. The CO2 in the flask headspace rather increases due to the respiration of bacteria. Despite the initial CO2 content of 31.3%, the CO2 content of the biogas decreased to 22.6% after 96 h. From this result, the negative CO2 balance can be estimated by Type X methanotrophs.\n\nData represent the means ± standard deviations of three replicates (n = 3).\n\nBased on these findings, gas composition ratio according to reaction time was established to favor methane oxidation in the first half of the operation time, as well as to reduce and remove CO2 in the second half using reducing equivalents (NADH, PHB) formed through methane oxidation.\n\nAfter completion of methane oxidation by methanotrophs, reducing equivalents accumulated in bacterial cells as a source of CO2. Reducing equivalents were quantitatively confirmed from the amount of methanol produced. After methane oxidation reaction at a CH4/CO2/O2 ratio of 1:0.5:1, bacterial cells were centrifuged, as described in Section 2.1. Next, 835 mg · L -1 MLSS of dehydrated microbial sludge was added to the AMS medium. Subsequently, only CO2 and O2 (1:1), without CH4, were supplied into the head space for assessment of methanol production (Figure 6), which was then compared with that under control conditions using biogas. The NAD accumulated in bacterial cells existed in two forms: the oxidized and reduced forms [abbreviated as NAD + and NADH (H for hydrogen), respectively; NAD + + Formate ⇔

Characteristics of CO2 Utilization by Methanotrophs through the Methane Oxidation Process — Part 2]\nIn the control group cultured with biogas containing methane, methanol concentration increased to a maximum of 5.34 mM at 48 h and gradually decreased afterwards. However, under culture with CO2 only, methanol concentration in the culture medium increased to 0.12 mM within 24 h and then decreased rapidly. As methanol was formed at a low concentration, the reducing equivalents (NADH, PHB) in the bacterial cells were insufficient for type X methanotrophs to reduce CO2. To confirm whether CO2 reduction by type X methanotrophs can be accelerated with sufficient levels of reducing equivalents, 1 mM formate was added to form NADHs as electron donors from NAD + . At 24 h after the addition of formate, methanol concentration increased significantly to 1.32 mM. This suggested that  certain  methanotrophs, such as  type X  methanotrophs, in  the bacterial community cultured with biogas might fix and use CO2 if reducing equivalents were continuously supplied. However, the addition of electron donors, such as formate, is not economically  effective.  Thus,  electron  donors  must  be  continuously  recycled  and  reused within the system. In other words, for the biological fixation of CO2 by type X methanotrophs,  methane  must  be  present  until  formate  is  formed  by  the  MMOs  of  methanotrophs. The optimal reactor operation conditions that enable continuous supply of the reducing equivalents required for CO2 reduction may allow the biological fixation and effective use of CO2 by type X methanotrophs. The concentration of bacterial cells cultured in AMS medium was 720-860 mg ∙ L -1 . Accordingly, we artificially increased the concentration of bacterial cells to elevate the amount of available reducing equivalents in the cells to evaluate their effects.

Reduced NAD +  is converted to NADH and can be used as a reducing agent that can donate electrons. This electron transfer reaction is the main function of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NADH reduces another molecule (CO2 in our study) and is reoxidized to NAD + . Thus, the reaction is reversible. This suggests that coenzymes are not consumed, and that NAD +  and NADH can continuously alternate between the two forms [36]. In our previous study, methane is oxidized by MMO to produce methanol, and methanol oxidation continues to form NADH when formate is finally converted to CO2 by the formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzyme [36]. At this time, in addition to NADH, which was formed via oxidation by methanotrophs as a reducing equivalent that can be recycled within the system itself, the type II methanotrophs M. parvus and M. rosea also express sMMO  even  under  high  levels  of  copper,  thereby  generating  PHB  (Figure  4).  These Methylocytis species help provide the necessary reducing equivalents. The PHB synthesized by these Methylocytis species accumulate in the cells, making them efficient species for the generation of reducing equivalents [35]. Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria use ammonia as an energy source and partially oxidize methane through the action of ammonia monooxygenase [1,31]. Ammonia monooxygenase level in ammonia-oxidizing bacteria is lower than MMO level owing to the competition between methane and ammonia, however, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria can oxidize methane to produce methanol [37]. Hydroxylamine (NH2OH) produced during ammonia oxidation by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria can also act as an electron donor [31,38]. When ammonia is present in the culture, NH2OH is spontaneously formed as an electron donor during oxidation of ammonia by ammoniaoxidizing bacteria. When such a system is used in water treatment, nitrate and methanol produced at this point are sent to the anoxic condition denitrification reactor in the biological nitrogen removal process, in which they help the internally generated methanol to be used as a carbon source by denitrifier bacteria, contributing to the role of the generated NAD + is an oxidizing agent that is reduced by accepting electrons from other molecules.

Biogas was injected into 30% of the upper space filled with air, and the product was stored at 4 ◦ C for use in subsequent experiments. As ammonium was the material of interest in this study, AMS medium containing a high concentration (10 mM) of ammonium chloride was prepared in the laboratory and used as a nitrogen source instead of NMS medium, which is commonly used for culturing methanotrophs [41]. Copper (CuSO4) concentration in the final medium was 20 µ Mfor all medium formulations. The media were buffered to pH 6.8 through the addition of 1.5 mL phosphate buffer (26 g/L KH2PO4, 33 g/L Na2HPO4).\n\nNext, 10 g of purified activated sludge sample stored at 4 ◦ C was added to a 350 mL flask containing 200 mL of AMS medium solution.

{"chunk": "[Section: 4. Conclusions]\nThis study propose the use of biogas generated from an urban wastewater treatment plant and a bacterial community comprising methanotrophs, Methylophilus , and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, as an effective method of biological carbon fixation and nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment for CCUS. A significant level (11.2%) of type X methanotroph strains were identified only in methanotrophs cultured with CO2 and biogas. Following culture with CO2 only, higher cell concentration of bacterial community and greater relative ratio of type X methanotrophs were observed with increasing methanol production. At type X methanotroph ratio of 19% and cell concentration of 1025 mg · L -1 , the maximum methanol concentration of 0.41 mM was achieved. The most ideal reaction in bacteria community was determined in this study. Biological fixation of CO2 by type X methanotrophs was occurred using reducing equivalents, such as NADH, PHB, and NH2OH, which were accumulated in the reactor and cells by methanotrophs (Type I, Type II, and Type X), methylophilus and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Based on these findings, it would be possible to set a response system with conditions favorable for the oxidation of methane, methanol, and ammonia in the first half of the operation time and to reduce CO2 using reducing equivalents (NADH, PHB) for biological fixation in the second half of the operation time.\n\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, methodology, investigation, writing-original draft preparation, I.-T.K.; formal analysis, K.-H.A.; visualization and writing-review and editing, Y.-E.L., Y.J.; investigation, J.-R.P., D.-C.S., J.J.; supervision, project administration, I.-T.K.
