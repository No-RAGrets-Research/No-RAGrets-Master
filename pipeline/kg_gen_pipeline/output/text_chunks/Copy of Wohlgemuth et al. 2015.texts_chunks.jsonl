Continuous processing and bioprocesses have been recognized as the most important key green engineering research areas by pharmaceutical and fine chemicals manufacturers alike [13,28]. Continuous operations have major benefits in reduced costs, equipment size, energy consumption, solvent utilization, and waste. Furthermore, high product quality can be maintained in highly automated production plants incorporating control loops. Numerous applications such as 24/7 manufacturing, multistep synthesis, and repetitive or routine steps are possible [29].

Reaction rate acceleration due to the reduction in diffusion path and increased mass transfer in twophase systems within microscale reactors is the most suitable driving force for bioprocess intensification. Time\n\nConsidering toxicity and biocatalyst deactivation, various studies have proved the benefit of using microscale technology. Continuous microprocessing with multi-input addition of toxic substrates was suggested to prevent catalyst inactivation [94]. Almost 2 months of production at maximal volumetric productivity was enabled by the continuous feed of a toxic substrate and in situ product extraction over a silicone tube that prevented the inhibition of Pseudomonas sp. cells performing asymmetric epoxidation of styrene [95]. The use of a flow reactor enabled higher quantities of oxidant to be employed for lipase-mediated oxidation of alkenes over prolonged periods of time without deactivation of the biocatalyst [62]. Very short reaction times for acrylamide synthesis in microreactors also greatly weakened the inhibition of Rhodococcus ruber cells by acrylonitrile and acrylamide. Furthermore, the temperature of this exothermic reaction could be much more efficiently controlled compared with traditional stirring in a conventional reactor leading to additional lowering of biocatalyst deactivation and prevention of byproduct formation [91].\n\nAnother critical parameter for enzyme-catalyzed reactions is leaching of enzymes from solid beads, contaminating products and reducing biocatalyst (immobilized enzyme) lifetime. A study of ringopening polymerization of e -caprolactone to polycaprolactone using a packed-bed microreactor with Candida antarctica lipase-B in the form of Novozym 435 indicated that enzyme leaching from porous beads was lower in microreactors compared with batch reactors [32].\n\nThe last boundary of the bioprocess window of operation (Figure I) is the efficiency of downstream processing.

{"chunk": "[Section: Biocatalyst configuration]\nBiocatalysts in microreactors can be used in soluble form or flow freely through the reactors in the form of channels [25,49-51] or with integrated membranes enabling enzyme separation and recycling [52,53].

{"chunk": "[Section: Simulations enabling process development]\nMany biocatalytic processes at the microreactor scale have been theoretically described using validated mathematical models on the macroscopic level. Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3).\n\nTime\n\nh\n\nS\n\nIS\n\n15\n\n- Ab initio pm\n\nEngineering design\n\n- Scale-up, scale-out, numbering-up\n\nDownstream\n\nMicroreactor\n\nEngineering

{"chunk": "[Section: Challenges in microreactor technology for manufacturing]\nThe move from traditional batch reactors to continuous-flow processes in industrial manufacturing remains slow due to several perceived barriers [16,77,78]. Standardized reactor modules that can be combined in various sequences to test novel biocatalytic processes are crucial for rapid development. The feasibility of a wide area of dimensionand timedependent biocatalytic reactions can be explored at the microscale. High space-time yields, high selectivity, and complete conversion are key goals in process intensification and resource efficiency. Microreactors are also of interest for rapid process development if PAT matches the reaction timescale [79,80]. Real-time product analysis is key for quality by design (QbD) of the manufacturing process.\n\nHighly innovative and systematic approaches, protocols, tools, and strategies are currently being developed to minimize the gap between research and industry and between the laboratory and full-size manufacturing scale and to define the smooth transfer of a well-developed, safe, scalable, robust, and economic (bio)chemical process to the industrial environment [29,81,82]. Advances in biocatalyst discovery to biocatalytic microprocess design require not only a new level of understanding of reaction mechanisms and transport phenomena at the microscale, but also computational tools and advanced microsensors to optimize and control bioprocesses in working environments from chemical and energy resources to products. It is important to define key performance indicators as development targets early in projects toward economically viable bioprocesses. Few studies consider increasing the volumetric production rate at the microscale, to design equipment for larger-scale production, and to perform holistic process analysis (e.g., for complex biobased molecules whose production in microdevices remains at an early stage [83]). Microreactor-based synthesis of chiral amino alcohols using threonine aldolase and large-volume finechemical synthesis (gluconic acid synthesis with glucose oxidase) reveal that enzyme loading and activity are not yet sufficient for large-volume, low-cost chemicals, al-\n\nmicro-units\n\nthough they are adequate for high-value products where enzyme costs can be overcome by recycling [23,47,84]. In practice, challenges related to the handling of particles and slurries, often leading to clogging of microscale channels and thereby preventing stable microscale reactor operation, as well as differences in capacities of unit operations, necessitate customized reactor design and make plug-andplay construction difficult to realize in practice [85].", "provenance": [{"docling_ref":

Development of a microfluidic platform for directed evolution, using water-in-oil-droplet compartments for screening [37], plays a significant role in faster process development, while multi-inlet microfluidic reactors for controlled addition of inhibitory/toxic substrates [22] and microfluidic devices with entrapped biocatalysts using a magnetic field [69] indicate new possibilities for the establishment of highly efficient biocatalytic processes with long-term stability. The further expansion of microreactors into process development will proceed from established analytical platforms using both continuous and droplet assays. Reductions in development time and cost can be achieved by activity-based reaction screening as a function of pH, temperature, reaction conditions, and substrate scope or by end point determinations. Multiphase flow conditions, where flow instabilities, fast biocatalyst inactivation, and low conversion rates are often encountered [26,27], provide opportunities for process intensification. Continuous processes will constitute a key research area for the engineering of green and sustainable processes [28]. Microscale technology and flow chemistry is not yet used as much for manufacturing as is batch reactor technology and myths of it not being useful for production persist. Therefore, to be convincing, documenting and reporting the significant advantages for a rapidly growing range of reaction types, in direct comparison with batch reactor technology, is essential. The recent microreactor synthesis of ibuprofen in three sequential reaction steps with each reaction completed within 1 min, leading to an overall reaction time of 3 min and 83% overall yield, demonstrates the capabilities of continuous-flow manufacturing for multistep syntheses using small-footprint reactors [86]. The further development of more precise reaction control in microreactors by suppressed formation of undesired products or byproducts, as well as in situ preparation of reactive species only when they are needed, will enable telescoped flow synthesis from simple precursors [87]. The higher efficiency of microreactors over batch systems for biphasic gas/liquid systems offers the merits of more convenient protocols [87,88] and the tools for new synthetic manufacturing routes. Reagents can be prevented from destructive interactions and the formation of undesired byproducts by introducing reagents at specific stages of the microscale system, leading to a broader substrate scope and higher reactivity and yield compared with batch processes [88]. An (R)-selective v -transaminase with pyridoxal-5 0 -phosphate immobilized on methacrylate beads in organic solvent enabled the transamination of ketones in a microreactor with a residence time of 30-60 min, > 99% enantiomeric excess (ee), and excellent mass recovery, demonstrating a clean production system without additional work up and purification [67].
