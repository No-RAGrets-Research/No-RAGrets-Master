Methane-rich biogas has low power density so cannot be considered as a good substrate for the microbial fuel cell. The power density of methane-rich biogas can be increased by its conversion to methanol. Twostep strategy has been followed for the production of methanol from methane-rich biogas and its utilization in a microbial fuel cell. Methanol production using methanotrophs is an attractive way for  the  valorisation  of  waste-derived  biogas.  Besides  this,  methanotrophs  have  been  used  in converting  the  methane-rich  biogas  into  a  variety  of  bioproducts  which  include  single  cell protein, polyhydroxyalkanoate bioplastics, biodiesel, extracellular polysaccharides, propylene oxide,  and  human  health  supplements.  This  paper  focusses  on  the  biological  conversion  of methanol in which solid-state anaerobic digestate can be used for the isolation of methanotrophic bacterium.  A  fresh  isolate  possesses  the  characteristics  which  resembled  to  constrained methanotrophs from the methylocaldum genus. This freshly new isolated methanotroph evolved on purified methane or biogas and successful production of methanol is accomplished from the biogas.  This  study  also  deals  with  the  effect  of  formate  and  various  inhibitors  of  methanol dehydrogenase  for  the  biological  conversion  of  methanol  and  where  the  formate  act  as  an electron  donor.  But  isolate  produced  methanol  without  any  electron  donor  with  the  help  of phosphate. Moreover, isolate also produced methanol without methanol dehydrogenase inhibitor by the use of formate. The maximum quantity of methanol consists of an optimum quantity of formate  and  phosphate  as  a  growth  medium.  This  study  reveals  an  efficient  conversion  of methanol from biogas using solid-state anaerobic digestate. The produced methanol will not go for  the  purification  process  and  can  be  used  directly  in  a  microbial  fuel  cell  for  the  power generation purpose.\n\nKeywords: Methanotrophs;

{"chunk": "[Section: 1.  Introduction]\nMillion tons of biomass wastes which include crop residues, food wastes, and animal manure are generated [1]. These generated biomass waste can be used for energy production and different types of valuable products. Anaerobic digestion technology can help in degradation of role in these biomass\n\nwaste for the biogas production [2]. Biogas generally contains methane (CH4), carbon dioxide (CO2), and less quantity of contaminant gas which includes ammonia (NH3) and hydrogen sulfide (H2S). The major drawbacks of biogas are its low energy density and are costly as well difficult to store, distribute and transport. That's why bi ogas in small scale anaerobic digester (AD) is often gets flared and wasted [3].  Biogas  can  also  be  captured  from  landfills  and  can  be  used  as  renewable  fuels.  Biogas  can  be converted  to  compressed  natural  gas  as  well  as  liquid  chemicals  via  thermochemical  processes  [4]. Biological conversions are generally more attractive than thermochemical conversions [5]. A diverse group of bacteria commonly known as methanotrophs uses monooxygenase (MMO) for the oxidation which converts methane to methanol. These bacteria consume two reducing equivalents for the oxidation of a single molecule of methane. Normally, formate dehydrogenase (FDH), methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), and formal dehydrogenase (FalDH) further result in oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide (CO2) w hich generates reducing equivalents of six per molecule of methanol. That's why, production of methanol with methanotrophs is accomplished by the use of MDH inhibitors such as phosphate and sodium chloride (NaCl), and usually provides external electron donors which are generally formatted to carry out the metabolic activity and survival of methanotrophs [5]. Biological upgradation of biogas using  methanotrophs  is  an  interesting  approach  to  add  the  value  to  the  waste-derived  methane  gas because  methanotrophs  grow  at  ambient  pressure  and  moderate  temperature,  can  utilize  a  low concentration of methane (CH4) which is generally less than 20%, and capable of producing methanol at high efficiency [5-7].\n\nTrickle bed bioreactors have a fascinating design for the cultivation of methanotrophs because of their low costs and limited power requirements as compared to that of membrane bioreactors [8, 9]. Trickle bed bioreactors (TBRs) are a type of cylindrical packed reactors which is packed with inert materials having high specific surface area [10]. A thin layer of liquid is provided on the packing surface by circulating the nutrient medium through the trickle bed bioreactor (TBR) while gases are blown up either  co-current  or  counter-current  to  the  liquid  [8].  In  this  study,  the  two-step  process  has  been discussed for the generation of power from methanol derived from biogas.\n\nMethanotrophs  isolation  can  improve  the  feasibility  of  methanol  production  from  the  biogas. Isolation of methanotrophs from various sources such as waste treatment facilities, natural gas fields, and soils [5]. Few studies also focus on the production of methanol by methanotrophs isolation from hydrogen-rich anaerobic digester using biogas as a source [11]. Methanotrophs can last long without oxygen and can uses biogas as their main source of carbon as well as carbon. This paper focusses at the role  of  formate  and  inhibitors  of  MDH  for  the  biological  conversion  of  methanol,  Isolation  and characterization  of  methanotrophs  from  the  solid  state  anaerobic  digester,  comparison  of  purified methane (CH4) and biogas as a substrate for isolation of methanotrophs.

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.1. Methanotrophs isolation]\nEight samples of digestate can be collected from solid-state AD reactors. The quantity of each sample should be 5g [12]. The switchgrass and anaerobically digested wastewater sludge in the ratio of 3:1 can be fed into one liter solid-state AD reactors. Total solids (TS) required for controlling the solid-state reactor is either 20% or 30%, and incubation period under mesophilic conditions (36±1) is 70 days. The variation in methane yield of solid-state AD reactors is varied from 88 l/kg VSadd (TS of 30%) to 113 l/kg VSadd (TS of 20%) [12]. The procedure of isolation is the modified version of protocols explained in Dedysh and Bowmen [13, 14].\n\nThe incubation of solid-state AD samples can be performed in 250 ml flasks which consisted of nitrate mineral salts medium (45 ml per flask). The nitrate mineral salts medium consisted of 0.2% (v/v) of  chelated  iron  (Fe)  solution  along  with  0.284  g/l  of  sodium  diphosphate  (Na2HPO4),  1.0  g/l  of magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO4 ·7H 2O), 0.134 g/l of calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2 ·2H 2O),\n\n0.272 g/l of Monopotassium phosphate (KH2PO4), 1.0 g/l of potassium nitrate (KNO3), and 0.05% (v/v) of a trace element solution. The chelated iron (Fe) solution consisted of 2 g/l of Ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  (EDTA),  1  g/l  of  ferric  (III)  ammonium  citrate,  and  0.3%  (v/v)  of concentrated hydrochloric acid in deionized water. The composition of trace element in solution includes 200 mg/l of Iron(II) sulfate heptahydrate (FeSO4 ·7H 2O), 30 mg/l of Boric acid (H3BO3), 10 mg/l of Zinc sulfate (ZnSO4 ·7H 2O), 500 mg/l of EDTA, 20 mg/l of Cobalt(II) Chloride hexahydrate (CoCl2 ·6H 2O), 3.0  mg/l  of  Sodium  molybdate  dihydrate  (Na2MoO4 ·2H 2O),  1.0  mg/l  of  calcium  chloride  dihydrate (CaCl2 ·2H 2O),  3.0  mg/l  of  Manganese(II)  chloride  tetrahydrate  (MnCl2 ·4H 2O),  and  2.0  mg/l  of Nickel(II) chloride hexahydrate (NiCl2 ·6H 2O) in deionized water. The initial pH of nitrate mineral salts should lie in the range of 67. The rubber stopper can be used for sealing the flasks and 0.2 μm of a filtered mixture of pure methane (99% purity) should be filled in the headspace of the flasks and 1:4 (v/v) of a CH4: air ratio can be selected. The incubation temperature of 37 °C and continuous shaking with 200 rpm can be followed. After the completion of three days, an enriched culture of 5 -10 ml should be transferred into new flasks having 40 -45 mL of freshly nitrate mineral salts (NMS) medium and similar ratio of methane to air can be followed. This process has to be repeated every three days. After the completion of 25 days, the enriched mixture has to be spread on the nitrate mineral salt agar plate. These plates will be incubated in an anaerobic jar at a temperature of 37 °C for 1-2 weeks having headspace of air and methane (CH4) in the ratio of 1:4 (v/v). The freshly nitrate mineral salts plates could have been selected for streaking of selected individual colonies until single colonies based on size, shape, and color are visible. The obtained isolates should be shifted to 1 ml of nitrate mineral salts (NMS) medium in a sealed vial of 15 ml capacity with the reactor headspace containing 0.2 μm of filtered methane and air in the ratio of 1:4. The incubation temperature of 37 °C can be followed by shaking at 300rpm until the visible increase of turbidity in culture. Light microscopy can be used for determining cell morphology.
