{"chunk": "[Section: 13.1  Introduction]\nMethane-oxidizing bacteria (methanotrophs) are natural systems for the attenuation of methane emission. These microbes can use methane as their sole source of energy and carbon and thus are unique systems for methane-based bioconversions. The industrial potential of methane metabolism has actively been discussed for almost a half a century. Methanotrophic cultures have been tested for the production of single-cell protein (SCP), 1,2  polyβ -hydroxybutyrate (PHB), 3  components for nanotechnological applications, 4 lipids, 5 and carotenoids 6  and as a carbohydrate feedstock for fermentation. 7,8  A number of methane-driven transformations, such as epoxidation, calcium carbonate precipitation, bioleaching, biofiltration, and bioremediation, have also been explored. 9-15  However, only the production of methanotrophic SCP (such as BioProtein/Norferm, Norway,\n\nhttp://calysta.com; UniProtein/Unibio, Denmark http://www.unibio.dk, and Gaprin, Russia, http://atelgroup.org/en/biotechnology) using a mixed culture with Methylococcus capsulatus has remained a commercially established product. A number of factors contributed to the slow progress in methane-based biotechnology, including the increased energy prices in the late 1970s to early 1980s, which reduced the attractiveness of natural gas as a carbon feedstock. By the early 1990s it had already been concluded that the future of C 1 biocatalysis lays in the production of high-cost products, 16 although difficulties in the genetic reprogramming of methanotrophic bacteria together with fairly cheap chemical fossil-based synthesis almost completely eliminated the attention given to bioconversions.\n\nResurgence of interest in the industrial application of methane biocatalysis is occurring now. The energy market landscape (cheap natural gas vs expensive oil) and energy boom in the United States are most likely the main drivers of the new wave of attention being given to methane. 4,5,17-19 However, history shows that this interest can easily decline in parallel with oil prices. Experts in the field believe that new methane-based technology must go beyond short-term economic considerations and focus on long-term sustainability. It is important to remember that methane is a very controversial source of energy-one which comes with an exceptionally large environmental footprint. 20,21  Anthropogenic methane emission accounts for more than 60% of the greenhouse gas budget and it is the number one target for global climate regulation. 22 Fossil fuel production (e.g., underground coal mining, oil-associated gas, and natural gas pipelines/compressors) is the first target for new technologies. However, the technology can also benefit other areas, such as agriculture (e.g., enteric fermentation in livestock, manure management, and rice cultivation), landfills, municipal wastewater, and rising biofuel production. 23,24  Up to 116 million tons of oil-associated methane and 40 million tons of biogas (equivalent to 27% of the total United States transportation fuel) are flared each year. Any gas flare, from small to large, represents lost energy, lost revenues, and unnecessary CO 2 emissions. Gas flares are also a dangerous source of air pollution. A search for new environment-friendly approaches for methane capture is an ongoing journey, and it is not yet apparent which innovation might represent the best solution. If developed, methane biocatalysis could fill this niche and the technology would certainly withstand future oil-price drops and rises.\n\nMicrobial biotechnology is grounded on the fundamental knowledge of related systems. Our understanding of methane utilization has changed dramatically in recent years. A number of novel microbial strains with novel metabolic arrangements of methane utilization have been described. The new microbes inspire conceptually novel ideas for the intensification of methane conversion and stimulate new elaborations in the area. This chapter summarizes the most recent development in microbial methane biocatalysis. Several strategies are outlined below for streamlining the selection of microbial systems for biotechnological alterations. These include metabolic considerations and the physiological advantages or constraints of specific microbial cultures.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/42", "label": "text", "pages":

{"chunk": "[Section: 13.2  Methane Biocatalysis: Basic Concepts — Part 1]\nTwo fundamentally different mechanisms of methane utilization are known: oxygen dependent (mostly aerobic) and oxygen independent (anaerobic). Aerobic methane oxidation (AMO) relies on oxygen for methane activation and oxidation and has thus far been described for Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia, and NC10 phyla. Oxygen-independent methane oxidation is based on reverse methanogenesis. A number of anaerobic methane oxidation (AnMO) couplings have been proposed. 25,26\n\nSo far only aerobic fermentation with methane has been proven at the large scale, demonstrating that safe and efficient operation is achievable. However, when realized at the industrial scale, methane catalysis appeared to be more expensive then was initially projected. 16  One of the overlooked economic aspects of methane-based conversion could have been the cost of oxygen, the second compound required for the process. Today a number of alternate strategies for methane conversion, which engage nitrate, sulfate, or three metal oxides to fulfill oxygen's functions, are being discussed. Below, the cost of each conversion is estimated based on the current prices of the nutrients required for methane oxidation.\n\nAerobic methane conversion requires an oxygen input with at least a 1:1 methane to oxygen ratio. Oxygen is widely available, but it is a pricy feedstock. The cost of oxygen is directly linked to energy cost (mostly electricity) and might vary from $100 to $125 per ton. 27 That estimation would bring the cost of aerobic methane conversion to at least $200-$250 per one ton of methane (Figure 13.1). In fact, high cell growth would actually require higher oxygen input (at 1:1.5-2 methane to oxygen ratio) making the cost of AMO conversion even higher, up to $375-$500 per ton of methane.\n\nThe cheapest AnMO process is the one linked to sulfate reduction (SR). With the price of sulfuric acid ranging from $25 to 100 per ton (www.icis.com), the AnMO-SR conversion would cost $30-$600 per ton of methane; the price would be much higher ($1000-$1500) if sulfates are used. AnMO supported by denitrification (which requires 4 mol of nitrate per 1  mol of methane oxidized) is about $3400 per ton of methane if nitric acid is used [at the price of $215-$225 per ton (www.icis.com)] and at least $7600 per ton if sodium nitrate is used. AnMO supported by metal oxides comes with a remarkably high price tag (Figure 13.1).\n\nOther factors challenging the applicability of AnMO-based technology which are rarely discussed in the literature are its overall process sustainability and possible environmental impact. The current markets for sulfuric acid/sulfates, nitric acid/nitrates, and metal oxides are quite narrow, and they would have to be expanded significantly to support methane catalysis. For example, the conversion of flared oil-associated methane (estimated to be at least 116 million tons) would require 696 million tons of sulfate, but the global annual production of sulfuric acid is only 200 million tons (http://www.essentialchemicalindustry. org) while sodium sulfate is only 16-17 million tons (http://www.cefic.org).\n\nMO rate: 30 mmol g-1 h-1\n\nAssimilation pathways:\n\nRuMP,

{"chunk": "[Section: 13.2  Methane Biocatalysis: Basic Concepts — Part 2]\nOverview of aerobic and anaerobic methane oxidation: microbes, parameters, by-products, and economics. DCW, dry cell weight; MO, methane oxidation; RuMP, assimilatory ribulose monophosphate pathway; SC, serine cycle; EMP, ethylmalonyl-CoA pathway; CBB, Calvin cycle; WLP, the reductive acetyl-CoA (Wood-Ljungdahl) pathway; *, pathway is present only in some species. Cost of methane conversion was estimated based on the methane conversion equations (25-26, and below) and current price of electron acceptors (taking from www.icis.com).\n\nAnother aspect that challenges the AnMO process is that intensive oxidation of methane requires significant input of sulfate or nitrate into the cultivation environment. Assuming that the rate of AnMO is in the same range at AMO, or about 20 mmol h -1 g -1 dry cell weight (DCW), a bioreactor with about 30 g DCW per liter would consume sodium sulfate at the rate 58.8 g  h -1 L -1 and sodium nitrate at the rate 37.2 g  h -1 L -1 . That indicates that the AnMO-based\n\nprocess has to be built using strains capable of tolerating high salt (halophiles) or, if electron acceptors are added as acids, extremely low pH (acidophiles). That would remain true even for an alternate host of the AnMO modules.\n\nEven with a very cursory look, AnMO-based technology might have dramatic environmental impacts. The ANMO-SR mode is directly linked with the formation of volatile sulfur compounds, such as H 2 S. This mode of methane oxidation would not be feasible for technological applications unless a sustainable solution for conversion of H 2 S back to sulfate or elemental sulfur is found. In theory, that could also be accomplished via biological pathways, such as photosynthetic sulfur oxidation linked to light, oxygen, or nitrate. 28  The AnMO-DR system might leak toxic intermediates and dangerous greenhouse gases, such as NO, N 2 O, and ammonia. Like SR, some impacts of the denitrification process could be complimented by additional (bio)technological modules, such as coupling to ammonium oxidation. 29  That, however, also requires additional breakthrough developments in areas beyond methane biocatalysis.\n\nTaking into account all three parameters discussed for AnMO-based technologies (cost, sustainability, and environmental impact), AMO remains the more feasible solution for a methane-based technology if it is considered for a wide deployment. However, the AnMO process might be beneficial for some areas.

Among the pathways commonly predicted for formaldehyde conversion in methanotrophic bacteria are the oxidation through H 4 folate or H 4 methanopterin intermediates 1,51  and the dissimilatory ribulose monophosphate phosphate (dRuMP) pathways. 52  The cofactor-linked pathways generate 1 mol of NADH per 1 mol of formaldehyde converted to formate. The dRuMP pathway leads to the production of 2 mol of NAD(P)H and 1 mol of CO 2 per 1 mol of formaldehyde. Formate oxidation is typically carried out by NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenases containing molybdenum or tungsten. 45,48,53", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/138", "label": "text", "pages":

{"chunk": "[Section: 13.4.1  CH 2 O to Biomass Conversion]\nThe two key enzymes of the CH 2 O to biomass conversion, 3-hexulose 6-phosphate synthase (EC 4.1.2.43, Hps) and 3-hexulose 6-phosphote isomerase (EC 5.3.1.27, Hpi), are responsible for condensation of formaldehyde on ribulose 5-phosphate (R5P) to form hexulose 6-phosphate and its conversion into fructose 6-phosphate. Hps and Hpi are core enzymes for C 1 assimilation in methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria. 117  Theoretically, three variants of the RuMP pathway could be predicted, including the Entner-Doudoroff pathway (EMP) (glycolytic) variant (also known as FBP variant); the Entner-Doudoroff (EDD) pathway (KDPG variant); and the bifidobacterium shunt (BS) variant (also known as phosphoketolase, Xfp variant, also proposed as a biocatalytic methanol condensation cycle (Figure13.3)). 1,118,119\n\nSerine cycle in methanotrophs\n\nwithout ppc\n\nPartial serine cycle (acetyl-CoA only)\n\n(Continued)\n\n(Continued)\n\nAll of these pathways can be identified in genomes of most methanotrophic Gammaproteobacteria (but S. and Kalyuzhnaya M.G., unpublished). However, it has been shown that most C 1 carbon (about 75%) enters the glycolytic route in two methanotrophic strains, Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z and Methylomonas sp. LW13. 47  The FBP variant of the RuMP is the most efficient pathway for C 1 assimilation (Figure 13.3a). It enables the conversion of 3 mol of formaldehyde into 1  mol of a three-carbon compound (assumed to be 2-phosphoglycerate for the convenience of balancing) with the generation of 1  mol NADH and 0.7  mol A TP . 47 In M . alcaliphilum 20Z and Methylomonas sp. LW13 part of the cell carbon (about 25%) is assimilated via the KDPG variant (Figure 13.3b), which requires 2 mol of ATP and generates 1  mol NADH upon assimilation of 3  mol of formaldehyde into 2-phosphoglycerate.\n\nA number of phosphoketolases (EC 4.1.2.9, Xfp), a key enzyme of the bifidobacterial shunt, have been detected in all sequenced Gammaproteobacteria (but S. and Kalyuzhnaya M.G., unpublished).

{"chunk": "[Section: 13.7  Concluding Remarks]\nWhile aerobic methanotrophs are often seen as the most credible systems for methane biocatalysis, it should be kept in mind that natural microbes typically do not experience selective pressure for high rate/high CCE of methane utilization. In most environments, methanotrophic bacteria are part of a very complex community, and their functions realized under different environmental constrains such as nutrient limitation, competition, synergistic interactions, or predation. Such wild cultures possess specialized metabolic networks (which might rely on activities of other members of the community) and complex signaling mechanisms (which activate in response to high population density), and those might lead to granulation or lysis. Obviously, these factors might impact the performance of the selected strain in 'man-made' settings or upon industrial scale-up.\n\nWhen comparing all known clades of methane utilizers, it is not surprising that Gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs are the winners. They have the highest growth rate and the highest CCE of methane utilization, which is not surprising when their highly efficient arrangement of methane utilization is taken into account. However, both Alphaproteobacteria\n\nand Verrucomicrobia offer some additional advances that keep them on the consideration list: (1) only Verrucomicrobial methanotrophs can tolerate extremely low pH and they are an attractive system for the conversion of methane sources into organic acid and (2) so far only Alphaproteobacterial methanotrophs have shown metabolic flexibility. They are able to use other sources of carbon in addition to C 1 compounds. That makes them a unique system for the manipulation of C 1 machinary for biological production of methanol from methane. In addition, the ability of some members of the group to co-utilize short alkanes has obvious benefits for natural gas conversion. Finally, these microbes have a high flux of carbon into CoA-derivatives, such as acetyl-CoA and crotonyl-CoA.\n\nA number of pathways have been described for anaerobic methane consumption, but none of them can be driven by a single pure culture. The methane oxidation in the NC10 phylum is driven by aerobic MMO, but mechanisms supporting how the cells generate oxygen remain unclear. The slow rate of methane oxidation, the lack of pure cultures, the need for expensive electron acceptors, the generation of toxic by-products (such as H 2 S or ammonia), and the need for conceptually new approaches for genetic manipulation restrict the largescale deployment of anaerobic methane conversion today.
