{"chunk": "[Section: 1 | I NTRODUCTION — Part 1]\nIn the fight against climate change, the most predominate greenhouse gas (GHG) is carbon dioxide ( CO2 ), followed closely by methane ( CH4 ), which is less abundant but significantly more potent per mol (Chidambarampadmavathy et al., 2015; Conrad, 2009; Shukla et al., 2022). CH4 is 25 to 84 times more potent GHG over 20 years than CO2 due to its strong radiative forcing (Allen, 2015; Isaksen et al., 2011; Neubauer, 2014; Pachauri & Mayer, 2015; Solomon et al., 2007). While CO2 is the main focus, due to its substantial amounts that is produced yearly, CH4 plays a significant factor as well with several initiatives being set in place to reduce its emissions (Nisbet et al., 2020; Shindell et al., 2012). Up to 63% of the atmospheric CH4 originates from human activity with 6875 million metric tons being released into the atmosphere every year (Solomon et al., 2007). Excess CH4 in the industry is mostly burned for energy production. This further contributes to the accumulation of climate active gas in the atmosphere. Additionally, in Europe, especially in Germany, significant methane production capacity through biogas plants is located, which currently channel methane primarily into energy production. However, with upcoming reductions in government funding through the EEG, there will be a shift towards alternative, nonenergy usage (FNR, 2019; OIES, 2019). For one of those alternative applications, methane should be considered a valuable source of both carbon and energy for methanotrophs.\n\nMethanotrophic microorganisms are capable of metabolizing CH4 for diverse purposes, including biomass, methanol, or biopolymer formation, as documented in literature (Foster & Davis, 1966; G ę sicka et al., 2024; Helm et al., 2006; Karthikeyan et al., 2015; Whittenbury et al., 1970). The concurrent reduction of potential GHG emissions and the generation of valuable products, such as animal feed or bioplastics, enhances the attractiveness of these microbial processes for industrial applications. The model organism Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) stands out as the current state -of -the -art for methanotrophic bacteria (Chidambarampadmavathy et al., 2017; G ę sicka et al., 2021). Notably, M. capsulatus has been reported to possess the ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen ( N2 ) (Chidambarampadmavathy et al., 2017; Murrell & Dalton, 1983). This capability provides a significant advantage over other methanotrophs, allowing for the cultivation of M. capsulatus without the need for additional nitrogen sources in the medium. Understanding the impact of varying nitrogen levels and exploring growth dynamics in the absence of nitrogen in the culture broth (e.g., potential reductions in growth or increases in product formation) is crucial for optimizing these processes (Pieja et al., 2012). The combination of screening for diverse microorganisms and optimizing cultivation processes is essential to successfully achieve the outlined objectives. This is of particular importance in gas fermentations where gas transfer limitations are a common issue (Munasinghe & Khanal, 2010; Pauss et al., 1990; Yasin et al., 2015).\n\nHowever, existing methods for gas fermentations screening and optimization processes often face limitations: they are either too slow and costly when implemented in bioreactors or lack the capability to monitor critical parameters, such as gas transfer rates, in serum flasks. Furthermore, serum flasks, which are not continuously gassed, exhibit a dynamic change in gas composition over time. This varying gas composition poses additional challenges in comparing serum flasks results to large -scale experiments. Cultivating methanotrophic bacteria poses an additional challenge, primarily attributed to the necessary gas composition utilized for aeration. While oxygen ( O2 ) is a common gas for aeration, CH4 is not, due to its possible explosive nature in combination with O2 . Working with CH4 requires special safety precautions if both O2 and CH4 are used in the same process. The required ATmosphéres EXplosibles (ATEX) precautions can be costly and time consuming, hindering the screening of methanotrophs even further.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/37", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 45.637, "t": 703.1069995117188, "r": 288.447, "b": 409.9509995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/38", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 45.246, "t": 404.1129995117188, "r": 288.443, "b": 84.9319995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/39", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 45.637, "t": 79.09299951171874, "r": 288.518, "b": 45.92799951171878, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}, {"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 306.487, "t": 729.0759995117188, "r": 549.707, "b": 578.9489995117187, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "1 | I NTRODUCTION", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "In the fight against climate change, the most predominate greenhouse gas (GHG) is carbon dioxide ( CO2 ), followed closely by methane ( CH4 ), which is less abundant but significantly more potent per mol (Chidambarampadmavathy et al., 2015;

{"chunk": "[Section: 1 | I NTRODUCTION — Part 2]\nIn this paper, three gases are of importance: O , CH 2 4 , and CO2 . While O2 and CH4 are consumed, CO2 is produced during cultivation processes. The changes of the partial pressures of these gases are reflected in the transfer rates and correlate with the metabolic activity of the bacteria. Transfer rates offer vital insights into the processes by providing information about growth rates, gas transfer limitations and metabolic effects over the course of cultivation. With monitored oxygen transfer rate (OTR) and carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR), the respiratory quotient (RQ) can serve as an indicator for the current consumed carbon source and much more (Anderlei et al., 2004; Finger et al., 2023; Pastoors et al., 2023). In addition to the transfer rates themselves, the ratios between them can also provide essential information. With the additional CH4 measurements, additional ratios can be calculated: the oxidation quotient (OQ) and the carbon quotient (CQ). The OQ describes the ratio of needed O2 to metabolize the consumed CH4 and should give insights into the carbon and energy metabolization of the cultures. Analogous, the CQ is the ratio of consumed and respired carbon in the form of CH4 and CO2 , respectively. CQ can be used to monitor the biomass production and the efficiency of the CH4 metabolization.\n\nThis work aims to develop a method to monitor CH4 transfer rates in shake flasks based on the existing Respiration Activity MOnitoring System (RAMOS) technology. RAMOS is a noninvasive method to monitor the OTR and CTR in shake flasks (Anderlei & Büchs, 2001; Anderlei et al., 2004). The technology has been firmly established for screening in shake flasks for both aerobic cultivations, as well as anaerobic cultivations (Mann et al., 2021; Munch et al., 2020). To further increase the capabilities of the RAMOS technology, methane transfer rate (MTR) monitoring was added to the RAMOS technology to cultivate methanotrophs while monitoring all gases involved in the process. This newly extended device will be referred as the methane RAMOS device. It allows the screening of methanotrophic bacteria in shake flasks, as well as the optimization of their cultivation conditions and process parameters.\n\nIn this work, the cultivation of methanotrophs in the RAMOS device as well as the MTR capabilities of the RAMOS technology are evaluated with M. capsulatus as a model organism. Different metabolic effects like transfer limitations and growth on atmospheric nitrogen were investigated to show the capabilities of the methane RAMOS technology in observing both biological phenomena, as well as process limitations.\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY\n\nshaker\n\n02.\n\nCH4\n\nsensor sensor sensor", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/40", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 306.879, "t": 573.9569995117188, "r": 549.662, "b": 318.0459995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/41", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 306.879, "t": 313.9629995117188, "r": 549.665, "b": 136.97599951171878, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/42", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 2, "bbox": {"l": 306.879, "t": 131.08199951171878, "r": 549.648, "b": 45.92899951171876, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/45", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 9.999999640000008, "t": 772.3619994050521, "r": 89.99999964000001, "b": 761.6953327383854, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/46", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 110.5417586543748, "t": 755.0800346466356, "r": 135.88542554582466, "b": 746.310631188994, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/47", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 228.44466024174753, "t": 755.0286662021949, "r": 235.10485441650482, "b": 749.0286662021949, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/48", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 246.42718437277668, "t": 755.6953329117188, "r": 258.4155338873398, "b": 749.0286662450521, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/49", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 219.78640750058253, "t": 745.0286661183854, "r": 285.0563104132039, "b": 739.0286661183854, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "1 | I NTRODUCTION", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "In this paper, three gases are of importance: O , CH 2 4 , and CO2 .", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 68, "document_start": 7284, "document_end": 7352, "length": 68}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "While O2 and CH4 are consumed, CO2 is produced during cultivation processes.", "char_start": 69, "char_end": 145, "document_start": 7353, "document_end": 7429, "length": 76}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "The changes of the partial pressures of these gases are reflected in the transfer rates and correlate with the metabolic activity of the bacteria.", "char_start": 146, "char_end": 292, "document_start": 7430, "document_end": 7576, "length": 146}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "Transfer rates offer vital insights into the processes by providing information about growth rates, gas transfer limitations and metabolic effects over the course of cultivation.", "char_start": 293, "char_end": 471, "document_start": 7577, "document_end": 7755, "length": 178}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "With monitored oxygen transfer rate (OTR) and carbon dioxide transfer rate (CTR), the respiratory quotient (RQ) can serve as an indicator for the current consumed carbon source and much more (Anderlei et al., 2004;

{"chunk": "[Section: 2.1 | Transfer rate monitoring in RAMOS device — Part 1]\nValve\n\nAll cultivations were conducted in the RAMOS device adapted from Schulte et al. (2018), Munch et al. (2020), and Mann et al. (2021) to monitor gas transfer rates in shake flasks. In addition to the monitoring of OTR and CTR, CH4 sensors were added to monitor the MTR. This new device was labeled methane RAMOS. The in -gas entered the temperature -controlled shaker and was distributed over capillaries ( ∅ = 0.1 mm) to ensure a homogeneous gas distribution to all eight flasks. Each flask was connected to a measurement loop containing a piezo -membrane pumps mp6 -gas (Bartels Mikrotechnik) and a variety of sensors. The built -in sensors included O2 sensors (Max -250, Maxtec), infrared CO2 sensors (MSH -P -CO2, Dynament) and differential pressure sensors type 26PCA (Maxwell Technologies). The CO2 sensors have an operating temperature range from ∘ -20 C to ∘ +50 C with a measurement range of 0 -5 vol% ±0.05 vol% CO2 . Additionally to the previously described setup, CH4 sensors (INIR -ME100%, Angst+Pfister Sensors and Power AG, n.d) were added to the device. These digital sensors use an infrared light source to measure the concentration of CH4 in the gas phase and generate a temperature compensated digital output. According to the manufacturer's datasheets, the sensors have a measurement range of 0 -100 vol% ± 0.1 vol% CH4 and their performance is verified for a temperature range from -40 to ∘ +75 C . Humidities from 10% to 90% relative humidity were also verified. To determine the interference of humidity, CO2 and hydrogen ( H2 ) on the CH4 sensors, gas compositions between 0 -20 vol% CO2 , 0 -80 vol% H2 , and humidified nitrogen were tested and no significant effect on the measured CH4 concentrations could be observed (Figure S4).\n\nThe gas sensors were combined in a custom 3 -D printed sensor block (DraftGrey) and connected to the measurement loop. A polyjet printer J850 Pro (Stratasys) was used to print the sensor blocks. 3 -D printing enabled rapid prototyping with reduced costs in contrast to manually turned and milled metal blocks (Figure S1). The material itself, as well as the final setup were assessed for gas tightness to\n\n|\n\nprevent gas leakage that could interfere with the measurement. A complete schematic illustration of the whole setup can be found in Figure 1.\n\nThe measurement consists of a repeating cycle between an aeration and measurement phase. During the aeration phases, the flasks are continuously aerated to keep a constant gas composition. During the measurement phase, all valves are closed, resulting in a closed system for each flask. The gas is circulated through the measuring loop by the piezo -membrane pumps and the sensors measure the gas composition over time. The change in gas composition within the headspace of the flasks is used to calculate the transfer rates of the gases. Additionally, the pressure change in the flasks is measured, which is used to calculate the gross gas transfer rate (GGTR). The OTR, CTR, and GGTR were calculated during the measurement phase according to the equations in (Anderlei & Büchs, 2001; Anderlei et al., 2004). In accordance with the other transfer rates, the MTR was calculated according to Equation (1): Valve\n\nwith MTR (mmol/L/h) as the methane transfer rate, n ch 4,m the moles of CH4 (mmol) consumed during the measurement phase, V L (L) the liquid filling volume of the shake flask, t m (h) the duration of the measurement phase, p Δ CH4 (bar) the change of CH4 partial pressure in the measurement phase, Vg (L) the gas volume in the shake flask, R (83.14 bar L/mmol / K) the standard gas constant, and T (K) the temperature.\n\nThe GGTR is the sum of all consumed gases minus the sum of all produced gases (Equation 2). This can be calculated from the total pressure change in the flasks over the measurement phase. The GGTR equals the sum of the OTR and MTR minus the CTR:\n\nwith n m the total moles (mmol) consumed during the measurement phase, VL (L) the liquid filling volume of the shake flask, tm (h) the\n\nFIGURE 1 Schematic of the methane Respiration Activity MOnitoring System (RAMOS) device including methane sensors. Gas with a defined composition is introduced into a temperature -controlled shaker. The in -gas, controlled by a mass flow controller, is distributed to the eight flasks over capillaries to ensure equal gas distribution between all flasks. Each flask is connected to a measuring loop with O , CH 2 4 , and CO2 sensors. Pressure sensors connected to the loop measure the pressure change in the flasks.

The following parameters from the experiments were used for the calculations: Osmol: 0.1 Osmol/kg, n : 350 revolutions per minute (rpm); V L : 10 mL; d 0 : 50 mm; d : 85 mm:\n\n75\n\n50\n\n25\n\n0\n\nwith the MTR and the already described OTR, the OQ can be calculated analogous to the RQ according to Equation (4):\n\nAnalogous, the ratio of consumed and exhausted carbon, the CQ, can be calculated with Equation (5):\n\nInstead of using pressured air or N2 to aerate the flasks, a gas mixture of O , CH 2 4 , and CO2 was used. An ATEX consideration was performed before cultivation to ensure safe operation of the device. The chosen gas composition was selected to ensure safe operation of the device by guaranteeing it to stay outside of the explosive area of CH4 and air as displayed in Figure 2. The gas was composed of 5.9 vol% CH4 and 3.4 vol% O2 . The blue dot indicates the initial gas composition. In the chart, the red area describes the ATEX state, where O2 is available in excess, as well as CH4 being present within the lower and upper explosive limit. It is to be noted that the lower explosive limit of CH4 (4.4 vol%) is exceeded in the in -gas (CHEMSAFE, 2014; Prendes -Gero et al., 2022). In case of a leakage and the gas is diluted with air, the gas composition moves along the green line. Due to the low O2 concentration below the limiting oxygen concentration of 9.9 vol% O2 , by the time that enough O2 is present, the CH4 concentration is diluted sufficiently to be outside of the explosive area. CO2 with a concentration of 1.3 vol% was added to the in -gas, because it has been reported that an improved growth rate can be observed with an increased CO2 concentration in the in -gas (Henard et al., 2021).

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.1 | Cultivation of M. capsulatus in RAMOS device]\nM. capsulatus was cultivated in NMS using the RAMOS device described above with OTR monitor capabilities. This initial approach was crucial for validating both the compatibility of the device with methanotrophic microorganisms and its suitability for the specific gas composition used in the experiments. Similar to the experimental approach outlined by Munch et al. (2020) and Mann et al. (2021), the energy and carbon source, CH4 , is continuously supplied through the gas phase. Accordingly, the process is a fed -batch cultivation in respect to the carbon in form of CH4 . Furthermore, varying filling volumes ranging from 5 to 20 mL were used to investigate the impact of the filling volume on transfer rates. The results are displayed in Figure 3.\n\nAll cultures show initial exponential growth with a growth rate of 0.36 h -1 . This aligns perfectly with the measured maximum specific growth rate coefficient ( μ max ) by Zhivotchenko et al. (1995). After 10 h for the high filling volumes to 13 h for the lower filling volumes, the growth of the cultures starts to decelerate. After 19 h, OTR plateaus form at around 23, 14, 11 and 8 mmol/L/h for the filling\n\nFIGURE 3 Cultivation of Methylococcus capsulatus in Respiration Activity MOnitoring System (RAMOS) device. Oxygen transfer rate (OTR) for different filling volumes of M. capsulatus in RAMOS device with CH4 continuously supplied as substrate. The theoretical OTRmax values for each filling volume are displayed as dotted lines. The courses of the cultivations with 5 mL filling volume were shifted by 2 h to be aligned with the other courses. The difference in lag time is due to varying initial OD600 s of the cultures. The experiments were conducted in duplicates, with the average values represented as a line and the min/max values illustrated as error shadows. It is important to note that the filling volume of 15 mL was not monitored in duplicates due to a malfunctioning O2 sensor. Cultivation conditions: NMS medium, c = 30 buffer mM MOPS), ∘ T = 37 C , n = 350 rpm, d 0 = 50 mm, V = 5 - 20 L mL, initial OD = 0.1, initial pH = 6.8, N = 1 -2. Only every 20th data point over time is indicated by the corresponding symbol; c = 5.9 in -gas vol% CH4 , 3.4 vol% O2 , 1.3 vol% CO2 , 89.4 vol% N2 .\n\n48\n\n22\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY\n\n20\n\n|\n\n--\n\nGas transfer rate [mmol/L/h]\n\n18\n\n16\n\n-— CTR\n\nvolumes 5, 10, 15, and 20 mL, respectively. The monitored values of the OTR plateaus decrease with increasing filling volumes. This indicates a gas transfer limitation, as the gas transfer from the gas phase to the liquid phase is limited, preventing higher transfer rates (Anderlei et al., 2004). Additionally, the OTRmax values correlate with the maximum transfer capacity for the tested cultivation conditions (dotted lines) with slight offsets towards lower values.\n\nThe correlation from Meier et al. (2016) has been shown to accurately estimate the OTRmax across a wide range of process parameters in shake flasks using air as the in -gas. For the tested parameters -shaking diameter (1.25 -10 cm), flask diameter (51 -131 mm), filling volume (2 -160 mL), and shaking frequency (100 -450 rpm) -the correlation consistently predicts the OTRmax within a range of ±5 mmol/L/h. In this study, the measured OTRmax values were only 1 -2 mmol/L/h lower than the predicted values despite a significant reduction in the in -gas oxygen concentration from 20.9 to 3.4 vol%. This demonstrates that the correlation performs well even under altered gas conditions, with the measured values aligning closely with the predicted range. These results further confirm the validity of the methane RAMOS device for the cultivation of M. capsulatus using the given gas composition.\n\n20.95 vol% O2 (Figure S2). An additional effect is the dilution of the O2 content with the produced CO2 . During the exponential growth phase, the O2 content in the headspace reduces notably (Figure S3). These two effects seem to influence the O2 gradient between the gas and liquid phases, resulting in the gradual formation of a plateau instead of a sharp turn.\n\nThis experiment shows that the RAMOS device is applicable for the cultivation of M. capsulatus . The different transfer rates can be monitored successfully and expected values are obtained. Moreover, the correlation from Meier et al. (2016) for air (20.95 % O2 ) seems to be applicable for different O2 concentrations (here 3.4 vol% O2 ) in the in -gas as well.\n\n72", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/121", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 306.878, "t": 586.0929995117187, "r": 549.638, "b": 435.9709995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/122", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 306.638, "t": 430.0759995117188, "r": 549.661, "b": 357.9609995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/123", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 45.187, "t": 326.9329995117188, "r": 208.646, "b": 43.8069995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/124", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 5, "bbox": {"l": 213.12621352563107, "t": 577.6953328117188, "r": 223.78252420524277, "b": 569.6953328117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/127", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 19.31456307682524, "t": 772.3619995450521, "r": 27.972815504009706, "b": 765.6953328783854, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/128", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 9.999999452380962, "t": 771.6953329117188, "r": 89.33333278571429, "b": 762.3619995783854, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/129", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 19.314563076270225, "t": 754.3619995367187, "r": 27.972815503454694, "b": 748.3619995367187, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/131", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 59.811, "t": 761.0079995117188, "r": 61.561, "b": 749.1749995117187, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/132", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 64.60388339524272, "t": 752.3619995450521, "r": 73.26213582242718, "b": 750.3619995450521, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/133", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 9.324266733364418, "t": 732.3620001183854, "r": 17.982529323198687, "b": 611.0286667850521, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/134", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 19.980582524271846, "t": 737.0286662450521, "r": 27.972815533980583, "b": 730.3619995783854, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/135", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 19.980582518721686, "t": 719.028666233941, "r": 28.63883494590615, "b": 712.3619995672743, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/136", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 37.297087381970876, "t": 741.6953328600521, "r": 65.26990291595146, "b": 735.6953328600521, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/137", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 45.638, "t": 729.0729995117188, "r": 288.432, "b": 643.9199995117187, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/138", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 45.638, "t": 638.0819995117188, "r": 288.432, "b": 461.9369995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/139", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 306.487, "t": 729.9759995117188, "r": 549.652, "b": 656.9589995117187, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/140", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 306.879, "t": 651.0639995117187, "r": 549.626, "b": 578.6209995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/141", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 6, "bbox": {"l": 301.04077669347896, "t": 570.3619995950521, "r": 312.3631067905663, "b": 560.3619995950521, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "3.1 | Cultivation of M. capsulatus in RAMOS device", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "M. capsulatus was cultivated in NMS using the RAMOS device described above with OTR monitor capabilities.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 105, "document_start": 20720, "document_end": 20825, "length": 105}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "This initial approach was crucial for validating both the compatibility of the device with methanotrophic microorganisms and its suitability for the specific gas composition used in the experiments.", "char_start": 106, "char_end": 304, "document_start": 20826, "document_end": 21024, "length": 198}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "Similar to the experimental approach outlined by Munch et al.

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.2 | Methane transfer rate monitoring in shake flasks — Part 1]\nUnlike previous studies that reported sharp turns in O2 transfer limitations with air, our study observed a plateau that gradually approaches the OTRmax (Anderlei et al., 2004; Stöckmann et al., 2003). This difference can be attributed to the low O2 concentration in our study, which results in a dynamic change in the O2 gradient between the gas and liquid phases throughout the measurement phase. During this phase, the O2 concentration in the headspace slightly decreases due to consumption by the culture. While such changes are usually negligible in aerobic cultivations, they become more significant in gas fermentation scenarios where the O2 content is low. In our case, the O2 content is only 3.4 vol% O2 and decreases up to 10% during the measurement phase, a stark contrast to aerobic cultivations that have\n\nAfter demonstrating the feasibility of the RAMOS device for M. capsulatus cultivation, the methane RAMOS described in Section 2.1 was used to cultivate M. capsulatus as illustrated in Figure 1. A filling volume of 10 mL was chosen for subsequent cultivations. The monitored transfer rates (OTR, CTR, MTR, and GGTR) are displayed in Figure 4, encompassing all gases being consumed or produced during the experiment. M. capsulatus was cultivated in NMS for 72 h to observe the growth and different transfer rates of the culture. The data shown is an average of two biological replicates.\n\nAll curves follow a similar pattern to the cultivation in Figure 3, with an initial exponential growth phase. After 12 h, the growth starts to decelerate. After 19 h, a plateau forms at around ( 15.5 ± 0.33 ) mmol/L/h for OTR, ( 7 ± 0.52 ) mmol/L/h for MTR, and ( 6.5 ± 1.1 ) mmol/L/h for CTR. The MTR and CTR align after 26 h. The CTR shows a higher noise signal than the OTR and MTR signals, attributed to one CO2 sensor measuring slightly reduced CO2 levels.

While the GGTR is noisier due to the sensitive pressure sensor, a plateau at ( 17.4 ± 1.38 ) mmol/L/h can be observed during the limitation.\n\nThe plateau in the OTR indicates a gas transfer limitation, as seen in Figure 3. The reached OTR values align with the theoretical OTRmax calculated after Meier et al. (2016), with the observed offset of around 2 mmol/L/h. In contrast, the MTRmax calculated with equation (3) is significantly higher than the observed values, leading to the conclusion that CH4 was not limiting during the cultivation. The observed courses strongly suggest the presence of O2 limitations. Notably, the transfer rates are intricately linked to the consumption of both O2 and CH4 , with these gases being co -consumed. Consequently, there exists a restriction on the amount of CH4 that can be metabolized, manifesting as observed plateaus. These plateaus represent an additional constraint, resulting in carbon limitation. The final pH of the cultivation was 7.2, which lies well within the pH optimum of the organism (Geymonat et al., 2011; Whittenbury et al., 1970). The increase in pH is either due to the consumption of substrates (e.g., KNO3 ) from the medium or the production of unknown metabolites. Over the course of the cultivation, a total of ( 436 ± 1.1 ) mmol/L CH4 and ( 950 ± 23 ) mmol/L O2 were consumed during the cultivation. ( 385 ± 57 ) mmol/L CO2 were produced. The theoretical ratios of the gases produced and consumed can be derived from the stoichiometric biomass equation described by Villadsen et al. (2011) in equation (6).

{"chunk": "[Section: 3.3 | Molar gas balances — Part 1]\nClosing the molar gas balance is a good indicator for the validation, as well as the accuracy of the transfer rate monitoring. Methanotrophic microorganisms consume O2 and CH4 and produce CO2 as shown in Equation (6). When considering all gases, the summation of consumed O2 and CH4 , minus the produced CO2 , should precisely match the total gas produced, as outlined in Equation (2). This equilibrium should manifest as a bisector characterized by a slope of 1. The comparison of the combined gases over the GGTR is displayed in Figure 5. After starting the experiments, the flasks are still filled with air and it takes some time (~1 h) for an equilibrium to be reached within the headspace. This leads to inaccurate measurements for the first data points and thus are ignored for the parity plot analysis.\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY\n\n0 h\n\n72 h\n\n• ' Slope 1.45\n\nThe data points are distributed around the bisector with a slope of 1, indicating a closed molar gas balance. This clustering indicates a robust alignment of the observed data with the expected trend. A mean of 0.89 mmol/L/h and a deviation of <0.9 mmol/L/h between the theoretical and the measured values can be measured. The R 2 of 0.91 shows a strong correlation between the monitored and the calculated values. All gas transfer rates are well within acceptable margins, demonstrating precision even in the presence of inherent noise from the pressure sensor. This proofs a closed molar gas balance and a high accuracy of the transfer rate monitoring. These outcomes collectively affirm the robustness and precision of the experimental approach, reinforcing the credibility of the obtained results and underscoring the reliability of the established methodology.\n\nFor aerobic fermentations, the RQ is a well -established quotient. It is defined as the ratio of the produced CO2 and the consumed O2 and gives detailed insights into the metabolism of cultures (García et al., 2020; Heyman et al., 2020; Müller et al., 2018; Romero -Kutzner et al., 2015). Using different rates allows for the calculations of additional quotients with even further insights into product formation, such as the CORQ for carbon monoxide cultivations Mann et al. (2021). With the OTR and MTR of the methane RAMOS, the OQ and the CQ are calculable. The OQ describes the ratio of the consumed O2 to CH4 in the form of their respective transfer rates and should offer similar insights (see Figure 6). The initial values cluster slightly above an OQ of 1.45 for OTR values below 10 mmol/L/h during the exponential growth phase of the cultures. These findings are in line with the theoretical values for unlimited growth of 1.45 O2 per CH4 , as described above. Existing models predict a shift in the ratios towards higher O2 consumption during gas transfer limitations and agree with the monitored values as well (Lieven et al., 2018). At higher OTR values above 10 mmol/L/h, the OQ shifts towards 1.8, indicating a change in metabolism in the cultures. Comparing the values with Figure 4, it becomes obvious that the shift towards a ratio of 1.8 occurs during the gas transfer limitation phase indicated by the already described plateaus.\n\nSlope 1.80\n\nDuring that time, the cultures consume more O2 per CH4 and the transfer limitation restricts the oxidation of CH4 . The cultures switch away from biomass formation to a more energy -efficient metabolism, which is reflected in the ratio of 1.8 O2 per CH4 . Subsequently, a reduction in biomass formation is expected, as well. Since the organism would ideally consume the gases in the preferred ratio of 1.45, the fact that this ratio shifts towards a reduced CH4 consumption per O2 shows that O2 is limiting. The available O2 is increasingly used for energy conversion, instead for biomass formation. With further increasing biomass and a stable gas consumption, the O2 per CH4 ration increases further. Towards the end of the cultivation, a ratio slightly above 2.0 O2 per CH4 (see Equation 7) is reached. This shift suggests the halting or drastic reduction of biomass formation and a full switch towards maintenance metabolism. The CQ supports this as well, with values around 0.5 during the exponential growth phase (Figure S6). During the shift into the O2 limitation, the CQ shifts towards a ratio of 0.7. During the limitation, the CQ increases to 0.9. This trend implies that M. capsulatus predominantly respires most of the assimilated carbon as CO2 , rather than utilizing it for biomass or product synthesis.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref":

As a result, the medium contained KNO3 concentrations of 0, 0.15, 0.3, and 1 g/L. The first 48 h of the OTR and MTR courses are shown in Figure 7. The whole courses are displayed in Figure S7.\n\nRegardless of the supplied nitrogen concentration, all cultures exhibit growth, as indicated by increasing transfer rates.

Cultures with KNO3 in the medium show a comparable exponential growth phase for the initial 9 h. After 9 h, the courses diverge depending on the supplied nitrogen concentration. Observable shifts occur in both the OTR and MTR courses. Following these shifts, the transfer rates continue to rise, resulting in an OTR plateau of around ( 15 ± 0.99 ) mmol/L/h across all cultures.

These shifts in the transfer rates indicate the depletion of KNO3 within the medium, representing the switch from nitrate consumption to nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere. The OTR and MTR integrals at the time of the shifts\n\nTime [h]\n\n|\n\n(a)\n\ncorrelate with the provided nitrogen; doubling nitrogen concentrations results in a twofold increase in the corresponding OTR and MTR integrals (Figure S8). Calculating the total converted CH4 until nitrogen depletion yields ( 17.8 ± 0.7 ) mmol/L CH4 for 0.15 g/L KNO3 and ( 34.9 ± 0.91 ) mmol/L CH4 for 0.3 g/L KNO3 , corresponding to the theoretical nitrogen requirement of 116 mmol ∕ g CH KNO 4 3 .\n\nThe 1 g/L KNO3 cultures do not exhibit any shift. Theoretically, the shift should be visible after 26 h based on the CH4 per KNO3 fixation ratio. However, at this time, the plateau has already been reached, obscuring the shift. It is expected that the culture is nitrogen limited at this point as well, and that the cultures undergo nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere.\n\nCultures without nitrogen (0 g/L KNO3 ) show a longer lag phase, with an exponential growth phase starting at around 6.5 h. These cultures reach an O2 limitation at ( 15 ± 0.8 ) mmol/L/h after 48 h. Both the cultures without KNO3 , as well as the cultures with reduced KNO3 concentrations exhibit growth, showing an increase in the OTR signal following nitrogen depletion. The data demonstrates that M. capsulatus can grow without KNO3 being present in the medium by fixing nitrogen from the atmosphere. Nevertheless, KNO3 improves culture growth by increasing growth rates and significantly reducing the lag phase, due to the increased energy demand of the nitrogen fixation (Guo et al., 2022).\n\n|\n\nAll cultures exhibit an O2 limitation around the same OTR values of 15 mmol/L/h after 40 -48 h, depending on the supplied concentrations of KNO3 . The courses are highly comparable to the experiments in the previous sections with similar OTR plateau values and growth rates.\n\nAfter 100 h, the respiration of all cultures starts to cease and the OTR and MTR values decrease. This suggests that the cultures may be limited by a secondary substrate or by the accumulation of inhibitory metabolites, which have not been determined. Between 160 and 220 h, the OTR values start to decrease faster, nearing 0 mmol/L/h at the end of the cultivation. Once all OTR values reach around 1 mmol/L/h, the cultivations were stopped.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/190", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 21.333333302564103, "t": 771.6953328732571, "r": 31.99999996923077, "b": 764.3619995399239, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/191", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 9.999999640000008, "t": 772.3619994050521, "r": 89.99999964000001, "b": 761.6953327383854, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/192", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 11.333331395215472, "t": 761.6953330347957, "r": 20.66666854324607, "b": 712.3619997014623, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/193", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 21.999999966666667, "t": 739.0286662061632, "r": 31.333333300000003, "b": 732.3619995394965, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/194", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 21.3333332974359, "t": 707.6953328732571, "r": 31.999999964102567, "b": 700.3619995399239, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/195", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 25.333333300000003, "t": 691.0286662450521, "r": 31.333333300000003, "b": 684.3619995783854, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/196", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 26.66666535065647, "t": 630.3619999783854, "r": 32.00000122712131, "b": 602.3619999783854, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/197", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 25.011083262735127, "t": 597.7278447393434, "r": 32.464316663715756, "b": 472.99498544572356, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/198", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 9.423899476052037, "t": 705.7497164735787, "r": 21.338756704649047, "b": 450.96781543191213, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/199", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 39.33333331014493, "t": 742.3619995184821, "r": 108.66666664347827, "b": 733.0286661851487, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/200", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 44.888, "t": 729.0729995117188, "r": 288.453, "b": 643.9199995117187, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/201", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 45.638, "t": 638.0819995117188, "r": 288.448, "b": 435.9699995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/202", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 161.28251644242997, "t": 428.58701229966056, "r": 204.7174834834456, "b": 418.1369867411889, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/204", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 533.707, "t": 760.1699995117187, "r": 535.457, "b": 749.4529995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/206", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 311.3333331933333, "t": 763.6953329383854, "r": 327.99999986, "b": 754.3619996050521, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/207", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 306.879, "t": 729.0729995117188, "r": 549.639, "b": 655.0219995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/208", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 306.879, "t": 651.8529995117187, "r": 549.644, "b": 578.9489995117187, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/209", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 9, "bbox": {"l": 306.129, "t": 573.8439995117188, "r": 549.657, "b": 435.9709995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/213", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 63.836, "t": 761.0079995117188, "r": 65.586, "b": 749.1749995117187, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/214", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 45.638, "t": 729.9759995117188, "r": 288.448, "b": 669.9419995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/215", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 45.638, "t": 664.1039995117188, "r": 288.443, "b": 578.9519995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "chronological color key", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "20\n\nBIOTECHNOLOGY\n\n[mmol/L/h]\n\n16\n\n12\n\n0\n\n• N\n\nON 0\n\nMethane transfer rate [mmol/L/h] Oxygen transfer rate\n\n- 0.15 g/L KNO3\n\nPetersen et al., 2019;

{"chunk": "[Section: chronological color key — Part 2]\nThe MTR data consistently reflects the observed trends in the OTR data, further validating and providing insights into the experimental findings. Both the delayed growth for the 0 g/L culture, as well as the shifts in the growth phases for the 0.15 and 0.3 g/L cultures, are visible in the MTR data. The transfer rate ratios of the 1 g/L KNO3 cultures are similar to the previous experiments, with an OQ shift from 1.45 towards 1.9 during the oxygen limitation (Figure S9). Cultures with reduced KNO3 display an increased OQ to 1.9 significantly earlier during the nitrogen shift and maintain it until the end of the cultivation. The cultures without KNO3 in the medium exhibit an OQ of 1.9 during the whole cultivation, indicating severe growth limitation and in turn reduced biomass formation. The assimilated carbon of all cultures, in the form of the CQ, also demonstrates this (Figure S10). The courses of the 1 g/L KNO3 are highly comparable with the CQ courses from Section 3.2. During the unlimited growth phase, the CQ is around 0.6, indicating a balanced carbon metabolism, including biomass formation. Concurrently to the increasing OQ, the CQ increases to between 0.8 and 0.9, indicating a shift towards a metabolism prioritizing energy utilization over biomass formation. The nitrogen limited cultures show an CQ of around 0.9 from the beginning, indicating less carbon to biomass conversion, in addition to the prolonged lag phase. As reported, nitrogen fixation is an energy demanding process Jang et al. (2023), which explains the reduction in biomass formation and the increased CQ values. Online data monitoring using the methane RAMOScan effectively identify these changes, enabling the estimation of necessary nitrogen concentrations for optimal growth in a single shake flask experiment.\n\nCultures with KNO3 in the medium exhibit an increased growth rate in the OTR values before reaching the KNO3 depletion. Calculating the μ max using the formula from Stöckmann et al. (2003) results in a growth rate of (0.37 ± 0.01) h -1 before nitrogen depletion and a reduced growth rate of (0.23 ± 0.005) h -1 after the nitrogen depletion and for the 0 g/L KNO3 cultures. These values align with the literature growth rates of nitrogen limited cultures ( 0.25 h -1 ) and unlimited cultures ( 0.37 h -1 ) (Joergensen & Degn, 1987). The reduced μ max of limited cultures suggests that nitrogen fixation is a limiting step in cell growth.\n\nThe end -point pH values differ significantly among the different KNO3 concentrations. Cultures with higher KNO3 concentration show an increase in pH from the initial value of 6.8 to 7.05. In contrast, cultures with lower KNO3 concentrations show a decreased pH, with lower values corresponding to lower KNO3 concentrations (Table 1).\n\nM. capsulatus produces a variety of organic acids, such as acetate, lactate, succinate, and formate (Jang et al., 2023; Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2013). The production of organic acids increases significantly after cell growth ceased (Lee, 2021). Lower nitrogen concentrations in the cultures might cause reduced pH values due to premature limited cell growth, leading to increased organic acid production. HPLC measurements verified organic acids production below 1 g/L, namely acetate, for all cultures. The organic acid accumulation could also be the cause for the declining transfer rates at the end of the cultivation. An additional effect is the consumption of KNO3 itself, which increases the pH upon metabolization, especially significant for the 1 g/L KNO3 cultures. These two effects increase the final pH for higher KNO3 concentrations and result in a lower pH for less KNO3 and higher organic acid concentrations.\n\nOverall, the data shows the capability of M. capsulatus to grow without nitrogen in the medium and the methane RAMOS can accurately monitor metabolic activities and limitations.

{"chunk": "[Section: 4 | CONCLUSION]\nThis study showcases the successful cultivation of methanotrophic organisms using the new methane RAMOS device. It enables the precise monitoring of all relevant transfer rates for methanotrophic cultivations, namely OTR, MTR, and CTR in up to eight shake flasks simultaneously. The insights generated by the transfer rates enhance the investigation of metabolic effects, limitations, and the influence of various cultivation parameters of methanotrophic organisms. The rapid and high -resolution response of the CH4 sensors ensures the accuracy of the MTR monitoring. Additionally, combining the closed gas balance and the GGTR evaluation with the monitored transfer rates improves the validation of the obtained rates.\n\nThe monitoring of transfer rates enables the online monitoring of the distinct stages of the process, including lag phases, growth, or depletions of secondary substrates. Throughout the cultivation processes, the RAMOS device can detect crucial gas transfer limitations as well. The observed O2 transfer limitations and subsequent decreases in MTR indicate an increase in biomass and a heightened demand for maintenance energy by the cultures. Ratios like the OQ and the CQ provide additional insights into the metabolic state of the cultures. This setup also facilitates the detection of nitrogen limitations, as well as demonstrates nitrogen fixation of inert N2 by M. capsulatus . A theoretical optimized nitrogen concentration in the medium could be estimated to improve biomass formation.\n\nIn summary, the setup described in this study not only enables the study of methanotrophic organisms but also streamlines the screening of various strains and experimental conditions. Its capacity to replicate conditions more akin to large -scale fermentations with constant gas flow, in contrast to traditional serum flasks, accelerates the optimization of media and processes. Additionally, the device's online monitoring reduces manual labor, enabling in -depth and precise analyses of up to eight parallel cultivations.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/223", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 306.879, "t": 339.0819995117188, "r": 549.702, "b": 201.9419995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/224", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 10, "bbox": {"l": 306.879, "t": 196.10399951171883, "r": 549.661, "b": 45.922999511718785, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/228", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 11, "bbox": {"l": 45.638, "t": 729.0729995117188, "r": 288.439, "b": 630.9389995117187, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "4 | CONCLUSION", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "This study showcases the successful cultivation of methanotrophic organisms using the new methane RAMOS device.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 111, "document_start": 44931, "document_end": 45042, "length": 111}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "It enables the precise monitoring of all relevant transfer rates for methanotrophic cultivations, namely OTR, MTR, and CTR in up to eight shake flasks simultaneously.", "char_start": 112, "char_end": 278, "document_start": 45043, "document_end": 45209, "length": 166}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "The insights generated by the transfer rates enhance the investigation of metabolic effects, limitations, and the influence of various cultivation parameters of methanotrophic organisms.", "char_start": 279, "char_end": 465, "document_start": 45210, "document_end": 45396, "length": 186}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "The rapid and high -resolution response of the CH4 sensors ensures the accuracy of the MTR monitoring.", "char_start": 466, "char_end": 568, "document_start": 45397, "document_end": 45499, "length": 102}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "Additionally, combining the closed gas balance and the GGTR evaluation with the monitored transfer rates improves the validation of the obtained rates.", "char_start": 569, "char_end": 722, "document_start": 45500, "document_end": 45653, "length": 151}, {"sentence_id": 5, "text": "The monitoring of transfer rates enables the online monitoring of the distinct stages of the process, including lag phases, growth, or depletions of secondary substrates.", "char_start": 722, "char_end": 892, "document_start": 45653, "document_end": 45823, "length": 170}, {"sentence_id": 6, "text": "Throughout the cultivation processes, the RAMOS device can detect crucial gas transfer limitations as well.", "char_start": 893, "char_end": 1000, "document_start": 45824, "document_end": 45931, "length": 107}, {"sentence_id": 7, "text": "The observed O2 transfer limitations and subsequent decreases in MTR indicate an increase in biomass and a heightened demand for maintenance energy by the cultures.", "char_start": 1001, "char_end": 1165, "document_start": 45932, "document_end": 46096, "length": 164}, {"sentence_id": 8, "text": "Ratios like the OQ and the CQ provide additional insights into the metabolic state of the cultures.", "char_start": 1166, "char_end": 1265, "document_start": 46097, "document_end": 46196, "length": 99}, {"sentence_id": 9, "text": "This setup also facilitates the detection of nitrogen limitations, as well as demonstrates nitrogen fixation of inert N2 by M. capsulatus .", "char_start": 1266, "char_end": 1405, "document_start": 46197, "document_end": 46336, "length": 139}, {"sentence_id": 10, "text": "A theoretical optimized nitrogen concentration in the medium could be estimated to improve biomass formation.", "char_start": 1406, "char_end": 1517, "document_start": 46337, "document_end": 46448, "length": 109}, {"sentence_id": 11, "text": "In summary, the setup described in this study not only enables the study of methanotrophic organisms but also streamlines the screening of various strains and experimental conditions.", "char_start": 1517, "char_end": 1700, "document_start": 46448, "document_end": 46631, "length": 183}, {"sentence_id": 12, "text": "Its capacity to replicate conditions more akin to large -scale fermentations with constant gas flow, in contrast to traditional serum flasks, accelerates the optimization of media and processes.", "char_start": 1701, "char_end": 1895, "document_start": 46632, "document_end": 46826, "length": 194}, {"sentence_id": 13, "text": "Additionally, the device's online monitoring reduces manual labor, enabling in -depth and precise analyses of up to eight parallel cultivations.", "char_start": 1896, "char_end": 2040, "document_start": 46827, "document_end": 46971, "length": 144}], "sentence_count": 14, "document_offsets": {"start": 44905, "end": 46971}}
