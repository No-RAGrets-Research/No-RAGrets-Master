Formic acid was derivatized with an excess of isopropanol under acidic conditions to its volatile isopropyl ester while methanol and ethanol remained unchanged. The entire sample preparation procedure is complete within 6 min. The design of the experiment (the face-centered central composite design) was used for finding the optimal conditions for derivatization, headspace sampling and chromatographic separation. The calibration dependences of the method were quadratic in the range from 50 to 5,000 mg / L, with adequate accuracy (89.0-114.4%) and precision ( < 12%) in the serum.

{"chunk": "[Section: Introduction — Part 1]\nMethanol poisoning is a relatively infrequent medical emergency and may result in significant morbidity and mortality if untreated and represents challenges for both clinicians and toxicological laboratories. Methanol is used as a solvent component of some antifreeze solutions, paints, gasoline additives and ethanol denaturants. However, most massive methanol poisonings (Argentina 1993, Norway 2002, Czech Republic 2012 and Libya 2013) were caused by the ingestion of adulterated alcoholic beverages (1-3).\n\nMethanol is a toxic substance and is metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and is then converted to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver. Formic acid is the principle toxic metabolite that can cause severe problems at high concentrations ( . 200 mg / L) and warrants hemodialysis treatment (4). Therefore, the initial stage of methanol intoxication is typically asymptomatic. During the later stage (6-12 h after ingestion), serious symptoms caused by methanol and formic acid can occur. The symptoms specific to high serum concentrations of formic acid include visual impairment, damage to the optical nerve, abdominal discomfort, nausea and headache. Without medical intervention, the high serum concentrations of formic acid can cause respiratory and renal failure, coma and eventually death. In the late phase, the diagnostic hallmark of methanol poisoning is the presence of a high anion gap, osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis. These indicators are unfortunately not specific and can be caused by other conditions, for instance diabetic ketoacidosis or multiple organ failure (5). Thus, measurement of serum methanol, and ideally formic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is required to differentiate the cause of the patient's condition.\n\nDespite the toxicity at elevated serum concentrations of formic acid, it is normally present in mammals due to the degradation of amino acids and external sources like the diet, alcoholic beverages or inhalation of methanol vapors. In previous studies, the serum formic acid concentration in living subjects has ranged up to 44 mg / L (6, 7).\n\nGas chromatography (GC) is a precise and reliable method for the determination of low-molecular weight alcohols in blood and other biological fluids and has become a reference method in forensic and clinical toxicology. Previously published methods employed different sample preparation techniques, including direct injection, static and dynamic headspace or headspace injection using solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) (8, 9). Headspace GC (HS-GC) is now the most widely used technique for the detection of volatile organic compounds in biological fluids, mainly for its ability to detect trace levels of volatiles without the need for complex sample preparation.\n\nFormic acid is commonly analyzed after derivatization with methanol to methyl formate or with ethanol to ethyl formate under acidic conditions (6, 8, 10). HS-GC or HS-SPME-GC are the methods of choice, although other variations of these techniques have been employed (7, 11). Enzymatic methods with colorimetric detection exhibit good selectivity, but the use of rather expensive reagents precludes their widespread application in clinical laboratories. Formate determination by capillary electrophoresis has been reported, but despite excellent separation efficiency and short separation times, this method is limited to the analysis of small ions only and is rarely used in clinical laboratory practice worldwide (12).\n\nUnfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate methods for simultaneous determination of methanol and formic acid. The simultaneous measurement of toxic formic acid along with parent methanol is clearly desirable for both enhanced clinical service and the correct diagnosis.\n\nThe goal of this work is simultaneous, simple and fast determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid in biological specimens by headspace GC with flame ionization detection. Previously published methods for the determination of formic acid were based on its derivatization with an excess of either methanol or ethanol, which prohibited the analysis of these alcohols along with formic acid in a single analytical procedure (6, 8). In our new method, derivatization of formic acid was achieved by using an excess of isopropanol, allowing for the simultaneous determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid. This approach is suitable for monitoring all the analyte concentrations in a single measurement during antidotal therapy (ethanol) or hemodialysis treatment.\n\nFurthermore, the complete sample preparation time is shortened to nearly 6 min. The quantitative serum results are available\n\nwithin 30 min (two serial measurements), which corresponds well with the usual emergency medicine turnaround time.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref":

The evaluated ranges of accuracy were from 89.0 to 114.4% in serum (Table II).\n\nThe human samples, serum and urine were spiked with a group of volatile organic substances (acetaldehyde, acetone, acetonitrile, 1-butanol, diethylether and ethyl acetate) to verify the selectivity of the new method. The mentioned analytes did not exhibit any interference with methanol, ethanol, formic acid or with internal standard (Supplementary data, Table S5). Moreover, two different parallel capillary columns (RTX-BAC 1 and RTX-BAC 2 Plus) with different stationary phases were used for confirmation of the selected analytes. The method was found to be selective enough to reliably differentiate and quantify methanol, ethanol and formic acid.\n\nThe analytical validation (selectivity, precision and accuracy) of the method was also performed for urine samples with satisfactory results (Supplementary data, Table S4).", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/51", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 42.52, "t": 184.8699995117188, "r": 397.702, "b": 178.50699951171873, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/52", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 309.486, "t": 722.8549995117188, "r": 558.458, "b": 637.7689995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/53", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 309.485, "t": 634.8709995117188, "r": 558.503, "b": 516.7339995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}, {"docling_ref": "#/texts/54", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 3, "bbox": {"l": 309.485, "t": 513.8359995117188, "r": 558.386, "b": 483.7399995117188, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "Table II", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "Within- and Between-Day Method Precision and Accuracy for Methanol, Ethanol and Formic Acid in Human Serum (6 Days, Six Replicates)\n\nconcentration range, with all the results being within the appropriate range of RSD 12% in serum.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 230, "document_start": 13226, "document_end": 13456, "length": 230}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "As proposed earlier, the acceptable RSD limit for middle and high concentrations was + 15%.", "char_start": 231, "char_end": 322, "document_start": 13457, "document_end": 13548, "length": 91}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "The accuracy was assessed as the percentage difference of the mean calculated concentration at each concentration level from the corresponding nominal concentration (16).", "char_start": 323, "char_end": 493, "document_start": 13549, "document_end": 13719, "length": 170}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "The evaluated ranges of accuracy were from 89.0 to 114.4% in serum (Table II).", "char_start": 494, "char_end": 574, "document_start": 13720, "document_end": 13800, "length": 78}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "The human samples, serum and urine were spiked with a group of volatile organic substances (acetaldehyde, acetone, acetonitrile, 1-butanol, diethylether and ethyl acetate) to verify the selectivity of the new method.", "char_start": 574, "char_end": 790, "document_start": 13800, "document_end": 14016, "length": 216}, {"sentence_id": 5, "text": "The mentioned analytes did not exhibit any interference with methanol, ethanol, formic acid or with internal standard (Supplementary data, Table S5).", "char_start": 791, "char_end": 940, "document_start": 14017, "document_end": 14166, "length": 149}, {"sentence_id": 6, "text": "Moreover, two different parallel capillary columns (RTX-BAC 1 and RTX-BAC 2 Plus) with different stationary phases were used for confirmation of the selected analytes.", "char_start": 941, "char_end": 1108, "document_start": 14167, "document_end": 14334, "length": 167}, {"sentence_id": 7, "text": "The method was found to be selective enough to reliably differentiate and quantify methanol, ethanol and formic acid.", "char_start": 1109, "char_end": 1228, "document_start": 14335, "document_end": 14454, "length": 117}, {"sentence_id": 8, "text": "The analytical validation (selectivity, precision and accuracy) of the method was also performed for urine samples with satisfactory results (Supplementary data, Table S4).", "char_start": 1228, "char_end": 1400, "document_start": 14454, "document_end": 14626, "length": 172}], "sentence_count": 9, "document_offsets": {"start": 13206, "end": 14626}}
