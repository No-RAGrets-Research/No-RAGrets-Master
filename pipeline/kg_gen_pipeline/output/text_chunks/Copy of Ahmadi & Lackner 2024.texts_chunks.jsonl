{"chunk": "[Section: Abstract]\nThe potential consequences for mankind could be disastrous due to global warming, which arises from an increase in the average temperature on Earth. The elevation in temperature primarily stems from the escalation in the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as   CO 2 ,   CH4, and   N 2 O within the atmosphere. Among these gases, methane   (CH 4 ) is particularly significant in driving alterations to the worldwide climate. Methanotrophic bacteria possess the distinctive ability to employ methane as both as source of carbon and energy. These bacteria show great potential as exceptional biocatalysts in advancing C1 bioconversion technology. The present review describes recent findings in methanotrophs including aerobic and anaerobic methanotroph bacteria, phenotypic characteristics, biotechnological potential, their physiology, ecology, and native multi-carbon utilizing pathways, and their molecular biology. The existing understanding of methanogenesis and methanotrophy in soil, as well as anaerobic methane oxidation and methanotrophy in temperate and extreme environments, is also covered in this discussion. New types of methanogens and communities of methanotrophic bacteria have been identified from various ecosystems and thoroughly examined for a range of biotechnological uses. Grasping the processes of methanogenesis and methanotrophy holds significant importance in the development of innovative agricultural techniques and industrial procedures that contribute to a more favorable equilibrium of GHG. This current review centers on the diversity of emerging methanogen and methanotroph species and their effects on the environment. By amalgamating advanced genetic analysis with ecological insights, this study pioneers a holistic approach to unraveling the biopotential of methanotrophs, offering unprecedented avenues for biotechnological applications.", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/6", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 1, "bbox": {"l": 51.022, "t": 550.760966796875, "r": 547.127, "b": 365.995966796875, "coord_origin": "BOTTOMLEFT"}}]}], "section": "Abstract", "sentences": [{"sentence_id": 0, "text": "The potential consequences for mankind could be disastrous due to global warming, which arises from an increase in the average temperature on Earth.", "char_start": 0, "char_end": 148, "document_start": 250, "document_end": 398, "length": 148}, {"sentence_id": 1, "text": "The elevation in temperature primarily stems from the escalation in the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as   CO 2 ,   CH4, and   N 2 O within the atmosphere.", "char_start": 149, "char_end": 319, "document_start": 399, "document_end": 569, "length": 170}, {"sentence_id": 2, "text": "Among these gases, methane   (CH 4 ) is particularly significant in driving alterations to the worldwide climate.", "char_start": 320, "char_end": 433, "document_start": 570, "document_end": 683, "length": 113}, {"sentence_id": 3, "text": "Methanotrophic bacteria possess the distinctive ability to employ methane as both as source of carbon and energy.", "char_start": 434, "char_end": 547, "document_start": 684, "document_end": 797, "length": 113}, {"sentence_id": 4, "text": "These bacteria show great potential as exceptional biocatalysts in advancing C1 bioconversion technology.", "char_start": 548, "char_end": 653, "document_start": 798, "document_end": 903, "length": 105}, {"sentence_id": 5, "text": "The present review describes recent findings in methanotrophs including aerobic and anaerobic methanotroph bacteria, phenotypic characteristics, biotechnological potential, their physiology, ecology, and native multi-carbon utilizing pathways, and their molecular biology.", "char_start": 654, "char_end": 926, "document_start": 904, "document_end": 1176, "length": 272}, {"sentence_id": 6, "text": "The existing understanding of methanogenesis and methanotrophy in soil, as well as anaerobic methane oxidation and methanotrophy in temperate and extreme environments, is also covered in this discussion.", "char_start": 927, "char_end": 1130, "document_start": 1177, "document_end": 1380, "length": 203}, {"sentence_id": 7, "text": "New types of methanogens and communities of methanotrophic bacteria have been identified from various ecosystems and thoroughly examined for a range of biotechnological uses.", "char_start": 1131, "char_end": 1305, "document_start": 1381, "document_end": 1555, "length": 174}, {"sentence_id": 8, "text": "Grasping the processes of methanogenesis and methanotrophy holds significant importance in the development of innovative agricultural techniques and industrial procedures that contribute to a more favorable equilibrium of GHG.", "char_start": 1306, "char_end": 1532, "document_start": 1556, "document_end": 1782, "length": 226}, {"sentence_id": 9, "text": "This current review centers on the diversity of emerging methanogen and methanotroph species and their effects on the environment.", "char_start": 1533, "char_end": 1663, "document_start": 1783, "document_end": 1913, "length": 130}, {"sentence_id": 10, "text": "By amalgamating advanced genetic analysis with ecological insights, this study pioneers a holistic approach to unraveling the biopotential of methanotrophs, offering unprecedented avenues for biotechnological applications.", "char_start": 1664, "char_end": 1886, "document_start": 1914, "document_end": 2136, "length": 222}], "sentence_count": 11, "document_offsets": {"start": 230, "end": 2136}}

{"chunk": "[Section: Introduction]\nGlobal  warming  and  initiation  of  ice  ages  are  still  a serious scientific problem (Supran et al. 2023). It seems that the global warming debate is increasing following the\n\npublication of Cheng et al. (2022) which was emphasized on imbalance evidence of human influence on climate. This leads to considerable controversy among different environmental and atmospheric scientists, as evidenced in several previous publications (Lackner 2015; Harvey et al. 2023; Jansson and Wu 2023). These publications and reports questioned the relationship between the increasing concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) and the earth surface temperature.\n\nIt is reported that the atmospheric   CO 2 concentration was reached to 420 μmol   mol -1 in  2022  (Le  and  Lee 2022) which was increased by 51% and is responsible for 16% of the greenhouse effect (Jang et al. 2023). It is demonstrated that the atmospheric   CO 2 concentration is an important factor in global warming and climate change\n\nCH4\n\nCylCred\n\n02.\n\nNADH+H*\n\n02.\n\nSMMO\n\nTYPE I METHANOTROPHS\n\n(Giunta et al. 2022). However, methane   (CH 4 ) is a serious GHG that is 28 to 34 folds stronger than   CO 2 in increasing global warming potential and climate change during the time (Wang et al. 2022). Le and Lee (2022) reported that the global atmospheric   CH 4 concentration is increasing by 166% higher than the preindustrial level. Sadeh et al. (2023) reported that the   CH 4 atmospheric concentration increased at a rate of 0.003 μmol   mol -1 year -1 .\n\nGHG cycling is complex and several biological and anthropogenic  processes  are  involved  (Lackner  et  al. 2021; Han et al. 2023). The most important anthropogenic activities are agriculture, fossil fuels, and biofuel burning, energy, waste, and industrial production (Chew et al. 2023). Previous research (Bartosiewicz et al. 2023) reported that waste, energy, industry, and agriculture contribute 20.61%, 28.65%, 0.10%, and 50.63% of the calculated annual   CH 4 emission, respectively. The main biological source of atmospheric   CH 4 in anoxic environments is produced by methanogens bacteria (Sadeh et al. 2023). The effect of reduction of   CH 4 in reducing the global warming is 20 to 60 times more than   CO 2 emissions (Sadeh et al. 2023). So, finding a solution way to reduce the atmospheric   CH 4 is so critical.\n\nMethanotrophs or methane-oxidizing bacteria (MOB) have the unique ability to use   CH 4 as their sole carbon and energy source (Cheng et al. 2022). In this comprehensive review, we will focus on methanotroph bacteria, their taxonomy, physiology, diversity, ecology and distribution, associations  of  methanotrophs  with  other  bacteria, biodegradation of toxic chemicals by methanotrophic bacteria, anaerobic methane oxidation mechanism, and factors affecting their function all based on the recent new findings and research all over the world.\n\nIn  this  comprehensive  review,  we  addressed  most recent findings in methanotrophs, including aerobic and anaerobic methanotrophs, taxonomy, diversity, genetics, molecular ecology, and their biochemical potential all based on the recent new findings and research all over the  world.  Although  there  are  some  previous  reports on  methanotrophs,  however,  this  ground-breaking comprehensive  review  unveils  a  multitude  of  recent discoveries  in  the  realm  of  methanotrophs,  ranging from their intricate genetics to the dynamic landscape of  molecular  ecology.  With  a  focus  on  recent  genetic revelations,  molecular  intricacies,  and  untapped biopotential, this research introduces a novel chapter in methanotrophic studies, underscoring its contribution to both fundamental knowledge and practical applications.

{"chunk": "[Section: Methanotrophic bacteria, aerobic, and anaerobic — Part 1]\nMethanotrophic  bacteria  are  a  subgroup  of  so-called methylotrophic bacteria (methylotrophs), and they can utilize methane as their sole carbon and energy source (while the latter metabolize methanol). Methanotrophs can  catalyze  the  oxidation  of  methane  to  methanol  by using methane monooxygenases (MMOs) enzyme (Rhee et  al.  2019;  Lackner et al. 2022). It is well known that the  aerobic  methanotrophs  are  Gram-negative  bacteria and  with  a  total  of  23  genera  and  roughly  60  species being identified (Guerrero-Cruz et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2023a). There are different types of aerobic methanotrophs known as Gammaproteobacteria, type I,  with  families Methylococcaceae and Methylothermaceae ,   and Alphaproteobacteria, type II, with families Methylocystaceae and Beijerinckiaceae (Guerrero-Cruz et al. 2021).\n\nThe metabolism and unique pathways of methanotroph bacteria including an important role of formaldehyde as an intermediate in catabolism and anabolism are shown in Fig. 1 (Hanson and Hanson 1996). There is another pathway (dihydroxyacetone) in yeast strains which is growth on methanol and leads to formaldehyde assimilation. Then, carbon assimilation will be occurred after oxidation steps (Giunta et al. 2022).\n\nThe anaerobic methanotrophs were found in the marine sediments for the first time where sulfate is present and is involved in methane consumption (Kalyuzhnaya et al. 2019). Sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) are responsible for sulfatedependent anaerobic methane oxidation process in anaerobic conditions (Yu et al. 2022) (Fig. 2). However, it is reported that nitrite   (NO 2 -) and nitrate   (NO 3 -) are more abundant than sulfate   (SO 4 2) in freshwater environments and can\n\nCH4\n\nCO2\n\n8e -\n\nAQH 2DS\n\nAQDS\n\nSO4 2-\n\nHS -\n\nCH4\n\nCO2\n\nAQDS\n\nS0\n\nHS2 -\n\nSO4 2-\n\nSO4 2-\n\nAQH 2DS\n\nHS -\n\nAQDS\n\n(A)\n\n(B)\n\ninvolve in microbial processes of methane oxidation (Malyan et al. 2021). Equation 1 summarizes the sulfate reduction\n\nSubsequently,  SRB  mediate  the  transformation  of  zerovalent  sulfur, a by-product of ANME, into various compounds. This scenario suggests  a  concealed  sulfur  cycle  where  AQDS  and  sulfide  chemically react  to  regenerate  zero-valent  sulfur.  ANME's  metabolic  activity intensifies due to the availability of these two electron acceptors. Our research findings align with the extracellular electron transfer concept depicted in scenario A ,  rather than the active sulfate respiration and sulfur disproportionation model shown in scenario B (Yu et al. 2022)\n\ninvolved in anaerobic methane oxidation processes (Siniscalchi et al. 2022):\n\nThe co-occurrence of anaerobic methanotrophic archaea and Deltaproteobacteria was reported in sulfate-reducing enrichment environments, and it is probably in a syntrophic manner (Siniscalchi et al. 2022); they both have an extremely low energy yield of the net reaction (Eq. 1). However, the biological nature of sulfate reduction bacteria is complex and is a geomicrobiological puzzle.\n\nSeveral documents demonstrated the effective role of nitrate/nitrite reduction in methane oxidation that is critical to processes of GHG emission (Baba and Miyaji 2020; Farhan Ul Haque et al. 2020; Hwang and Lee 2023). Recent findings in molecular biology techniques could successfully determine the important role of nitrate/nitrite reduction bacteria and archaea in methane oxidation (N-AOM processes) (Le and Lee 2023). In this context, novel biological 16S rRNA and gene amplicon analysis demonstrated that Methylomirabilis - and Methanoperedens -like microorganisms are more widespread than previously believed (Hopple et al. 2022). Meanwhile, there are new evidence that novel Candidatus Methylomirabilis sinica and Candidatus Methylomirabilis lanthanidiphila can support the N-AOM process (Hwang and Lee 2023; Bhattarai et al. 2019). Presence of M. nitroreducens and M. oxyfera require the controlled environmental conditions because of their slow growth rate of these bacteria (Wang et al. 2022).\n\nIsotopic evidence demonstrated the important role of M. nitroreducens as a N-AOM using nitrate as electron acceptor (Le et al. 2021). As shown in Fig. 3, methanogenesis is a biological process that consumes   CH 4 and produces   CO 2 and   H 2 using methyl coenzyme M reductase (MCR). It is recognized that some new genes are involved in MCR synthesis such as mcrABCDG genes in M. nitroreducens. So, mcrA can be used as an important biomarker to identify methanotrophic bacteria in different cultures (Chan and Lee 2019). The nitrate reductase genes and reverse methanogenesis were recognized in the genome of M. nitroreducens , whereas no enzymes were reported for the subsequent denitrification. So, some anaerobic methanotrophic archaea can reduce   NO 3 -to   NO 2 -and must rely on a partner to further reduce   NO 2 -to   N 2 (Muñoz-Gómez et al. 2022).", "provenance": [{"docling_ref":

{"chunk": "[Section: Taxonomy of methanotrophic bacteria]\nChallenges encountered in the pursuit of obtaining pure cultures, understanding phenotypic traits, and adhering to the guidelines outlined in the International Code of Nomenclature of Bacteria (Oren 2020) have given rise to limitations in the classification of methanotrophs. Over the past five decades, a considerable number of methanotrophic cultures have been successfully isolated and formally characterized, beginning with the seminal work of Whittenbury. Presently, our understanding encompasses 18 clusters of aerobic methanotrophic bacteria within the Gammaproteobacteria class and an additional five clusters within the Alphaproteobacteria class, constituting a diverse spectrum of approximately 60 distinct species.\n\nMethanotrophic organisms with formally recognized names are classified into two distinct classes, namely, the Gammaproteobacteria (also referred to as type I and type X) and Alphaproteobacteria (also referred to as type II) classes (Muñoz-Gómez et al. 2022). Gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs are categorized within the Methylococcales order\n\nOuter membrane reductase),  MER  (methylene  H4MPT reductase),  MTD (methyleneH4MPT dehydrogenase), MTR (methyl-H4MPT:coenzyme M methyltransferase), NAR  (nitrate reductase), and NRF (nitrite reductase  ammonium-forming).  Within  this  context,  CoA,  CoB, and  CoM  represent  coenzymes  A,  B,  and  M,  respectively.  H4MPT corresponds to tetrahydromethanopterin, and MFR signifies methanofuran (Costa et al. 2022)\n\nand encompass three families: Methylococcaceae , Methylothermaceae , and Crenotrichaceae . This group presently encompasses 42 species with officially published names distributed across 19 genera (Le et al. 2021). The Methylothermaceae family encompasses two genera and two species, while the Crenotrichaceae family comprises a single genus and species (Nguyen and Lee 2021). These taxonomic assignments are primarily founded on the phylogenetic analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences (Cheng et al. 2022). A summary of discernible characteristics displayed by species within Methylomicrobium , Methylotuvimicrobium gen. nov., and Methylosarcina can be found in Table 2.\n\nCategory I methanotrophs have been classified into three distinct groups. The initial group, comprising phenotypes 1 to 3, is represented by the species Methylomonas methanica , Methylomonas fodinamm , and Methylomonas aurantiaca , which are characterized by the presence of pink and orange carotenoid pigments. These species share common attributes, including encapsulated cells with a coccobacillary or rod-shaped morphology, the presence of poly-P-hydroxybutyrate inclusions, non-desiccation resistant cysts, carotenoid\n\nMTR\n\nHDR\n\n- CH-S-CoM+\n\n* CН3-H,MPT\n\nF 420\n\nF 420-H2\n\nMER\n\nVRA\n\nCH4\n\npigments, and motility facilitated by a single polar flagellum. Additional distinguishing phenotypic traits for these species are outlined in detail in Table 3.\n\nType II methanotrophs pertain to the Alphaproteobacteria class and encompass representatives from the Methylocystaceae and Beijerinckiaceae families. Within the type II methanotrophs, there are closely affiliated clusters present in the validated species within the Methylocystis and\n\nMethylosinus genera. Specific characteristics that differentiate the genera of type II methanotrophs are outlined in Table 4. On the other hand, type I methanotrophs are categorized as the 'high capacity' group, primarily inhabiting environments abundant in methane but lacking in oxygen. Conversely, the 'low capacity' type II methanotrophs prevail in environments with scant methane and ample oxygen. This distinction implies that varying types of methanotrophs\n\nmay partake in methane oxidation under diverse moisture conditions, as highlighted by Zhou et al.

{"chunk": "[Section: Biotechnological potential of methanotrophs — Part 1]\nMethanotrophs, found widespread, offer potential for remediating contaminated sites. A research has demonstrated that introducing methane can enhance the aerobic breakdown of halogenated hydrocarbons, as discussed in the review by Le et al. (2021). Both variants of the MMO can convert these halogenated compounds. However, the available data suggests that despite its slower degradation rate, the particulate\n\nMMO (pMMO) ultimately proves to be the more efficient system. Considering this, the utilization of adaptable Methylocystis strains becomes appealing. Within these strains, the pMMO is activated in the presence of acetate or ethanol, as observed in studies by Khanongnuch et al. (2022). This approach could be employed to provide the necessary reducing agents for the MMO. Such a strategy would be more feasible to implement in polluted sites compared to methane introduction and would additionally prevent competition for binding to the monooxygenase enzyme.\n\nAs another example of bioremediation, Methylocella was among the bacteria associated with degradation of plastics in landfill lysimeters (Khanongnuch et al. 2022). Obligate methanotrophs such as Methylococcus capsulatus , which can\n\nAll these organisms are characterized as gram-negative, strictly aerobic, and obligate methylotrophs. They utilize the serine pathway to assimilate formaldehyde. Notably, they possess intracytoplasmic membranes that are oriented parallel to the cell wall. Their growth is not supported at a temperature of 458 °C. These microorganisms possess a complete tricarboxylic acid cycle but lack the enzymes associated with the Calvin-Benson cycle. Additionally, they engage in nitrogen fixation through an aerotolerant nitrogenase system. The prominent phospholipid fatty acid is 18:1v8c, and their DNA base compositions exhibit a range of 62 to 67 mol% G1C (Whiddon et al. 2019; Le et al. 2021)\n\ngrow relatively quickly and to high cell densities, have been exploited for production of single-cell protein (Khanongnuch et al. 2022). While Methylocella , which exhibits slower grow, may not be as useful to produce low value, bulk chemicals, it can still be grown to high cell densities in fermenter culture (Priyadarsini et al. 2023). Its metabolic versatility warrants further examination in this respect. Large-scale production of methanol from methane is an attractive proposition and promising results have been obtained in several studies (Baba and Miyaji 2020). As an illustration, combinations of Methylomonas methanica and Methylocella tundra co-cultures, which were encapsulated within silica gel, were supplied with simulated biogas as a nutrient source.\n\nIt  is  worth  noting  that  the  introduction  of  hydrogen resulted in a significant enhancement in methanol production, nearly doubling it to approximately 0.32 g   l -1 , with a corresponding 66% conversion efficiency (Zhou et al. 2020). However, a notable challenge in utilizing the MMO for methanol production lies in the need for a costly electron donor, such as formate, to facilitate methane oxidation. Nonetheless, a promising solution may be found in facultative methanotrophs, as they possess the capability to utilize compounds like acetate, which are commonly found in waste streams, as an alternative electron donor (Lee et al. 2023).\n\nWhile Methylocella spp. exhibit a wider array of metabolic capabilities compared to obligatory methanotrophs, their potential biocatalytic applications have not been fully explored. The soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) has traditionally been recognized as an exceptionally versatile biocatalyst, facilitating the oxidation of a diverse spectrum of compounds, including alkanes, alkenes, and even relatively large aromatics like naphthalene (Priyadarsini et al. 2023).\n\nThe utilization of intact cells of methanotrophs like Methylococcus capsulatus for the production of chemicals such as propylene oxide (from propylene) is a viable approach.

{"chunk": "[Section: Oxidation of formaldehyde and formate]\nThe majority of the necessary reducing potential required for methane metabolism is generated through a series of steps involving the oxidation of formaldehyde, progressing through formate, and ultimately leading to the production of carbon dioxide. Within methylotrophs, there are multiple enzyme systems responsible for the oxidation of formaldehyde to formate (Rozova et al. 2021). These systems encompass NAD (P)-linked aldehyde dehydrogenases, which may or may not necessitate reduced glutathione or\n\nother cofactors, as well as dye-linked dehydrogenases, which are quantified through the reduction of dyes like 2,6-dichlorophenol, (Singh et al. 2023).\n\nThe conversion of formate to carbon dioxide is facilitated by an NAD-dependent formate dehydrogenase in most, if not all, methanotrophs (Schmitz et al. 2022). Some methylotrophs that employ the RuMP pathway for formaldehyde assimilation utilize a cyclic pathway for  the  oxidation  of  formaldehyde  to  carbon  dioxide (Cruz and Pijuan 2022). In this pathway, formaldehyde and ribulose-5-phosphate engage in a reaction, yielding hexulose-6-phosphate, which is subsequently isomerized to  fructose-6-phosphate, eventually transforming into glucose-6-phosphate. This glucose-6-phosphate undergoes further oxidation to yield 6-phosphogluconate.

{"chunk": "[Section: Methanol oxidation]\nMethanol, originating from both endogenous sources (resulting from methane oxidation via MMO) and exogenous sources (such as pectin and lignin degradation), undergoes oxidation to formaldehyde via a periplasmic methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) in gram-negative methylotrophs (Le and Lee 2023). MDH exists as an α 2 β2 tetramer, composed of large (60 to 67 kDa) and small (8.5 kDa) subunits (Le and Lee 2022). This enzyme is classified as a quinoprotein, with each tetramer containing 2 moles of pyrroloquinoline quinone and 1 mole of calcium (Zhu et al. 2022). The transfer of electrons from MDH to cytochrome c L , an atypical cytochrome serving as the specific electron acceptor for MDH, is the subsequent step (Tikhonova et al. 2023). Cytochrome c L ,  in  turn,  is  oxidized by a typical class I cytochrome c (cytochrome c H ), which is also specific for methanol oxidation (Kang-Yun et al. 2022). Importantly, all three components-MDH, cytochrome c L , and cytochrome c H -are soluble and reside within the periplasm of gramnegative methylotrophs (Tentori et al. 2022). In contrast, gram-positive methylotrophs employ an NAD-linked MDH for methanol oxidation, while methanol-oxidizing yeast species use a methanol oxidase system for the same purpose. Notably, these enzymes have not been detected in gramnegative methanotrophic bacteria (Priyadarsini et al. 2023).\n\nThe regulation of MDH (malate dehydrogenase) synthesis involves complex regulatory networks in facultative methylotrophs and is at least present in one methanotrophic organism.

{"chunk": "[Section: Findings on ecology and distribution of methanotrophic bacteria: 16S RRNA and functional genes]\nThe  most  common  habitats  for  methanotroph  bacteria is shown in Fig. 4. Nearly all samples taken from muds, swamps, rivers, rice paddies, oceans, ponds, soils from meadows, deciduous woods, streams, sewage sludge, and several other environments contained methanotrophic bacteria (Oudova-Rivera et al. 2023). Estimations of methane emissions from wastewater treatment are scarce and accurate determinations are limited (Moore et al. 2023) (in detail in 'Underestimation of Sector-Wide Methane Emissions from United States Wastewater Treatment'). When employing viable-count methods, the quantities of methanotrophs identified in soils, sediments, and aquatic environments spanned\n\n• marine\n\n• marine sediment\n\n• marine volcanic from 103 to 106 cells per gram (Zhou et al. 2020). Peltokangas et al. (2023) reported that significant amounts of   CH 4 were produced even after homogenization of soil samples, where the anoxic microsites were destroyed. This has led to some authors to hypothesize that methanogens are not the sole source of   CH 4 in oxic soils, but the possibility of nonmicrobial   CH 4 formation in soils must be considered (Galera et al. 2023). Lin et al. (2023) conducted an experiment in which   CH 4 release from soil increased with increasing temperature and organic C content, and with the addition of water to dried soils. Certain temperatures examined, reaching as high as 70 °C, exceeded the established enzymatic activity range of methanogens, effectively ruling out the likelihood of microbial methane   (CH 4 ) production. This implies the presence of an unidentified chemical mechanism generating   CH 4 in oxygen-rich soil environments. Notably, there has been recent documentation of the abiotic creation of   CH 4 under extremely oxidizing conditions, and this phenomenon could have significance within soil ecosystems (Hopple et al. 2022).\n\nIqbal et al. (2023) highlighted the significance of rice paddies as a substantial source of atmospheric methane (CH4), contributing to approximately 10% of total anthropogenic   CH 4 emissions. In freshwater lakes, it is commonly assumed that high methane oxidation activity occurs at the\n\noxic-anoxic transition zones (Bashir et al. 2023). An analysis of sediment microbial communities, based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, revealed the presence of diverse groups of aerobic methanotrophs, including type I gamma- and type II alpha-proteobacterial MOB (Wang et al. 2023b). Within the Methylococcaceae family, varying proportions were observed, ranging from 0.07 to 0.23% of the total, with the highest occurrence at a depth of 3 cm. In contrast, type II alpha-MOB Methylocystis was found at much lower relative abundances, peaking at 0.01% at a depth of 6 cm (Kaise et al. 2023).\n\nlevels (IPCC 2013).

{"chunk": "[Section: Findings on the native multi-carbon utilizing pathways in methanotrophic bacteria — Part 1]\nIt is noted that approximately 50-65% of total methane emissions are attributed to anthropogenic activities, encompassing ruminant husbandry, fossil fuel extraction and usage, rice paddy agriculture, and emissions from landfills and waste. This has led to a current atmospheric methane concentration increase of 2.5 times compared to preindustrial\n\nIn methanotrophic bacteria, both sMMO and pMMO can catalyze the hydroxylation of different alkanes. pMMO can only oxidize C1-C5 alkanes, in contrast to sMMO, which has a much wider substrate range (Chan and Lee 2019).

Additionally, a relatively small cavity in the active site restricts the substrate specificity of pMMO and leads to preferential oxidation of the substrate (R)-alcohols (Pham et al. 2023). In contrast to the comprehensive exploration of methane (C1) metabolism, the breakdown of gaseous alkanes ranging from C2 to C5 among methanotrophs has received limited attention (as depicted in Fig. 5). A noteworthy case lies with the type II methanotroph, Methylocella silvestris , which exhibits the capability to utilize both methane and propane as sources of carbon and energy. This distinct trait marks M. silvestris as the initial methanotroph known to utilize a short-chain alkane instead of methane. Furthermore, M. silvestris is equipped to metabolize ethane through oxidation processes.\n\nThe presence of isocitrate lyase and malate synthase explains its ability to thrive on ethane and its metabolic intermediates ethanol and acetate (Bordel et al. 2019). In addition to ethane assimilation, propane assimilation pathways have also been observed in M. silvestris (Bordel et al. 2019) and Methylacidiphilum sp. IT6 (Awala et al. 2021). Two additional pathways are involved in the degradation of propane: the first converts propane into 1-propanol and then methylmalonyl -CoA, whereas the second converts propane into 2-propanol, which is subsequently oxidized to acetone, acetol, and lactate, which can be further converted into pyruvate by putative lactate dehydrogenase (Fig. 5) (Le and Lee 2023).\n\nWhile  cultivating M.  silvestris on  propane,  it  was observed that both 2-propanol and acetone accumulated in the culture medium. This suggests that the transformation of acetone into acetol could be hindered by kinetic barriers. Intriguingly, during the growth of 2-propanol in Methylacidiphilum sp. IT6, a gene cluster responsible for the conversion of 2-propanol to pyruvate via acetol exhibited increased expression. Notably, this cluster encompasses one of the three genomic operons related to pmoA, which generates pMMO. Interestingly, the encoded enzyme PMO3 within this cluster facilities oxidation of acetone to acetol as reported by Awala et al. (2021).\n\nIn  conclusion,  these  discoveries  shed  light  on  the adaptable metabolic capacities of facultative methanotrophs, showcasing their ability to utilize a wide range of substrates.

{"chunk": "[Section: Findings on the native multi-carbon utilizing pathways in methanotrophic bacteria — Part 2]\nThe understanding of methane oxidation mechanisms and the rational engineering of metabolic processes have been challenging due to the exclusive reliance on methane and methanol as carbon and energy sources by obligate gammaproteobacterial methanotrophs. To address the gaps in our foundational comprehension of C1 metabolism and to enhance methanotrophic capabilities for methane conversion, a potential strategy involves merging methanotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic pathways through the construction of synthetic multi-carbon utilization pathways.

{"chunk": "[Section: Glucose utilizing pathway]\nThe enzyme responsible for phosphorylating glucose, ATPglucokinase ( glk ), has been identified in type I methanotrophs (Zhou et al. 2020). Notably, there are no known methanotrophs capable of utilizing glucose as a carbon source for their growth. Moreover, genome analysis has revealed that some type I methanotrophs may harbor putative gluconate kinase ( GntK ) and glucose-1-dehydrogenase ( gdh ) enzymes, the functions of which remain currently unknown (Rozova et al. 2021). Both gluconate kinase and glucose dehydrogenase could potentially have associations with the EntnerDoudoroff pathway, glycolysis, and the oxidative PPP (Tyne et al. 2023). Double mutants ( gdh─/glk─) or ( gntk─/glk─) exhibited distinct phenotypes compared to the wild-type strain of Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum when grown on methane. These mutants displayed higher accumulations of glucose-trehalose and lower glycogen storage (Rozova et al. 2021). Despite the presence of redundant sugar metabolism pathways in obligate methanotrophs, the precise reasons for their inability to utilize glucose as a carbon and energy source for growth remain unclear. An intriguing observation is the absence of a phosphotransferase system for glucose transport in type I methanotrophs, which may hinder the uptake of glucose from the surrounding medium into the cells.\n\nRemarkably, Pham et al.

{"chunk": "[Section: Molecular biology of sMMO and pMMO]\nThe genes responsible for encoding sMMO from various methanotrophic organisms have been successfully cloned and sequenced. The most extensively studied are those from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (Hwang and Lee 2023). sMMO genes are organized in clusters on the chromosomes of these\n\nB\n\nmmoX\n\nmmoY\n\n60 kDa\n\nттоВ\n\nProtein B\n\n45 KDa pmoC\n\nPmoC\n\n23 kDa mmoC\n\n?\n\nReductase\n\n39 kDa\n\n1 kb\n\npmoB\n\nPmoB\n\n45 kDa\n\nmethanotrophic organisms (as shown in Fig. 7A,B). Specifically, within this cluster, mmoX , mmoY , and mmoZ are responsible for encoding the α-, β-, and γ-subunits, respectively, of the hydroxylase. Additionally, mmoB and mmoC are the genes that encode protein B and the reductase component, respectively.\n\nInterestingly, mmoB lies between mmoY and mmoZ ; an ORF of unknown function, designated orfY , with a coding capacity of 12 kDa, lies between mmoZ and mmoC in all genes clusters analyzed to date (Guo et al. 2022). The genes responsible for coding sMMO exhibit a high degree of conservation across all studied methanotrophic genera. The nucleotide sequences of these genes share identities ranging from 55 to 94%, while the corresponding amino acid sequences exhibit similarities ranging from 47 to 96%.\n\nquestions about their functional significance. In the case of Nitrosomonas europaea , for example, the reasons for having multiple copies of the amoA gene are not yet fully understood. An interesting observation is that when an insertion mutant with a deficiency in one copy of the amoA gene was created, it exhibited slower growth compared to the wildtype strain. Surprisingly, a mutant with a defect in the second copy of the amoA gene showed normal growth. This suggests that while some copies of the gene might be essential for optimal growth, others could be dispensable or have redundant functions.\n\nThe genes encoding pMMO from Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) have been cloned and sequenced (Dawson et al. 2023) and are clustered on the chromosome in the order pmoCAB (Fig. 7B). There are two virtually identical copies of these genes (13 bp changes over 3183 bp of pmoCAB ) present in the genome of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) and a third copy of pmoC has also been identified (Bo et al. 2023). This is very similar to the analogous system in nitrifiers that also contain two copies of genes encoding ammonia monooxygenase, amoCAB , and a third amoC gene (Eltayb et al. 2023).\n\nComparison of pmo and amo genes from methanotrophs and nitrifiers suggests that the pMMO and AMO may be evolutionarily related (Samanta et al. 2022). The presence of multiple copies of these genes in such bacteria raises\n\nSingh et al. (2023) successfully developed chromosomal insertion mutants in all seven pmo genes found in Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath). Interestingly, except for the singular third copy of the pmoC gene, which did not yield any null mutants, the mutants from the other genes displayed growth when supplied with methane. This suggests a functional equivalence between the two sets of genes. Specifically, the mutants related to the first copy demonstrated approximately two-thirds of the methane oxidation activity seen in the wildtype strain, while the mutants related to the second copy exhibited roughly one-third of the activity observed in the wild-type strain. No double null mutants defective in both copies of pmoCAB were obtained which suggests that the cells require pMMO for normal growth (Zhu et al. 2022).\n\nThe complete pMMO gene clusters from two additional methanotrophic genera, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b and Methylocystis sp. strain M, have been recently cloned and sequenced. Similar to other studied methanotrophs, they also possess two copies of the pmoCAB genes (as outlined\n\n16 kDa pmoA\n\nPmoA\n\n26 kDa mmoZ\n\n20 KDa orfy\n\n1 kb\n\nin Antony et al. 2023). Comparative examination of the derived polypeptide sequences of pMMO and AMO (ammonia monooxygenase) underscores the resemblances between these two enzyme systems and highlights the conserved nature of their sequences. These sequences exhibit identities ranging from 42 to 87% and similarities spanning from 58 to 95% at the amino acid level. PmoC and PmoA are anticipated to be highly hydrophobic, consisting primarily of putative transmembrane-spanning helices, while PmoB contains only two presumed transmembrane regions. The extensive dataset of pMMO gene sequences from various methanotrophs offers the opportunity to utilize pmo as a 'functional gene probe' in molecular ecology studies, enabling investigations into the diversity of methanotrophs within natural environments. This utilization has been recently explored and reviewed in publications such as Tentori et al. (2022) and Tyne et al. (2023).", "provenance": [{"docling_ref": "#/texts/245", "label": "text", "pages": [{"page_no": 15, "bbox": {"l": 306.142, "t": 145.60996679687503, "r": 546.86, "b": 73.34496679687504, "coord_origin":

{"chunk": "[Section: Research needs and future direction]\nCurrently, no bacterial strain has demonstrated efficient methane assimilation for both cell growth and chemical production. The challenge lies in achieving stable folding of MMO, with the primary obstacle being the control of DNA-protein crosslinking by formaldehyde during methanol oxidation (Cheng et al. 2022). The development of robust synthetic methanotrophs for targeted product production demands significant efforts in engineering techniques and the study of evolutionary mechanisms, as emphasized by Whiddon et al. (2019). To enhance the efficiency of pMMO in different organisms for methane incorporation, it is crucial to understand its native environment and the specific sites where methane binds. These insights would bridge a substantial knowledge gap for researchers.\n\nDespite recent advancements in methanogenesis and methanotrophy research, particularly the importance of soils like paddy soils in the methane cycle, further exploration is essential to deepen our understanding of these mechanisms and develop innovative eco-friendly methods. Additionally, a more comprehensive grasp of the contributions of various ecosystems to the global methane balance is needed. Several research areas warrant further investigation, including extensive field studies in rice paddies, exploration of novel methane production processes in aerobic conditions (such as non-microbial methanogenic chemical processes and methane production by terrestrial plants), utilization of advanced molecular biology techniques to study high-affinity methanotrophs, and comprehension of anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM).
