The values of E, for free and immobilized cells were  computed to be  19,537 and  14,800 cal/mol, respectively. The synthesis of  methanol by  immobilized cells was at a constant rate of  8.75  pmol/h  mg cells for the first 2.5 h (Fig. 4), and the rate fell sharply after 6 h. In our earlier studies with  free cells, the fall in  the methanol accumulation  rate  was  attributed  to  depletion  of  the endogenous NADHz pool, and methanol accumulation rate was maximally stimulated by supplying 40 mM formate to the  reaction ves~e1.I~ With  immobilized cells, maximum stimulation in methanol accumulation rate to 8.6  ,umol/h  mg  cells occurred  on  addition  of  40  mM\n\n2.4\n\n2.0-\n\nh\n\nc\n\nE\n\n1.6-\n\nE\n\n3\n\n1.2\n\nE\n\na\n\n--.

While  the pH  and  temperature optima remain the same between free and immobilized  cells,  higher  phosphate  ion  concentration (100 mM) is required for maximum methanol biosynthesis  in  immobilized cells. In batch and continuous studies, the rate of methanol accumulation falls low after a certain initial period due to depletion of  the intracellular NADH2 pool. Both phosphate ions and duration of   supply of  formate affect methanol biosynthesis in the continuous reactor.",
