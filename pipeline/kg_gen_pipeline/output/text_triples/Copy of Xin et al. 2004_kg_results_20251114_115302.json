For long-term maintenance of methanol synthesis, methane was selected as a substrate for regeneration of reducing equivalent. By alternate reaction and regeneration, the results show that resting cell of M. trichosporium IMV 3011 can be used for many times to catalyze the reduction of carbon dioxide, in which the origin of the reducing equivalent is methane. It is possible to theoretically deduce that the overall reaction for methanol synthesis can be completed by biocatalysis using greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane) as raw materials without adding hydrogen.

Methanol can be produced chemically via methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etcll-s) Synthesis of methanol from carbon dioxide has several obvious advantages. For example, carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases, which have been theorized to contribute to global warming. However, the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol is fundamentally difficult to achieve under mild condition in chemical catalysis. Conventional methods for synthesizing methanol from CO, suffer from certain drawbacks such as inefficiencies, costs, high energy consumption and the need for special equipment adapted for high temperature or highly corrosive environments. Enzymatically coupled sequential reduction of CO, to methanol, using a series of reaction catalyzed by three different dehydrogenases, particularly appealing. Accordingly, a new technique for conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol that alleviates such drawbacks is desired.",

Unfortunately, up to now, there are no known organisms whose normal biological role is reduction of CO, to methanol. In these organisms, methane is oxidized via methanol, formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide formaldehyde incorporated into cell biomass. The CO, produced from methane oxidation is partly emitted and partly incorporated into cell biomass via the serine pathway'\"\n\nReducing CO, to methanol is the reverse of the oxidation of methanol. In this paper, we show that it is possible and feasible to reduce CO, to methanol by methanotrophic whole cells containing the enzymes formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and methanol dehydrogenase, despite the fact that these enzymes normally oxidize their substrates in vivo or in vitro (Scheme la.). Since methane monooxygenase cannot effectively catalyze the reverse reaction of methane monooxygenation, extracellular methanol accumulation has been found in the CO, incubations.

Unfortunately, up to now, there are no known organisms whose normal biological role is reduction of CO, to methanol. In these organisms, methane is oxidized via methanol, formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide formaldehyde incorporated into cell biomass. The CO, produced from methane oxidation is partly emitted and partly incorporated into cell biomass via the serine pathway'\"\n\nReducing CO, to methanol is the reverse of the oxidation of methanol. In this paper, we show that it is possible and feasible to reduce CO, to methanol by methanotrophic whole cells containing the enzymes formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and methanol dehydrogenase, despite the fact that these enzymes normally oxidize their substrates in vivo or in vitro (Scheme la.). Since methane monooxygenase cannot effectively catalyze the reverse reaction of methane monooxygenation, extracellular methanol accumulation has been found in the CO, incubations.",

For long-term maintenance of methanol synthesis, methane was selected as a substrate for regeneration of reducing equivalent. By alternate reaction and regeneration, the results show that resting cell of M. trichosporium IMV 3011 can be used for many times to catalyze the reduction of carbon dioxide, in which the origin of the reducing equivalent is methane. It is possible to theoretically deduce that the overall reaction for methanol synthesis can be completed by biocatalysis using greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane) as raw materials without adding hydrogen.

Methanol can be produced chemically via methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etcll-s) Synthesis of methanol from carbon dioxide has several obvious advantages. For example, carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases, which have been theorized to contribute to global warming. However, the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol is fundamentally difficult to achieve under mild condition in chemical catalysis. Conventional methods for synthesizing methanol from CO, suffer from certain drawbacks such as inefficiencies, costs, high energy consumption and the need for special equipment adapted for high temperature or highly corrosive environments. Enzymatically coupled sequential reduction of CO, to methanol, using a series of reaction catalyzed by three different dehydrogenases, particularly appealing. Accordingly, a new technique for conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol that alleviates such drawbacks is desired.",

Unfortunately, up to now, there are no known organisms whose normal biological role is reduction of CO, to methanol. In these organisms, methane is oxidized via methanol, formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide formaldehyde incorporated into cell biomass. The CO, produced from methane oxidation is partly emitted and partly incorporated into cell biomass via the serine pathway'\"\n\nReducing CO, to methanol is the reverse of the oxidation of methanol. In this paper, we show that it is possible and feasible to reduce CO, to methanol by methanotrophic whole cells containing the enzymes formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenase and methanol dehydrogenase, despite the fact that these enzymes normally oxidize their substrates in vivo or in vitro (Scheme la.). Since methane monooxygenase cannot effectively catalyze the reverse reaction of methane monooxygenation, extracellular methanol accumulation has been found in the CO, incubations.",
