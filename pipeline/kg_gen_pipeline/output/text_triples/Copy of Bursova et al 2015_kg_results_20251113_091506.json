            "text_evidence": "Methanol poisoning is a relatively infrequent medical emergency and may result in significant morbidity and mortality if untreated and represents challenges for both clinicians and toxicological laboratories. Methanol is used as a solvent component of some antifreeze solutions, paints, gasoline additives and ethanol denaturants. However, most massive methanol poisonings (Argentina 1993, Norway 2002, Czech Republic 2012 and Libya 2013) were caused by the ingestion of adulterated alcoholic beverages (1-3). Methanol is a toxic substance and is metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and is then converted to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver. Therefore, the initial stage of methanol intoxication is typically asymptomatic. During the later stage (6-12 h after ingestion), serious symptoms caused by methanol and formic acid can occur. In the late phase, the diagnostic hallmark of methanol poisoning is the presence of a high anion gap, osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis. Thus, measurement of serum methanol, and ideally formic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is required to differentiate the cause of the patient's condition. Despite the toxicity at elevated serum concentrations of formic acid, it is normally present in mammals due to the degradation of amino acids and external sources like the diet, alcoholic beverages or inhalation of methanol vapors. Formic acid is commonly analyzed after derivatization with methanol to methyl formate or with ethanol to ethyl formate under acidic conditions (6, 8, 10). Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate methods for simultaneous determination of methanol and formic acid. The simultaneous measurement of toxic formic acid along with parent methanol is clearly desirable for both enhanced clinical service and the correct diagnosis. The goal of this work is simultaneous, simple and fast determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid in biological specimens by headspace GC with flame ionization detection. Previously published methods for the determination of formic acid were based on its derivatization with an excess of either methanol or ethanol, which prohibited the analysis of these alcohols along with formic acid in a single analytical procedure (6, 8). In our new method, derivatization of formic acid was achieved by using an excess of isopropanol, allowing for the simultaneous determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid.",

            "text_evidence": "Methanol is a toxic substance and is metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and is then converted to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver. Formic acid is the principle toxic metabolite that can cause severe problems at high concentrations ( . 200 mg / L) and warrants hemodialysis treatment (4). During the later stage (6-12 h after ingestion), serious symptoms caused by methanol and formic acid can occur. The symptoms specific to high serum concentrations of formic acid include visual impairment, damage to the optical nerve, abdominal discomfort, nausea and headache. Without medical intervention, the high serum concentrations of formic acid can cause respiratory and renal failure, coma and eventually death. Thus, measurement of serum methanol, and ideally formic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is required to differentiate the cause of the patient's condition. Despite the toxicity at elevated serum concentrations of formic acid, it is normally present in mammals due to the degradation of amino acids and external sources like the diet, alcoholic beverages or inhalation of methanol vapors. In previous studies, the serum formic acid concentration in living subjects has ranged up to 44 mg / L (6, 7). Formic acid is commonly analyzed after derivatization with methanol to methyl formate or with ethanol to ethyl formate under acidic conditions (6, 8, 10). Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate methods for simultaneous determination of methanol and formic acid. The simultaneous measurement of toxic formic acid along with parent methanol is clearly desirable for both enhanced clinical service and the correct diagnosis. The goal of this work is simultaneous, simple and fast determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid in biological specimens by headspace GC with flame ionization detection. Previously published methods for the determination of formic acid were based on its derivatization with an excess of either methanol or ethanol, which prohibited the analysis of these alcohols along with formic acid in a single analytical procedure (6, 8). In our new method, derivatization of formic acid was achieved by using an excess of isopropanol, allowing for the simultaneous determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid.",

            "text_evidence": "Methanol poisoning is a relatively infrequent medical emergency and may result in significant morbidity and mortality if untreated and represents challenges for both clinicians and toxicological laboratories. Methanol is used as a solvent component of some antifreeze solutions, paints, gasoline additives and ethanol denaturants. However, most massive methanol poisonings (Argentina 1993, Norway 2002, Czech Republic 2012 and Libya 2013) were caused by the ingestion of adulterated alcoholic beverages (1-3). Methanol is a toxic substance and is metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and is then converted to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver. Therefore, the initial stage of methanol intoxication is typically asymptomatic. During the later stage (6-12 h after ingestion), serious symptoms caused by methanol and formic acid can occur. In the late phase, the diagnostic hallmark of methanol poisoning is the presence of a high anion gap, osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis. Thus, measurement of serum methanol, and ideally formic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is required to differentiate the cause of the patient's condition. Despite the toxicity at elevated serum concentrations of formic acid, it is normally present in mammals due to the degradation of amino acids and external sources like the diet, alcoholic beverages or inhalation of methanol vapors. Formic acid is commonly analyzed after derivatization with methanol to methyl formate or with ethanol to ethyl formate under acidic conditions (6, 8, 10). Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate methods for simultaneous determination of methanol and formic acid. The simultaneous measurement of toxic formic acid along with parent methanol is clearly desirable for both enhanced clinical service and the correct diagnosis. The goal of this work is simultaneous, simple and fast determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid in biological specimens by headspace GC with flame ionization detection. Previously published methods for the determination of formic acid were based on its derivatization with an excess of either methanol or ethanol, which prohibited the analysis of these alcohols along with formic acid in a single analytical procedure (6, 8). In our new method, derivatization of formic acid was achieved by using an excess of isopropanol, allowing for the simultaneous determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid.",

Formic acid was derivatized with an excess of isopropanol under acidic conditions to its volatile isopropyl ester while methanol and ethanol remained unchanged. The new method was successfully used for determination of selected analytes in serum samples of intoxicated patients from among those affected by massive methanol poisonings in the Czech Republic in 2012.",

        "text_evidence": "Methanol poisoning is a relatively infrequent medical emergency and may result in significant morbidity and mortality if untreated and represents challenges for both clinicians and toxicological laboratories. Methanol is used as a solvent component of some antifreeze solutions, paints, gasoline additives and ethanol denaturants. However, most massive methanol poisonings (Argentina 1993, Norway 2002, Czech Republic 2012 and Libya 2013) were caused by the ingestion of adulterated alcoholic beverages (1-3). Methanol is a toxic substance and is metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and is then converted to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver. Therefore, the initial stage of methanol intoxication is typically asymptomatic. During the later stage (6-12 h after ingestion), serious symptoms caused by methanol and formic acid can occur. In the late phase, the diagnostic hallmark of methanol poisoning is the presence of a high anion gap, osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis. Thus, measurement of serum methanol, and ideally formic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is required to differentiate the cause of the patient's condition. Despite the toxicity at elevated serum concentrations of formic acid, it is normally present in mammals due to the degradation of amino acids and external sources like the diet, alcoholic beverages or inhalation of methanol vapors. Formic acid is commonly analyzed after derivatization with methanol to methyl formate or with ethanol to ethyl formate under acidic conditions (6, 8, 10). Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate methods for simultaneous determination of methanol and formic acid. The simultaneous measurement of toxic formic acid along with parent methanol is clearly desirable for both enhanced clinical service and the correct diagnosis. The goal of this work is simultaneous, simple and fast determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid in biological specimens by headspace GC with flame ionization detection. Previously published methods for the determination of formic acid were based on its derivatization with an excess of either methanol or ethanol, which prohibited the analysis of these alcohols along with formic acid in a single analytical procedure (6, 8). In our new method, derivatization of formic acid was achieved by using an excess of isopropanol, allowing for the simultaneous determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid.",

        "text_evidence": "Methanol poisoning is a relatively infrequent medical emergency and may result in significant morbidity and mortality if untreated and represents challenges for both clinicians and toxicological laboratories. Methanol is used as a solvent component of some antifreeze solutions, paints, gasoline additives and ethanol denaturants. However, most massive methanol poisonings (Argentina 1993, Norway 2002, Czech Republic 2012 and Libya 2013) were caused by the ingestion of adulterated alcoholic beverages (1-3). Methanol is a toxic substance and is metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and is then converted to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver. Therefore, the initial stage of methanol intoxication is typically asymptomatic. During the later stage (6-12 h after ingestion), serious symptoms caused by methanol and formic acid can occur. In the late phase, the diagnostic hallmark of methanol poisoning is the presence of a high anion gap, osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis. Thus, measurement of serum methanol, and ideally formic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is required to differentiate the cause of the patient's condition. Despite the toxicity at elevated serum concentrations of formic acid, it is normally present in mammals due to the degradation of amino acids and external sources like the diet, alcoholic beverages or inhalation of methanol vapors. Formic acid is commonly analyzed after derivatization with methanol to methyl formate or with ethanol to ethyl formate under acidic conditions (6, 8, 10). Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate methods for simultaneous determination of methanol and formic acid. The simultaneous measurement of toxic formic acid along with parent methanol is clearly desirable for both enhanced clinical service and the correct diagnosis. The goal of this work is simultaneous, simple and fast determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid in biological specimens by headspace GC with flame ionization detection. Previously published methods for the determination of formic acid were based on its derivatization with an excess of either methanol or ethanol, which prohibited the analysis of these alcohols along with formic acid in a single analytical procedure (6, 8). In our new method, derivatization of formic acid was achieved by using an excess of isopropanol, allowing for the simultaneous determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid.",

        "text_evidence": "Methanol is a toxic substance and is metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and is then converted to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver. Formic acid is the principle toxic metabolite that can cause severe problems at high concentrations ( . During the later stage (6-12 h after ingestion), serious symptoms caused by methanol and formic acid can occur. The symptoms specific to high serum concentrations of formic acid include visual impairment, damage to the optical nerve, abdominal discomfort, nausea and headache. Without medical intervention, the high serum concentrations of formic acid can cause respiratory and renal failure, coma and eventually death. Thus, measurement of serum methanol, and ideally formic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is required to differentiate the cause of the patient's condition. Despite the toxicity at elevated serum concentrations of formic acid, it is normally present in mammals due to the degradation of amino acids and external sources like the diet, alcoholic beverages or inhalation of methanol vapors. In previous studies, the serum formic acid concentration in living subjects has ranged up to 44 mg / L (6, 7). Formic acid is commonly analyzed after derivatization with methanol to methyl formate or with ethanol to ethyl formate under acidic conditions (6, 8, 10). Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate methods for simultaneous determination of methanol and formic acid. The simultaneous measurement of toxic formic acid along with parent methanol is clearly desirable for both enhanced clinical service and the correct diagnosis. The goal of this work is simultaneous, simple and fast determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid in biological specimens by headspace GC with flame ionization detection. Previously published methods for the determination of formic acid were based on its derivatization with an excess of either methanol or ethanol, which prohibited the analysis of these alcohols along with formic acid in a single analytical procedure (6, 8). In our new method, derivatization of formic acid was achieved by using an excess of isopropanol, allowing for the simultaneous determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid.",
