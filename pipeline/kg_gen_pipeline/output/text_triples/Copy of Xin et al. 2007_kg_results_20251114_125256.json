Carbon  dioxide  was  reduced  to  methanol and extracellular methanol accumulation has been found in the carbon dioxide incubations. However,  resting  cells  of  methanotrophs  have  a  finite  or  intrinsic  methanol  production capacity due to a limiting supply of intracellular reducing equivalent. It has been found that the  catabolism  of  stored  Poly\u03b2 -Hydroxybutyrate  (PHB)  can  provide  intracellular  reducing equivalents  to  improve  the  intrinsic  methanol  production  capacity. The  initial  nitrogen  and copper  concentration  in  the  culture  medium  were  studied  for  the  accumulation  of  PHB  by M. trichosporium IMV 3011, to expand its potential uses in methanol production from carbon dioxide reduction. It appeared that the total methanol production capacity was increased with increasing PHB content in cells. Resting cells containing 38.6% PHB exhibited the highest total methanol  production  capacity. But  higher  PHB  accumulation  adversely  affected  the  total methanol production capacity. The effects of methanol production process on the survival and recovery of M. trichosporium IMV 3011 were examined. The results showed that the methanol production  from  carbon  dioxide  reduction  was  not  detrimental  to  the  viability  of  methanotrophs.

Methanol  can  be  produced  chemically  via  methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etc. Strategies  for  conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol offer promising new  technologies  not  only  for  recycling  of  the  greenhouse  gas  but  also  for  an  efficient  production  of  fuel alternatives. Enzymatically  coupled  sequential  reduc-\n\ntion  of  carbon  dioxide  to  methanol,  using  a  series  of reaction  catalyzed  by  three  different  dehydrogenases (formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenases and methanol dehydrogenase), is particularly appealing (Obert and Dave 1999. We  have  investigated  whether  microorganisms  can be used as biocatalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide  to  methanol,  to  overcome  the  above-mentioned drawbacks,  since  the  enzymes  are  likely  to  be  more stable  in  the  cell  than  in  the  purified  form  and  will ensure  a  continuing  supply  of  NADH. Unfortunately, up to now, there are no known organisms whose normal  biological  role  is  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide  to methanol. In these organisms, methane is oxidized via methanol, formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide with some formaldehyde  being  incorporated  into  cell  biomass (Hanson  and  Hanson  1996). One of the  oxygen  atoms  is  reduced  to  form  H 2 O,  and  the other is incorporated into methane to form methanol. Methanol  from  endogenous  (methane  oxidation  via MMO)  is  oxidized  via  formaldehyde  and  formate  to carbon dioxide by methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase. Reducing carbon dioxide to methanol is the reverse of  the  oxidation  of  methanol. In  the  previous  works (Xin et al. 2004a , 2004b), we have explored the feasibility  of  using  the  methanotrophic cell for the methanol production  from  carbon  dioxide. The  results  showed  that  carbon  dioxide  can  be  reduced  into  methanol  by  methanotrophs. It  is  possible  and  feasible  to reduce carbon dioxide to methanol by methanotrophic whole cells containing formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  methanol  dehydrogenase, despite  the  fact  that  these  enzymes  normally  oxidize their substrates in vivo or in vitro . Since MMO cannot effectively catalyze the reverse reaction of methane monooxygenation, extracellular methanol accumulation  has  been  found  in  the  carbon  dioxide  incubations.",

Methanol  can  be  produced  chemically  via  methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etc. Strategies  for  conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol offer promising new  technologies  not  only  for  recycling  of  the  greenhouse  gas  but  also  for  an  efficient  production  of  fuel alternatives. Enzymatically  coupled  sequential  reduc-\n\ntion  of  carbon  dioxide  to  methanol,  using  a  series  of reaction  catalyzed  by  three  different  dehydrogenases (formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenases and methanol dehydrogenase), is particularly appealing (Obert and Dave 1999. We  have  investigated  whether  microorganisms  can be used as biocatalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide  to  methanol,  to  overcome  the  above-mentioned drawbacks,  since  the  enzymes  are  likely  to  be  more stable  in  the  cell  than  in  the  purified  form  and  will ensure  a  continuing  supply  of  NADH. Unfortunately, up to now, there are no known organisms whose normal  biological  role  is  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide  to methanol. In these organisms, methane is oxidized via methanol, formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide with some formaldehyde  being  incorporated  into  cell  biomass (Hanson  and  Hanson  1996). One of the  oxygen  atoms  is  reduced  to  form  H 2 O,  and  the other is incorporated into methane to form methanol. Methanol  from  endogenous  (methane  oxidation  via MMO)  is  oxidized  via  formaldehyde  and  formate  to carbon dioxide by methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase. Reducing carbon dioxide to methanol is the reverse of  the  oxidation  of  methanol. In  the  previous  works (Xin et al. 2004a , 2004b), we have explored the feasibility  of  using  the  methanotrophic cell for the methanol production  from  carbon  dioxide. The  results  showed  that  carbon  dioxide  can  be  reduced  into  methanol  by  methanotrophs. It  is  possible  and  feasible  to reduce carbon dioxide to methanol by methanotrophic whole cells containing formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  methanol  dehydrogenase, despite  the  fact  that  these  enzymes  normally  oxidize their substrates in vivo or in vitro . Since MMO cannot effectively catalyze the reverse reaction of methane monooxygenation, extracellular methanol accumulation  has  been  found  in  the  carbon  dioxide  incubations.",

PHB can be accumulated as an intracellular carbon and energy storage material by  a  variety  of  microorganisms  under  nitrogen,  phosphate, or  oxygen  limiting  condition. As  shown  in Figure 1,  Methanotrophs  may  accumulate  PHB  by  two possible  pathway  of  carbon  assimilation,  the  ribulose monophosphate pathway (RMP) and the serine pathway (Asenjo and Suk 1986). Type II bacteria using the serine pathway are the most effective  PHB  producers  (Wendlandt et al. 2001). The first step in the conversion of methane into PHB is carried  out  by  nonspecific  MMO  enzyme  systems  (Asenjo and  Suk  1986). PHB is an internal reducing-energy storage polymer that  can  be  used  as  an  alternative  reducing-energy source by a number of methanotrophs cultures under starvation  conditions  (Davis et al. 1964). In  the  PHB cycle pathways shown in Figure 1, the series of reaction involving the conversion of acetyl CoA to PHB and its depolymerization  and  oxidation  back  to  acetoacetyl CoA,  are  confirmed  by  Korotkova  (Korotkova  and  Lidstrom 2001). The degradation of PHB in most bacteria is  catalyzed  by  PHB  depolymerase, \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase,  acetoacetate-succinate-CoA  transferase and \u03b2 -ketothiolase. Degradation  of  PHB  to  acetoacetic acid would provide reducing equivalents via the action of  the  NAD + -linked \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate  dehydrogenase. A  number  of  studies  observed  a  correlation  between Trichloroethylene  (TCE)  oxidation  capacities  and  microbial PHB content (Henry and Grbic /combiningacuteaccent -Galic /combiningacuteaccent 1991, Henrysson  and  McCarty  1993,  Chu  and  Alvarez-Cohen 1996), suggesting that PHB might be used as an alternative NADH source for TCE oxidation by methanotrophs. Resting  methanotrophic  strains containing PHB as endogenous reducing power reserves may  retain  the  ability  to  reduction  carbon  dioxide longer than strains without PHB. In the present article, in order to assess better some practical applications of the resting cells in the production  of  methanol  from  CO 2 reduction, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 was studied to optimize the shake flask culture conditions for the PHB accumulation. The methanol production capabilities of methanotrophic bacteria with various PHB content were evaluated. The correlation between total methanol production capacities and microbial  PHB  content  was  investigated.",

PHB can be accumulated as an intracellular carbon and energy storage material by  a  variety  of  microorganisms  under  nitrogen,  phosphate, or  oxygen  limiting  condition. As  shown  in Figure 1,  Methanotrophs  may  accumulate  PHB  by  two possible  pathway  of  carbon  assimilation,  the  ribulose monophosphate pathway (RMP) and the serine pathway (Asenjo and Suk 1986). Type II bacteria using the serine pathway are the most effective  PHB  producers  (Wendlandt et al. 2001). The first step in the conversion of methane into PHB is carried  out  by  nonspecific  MMO  enzyme  systems  (Asenjo and  Suk  1986). PHB is an internal reducing-energy storage polymer that  can  be  used  as  an  alternative  reducing-energy source by a number of methanotrophs cultures under starvation  conditions  (Davis et al. 1964). In  the  PHB cycle pathways shown in Figure 1, the series of reaction involving the conversion of acetyl CoA to PHB and its depolymerization  and  oxidation  back  to  acetoacetyl CoA,  are  confirmed  by  Korotkova  (Korotkova  and  Lidstrom 2001). The degradation of PHB in most bacteria is  catalyzed  by  PHB  depolymerase, \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase,  acetoacetate-succinate-CoA  transferase and \u03b2 -ketothiolase. Degradation  of  PHB  to  acetoacetic acid would provide reducing equivalents via the action of  the  NAD + -linked \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate  dehydrogenase. A  number  of  studies  observed  a  correlation  between Trichloroethylene  (TCE)  oxidation  capacities  and  microbial PHB content (Henry and Grbic /combiningacuteaccent -Galic /combiningacuteaccent 1991, Henrysson  and  McCarty  1993,  Chu  and  Alvarez-Cohen 1996), suggesting that PHB might be used as an alternative NADH source for TCE oxidation by methanotrophs. Resting  methanotrophic  strains containing PHB as endogenous reducing power reserves may  retain  the  ability  to  reduction  carbon  dioxide longer than strains without PHB. In the present article, in order to assess better some practical applications of the resting cells in the production  of  methanol  from  CO 2 reduction, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 was studied to optimize the shake flask culture conditions for the PHB accumulation. The methanol production capabilities of methanotrophic bacteria with various PHB content were evaluated.

PHB can be accumulated as an intracellular carbon and energy storage material by  a  variety  of  microorganisms  under  nitrogen,  phosphate, or  oxygen  limiting  condition. As  shown  in Figure 1,  Methanotrophs  may  accumulate  PHB  by  two possible  pathway  of  carbon  assimilation,  the  ribulose monophosphate pathway (RMP) and the serine pathway (Asenjo and Suk 1986). Type II bacteria using the serine pathway are the most effective  PHB  producers  (Wendlandt et al. 2001). The first step in the conversion of methane into PHB is carried  out  by  nonspecific  MMO  enzyme  systems  (Asenjo and  Suk  1986). PHB is an internal reducing-energy storage polymer that  can  be  used  as  an  alternative  reducing-energy source by a number of methanotrophs cultures under starvation  conditions  (Davis et al. 1964). In  the  PHB cycle pathways shown in Figure 1, the series of reaction involving the conversion of acetyl CoA to PHB and its depolymerization  and  oxidation  back  to  acetoacetyl CoA,  are  confirmed  by  Korotkova  (Korotkova  and  Lidstrom 2001). The degradation of PHB in most bacteria is  catalyzed  by  PHB  depolymerase, \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase,  acetoacetate-succinate-CoA  transferase and \u03b2 -ketothiolase. Degradation  of  PHB  to  acetoacetic acid would provide reducing equivalents via the action of  the  NAD + -linked \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate  dehydrogenase. A  number  of  studies  observed  a  correlation  between Trichloroethylene  (TCE)  oxidation  capacities  and  microbial PHB content (Henry and Grbic /combiningacuteaccent -Galic /combiningacuteaccent 1991, Henrysson  and  McCarty  1993,  Chu  and  Alvarez-Cohen 1996), suggesting that PHB might be used as an alternative NADH source for TCE oxidation by methanotrophs. Resting  methanotrophic  strains containing PHB as endogenous reducing power reserves may  retain  the  ability  to  reduction  carbon  dioxide longer than strains without PHB. In the present article, in order to assess better some practical applications of the resting cells in the production  of  methanol  from  CO 2 reduction, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 was studied to optimize the shake flask culture conditions for the PHB accumulation. The methanol production capabilities of methanotrophic bacteria with various PHB content were evaluated. The correlation between total methanol production capacities and microbial  PHB  content  was  investigated.",

It  has  been found  that  resting  cell  suspensions  of M.  trichosporium IMV 3011  can  reduce  carbon  dioxide  to  methanol, which accumulated in the reaction medium. No product  peak  other  than  methanol  from  carbon  dioxide reduction  was  detected.

The  production  of  methanol  from  carbon dioxide  reached  a  maximum  after  24 h  of  incubation. The amount of methanol slowly declined after further incubation (Fig. 2), perhaps through enzymatic or nonenzymatic  degradation  of  methanol,  depletion  of intracellular reducing equivalents (eg. NAD(P)H or PQQH ), the loss of CO 2 by leak and product inhibition etc. The  effect  of  product  inhibition,  enzymatic  or  nonenzymatic degradation of methanol and the loss of CO 2 by  leak  can  be  overcome  or  reduced  by  resuspending the cells in fresh medium and conducting a repetitive batch experiments as described in materials and methods section. However, in the repetitive batch methanol production experiments, cells also lost almost 100% of their initial methanol production ability after 4 repetitions of the process.",

To evaluate PHB as a possible source of reducing power,  the  effect  of  its  monomer,  3-hydroxybutyrate, was examined as the test substrate. The first is that the PHB in resting cells can be used as a direct or indirect source of reducing  power. The  second  is  that  PHB  is  a  marker  for  a higher  reducing  power  state  in  the  cells;  i.e.,  when internal  reducing  power  is  in  excess  of  growth  needs, the cells produce PHB. M. trichosporium IMV 3011  contain  PHB  when grown under the routine conditions used in these experiments.",

In an attempt to increase PHB accumulation in the earlier stages of fermentation, cell protein synthesis was limited by further reducing the level of nitrogen in the  culture  medium  containing  various  concentration of Cu. As  shown in  Fig. 5,  for  cells  cultured  in  medium  containing  0 g/l,  0.002 g/l  and  0.004 g/l  CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O,  a similar  pattern  associated  with  KNO 3 or  NH 4 Cl  reduction  was  observed. Under  these  initial  Cu  concentration, the reduction of KNO 3 by factors of 2 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.8 g/l), 4 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.4 g/l) and 8 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.2 g/l)  did  not  result  in  an  obvious  increase  in  PHB accumulation with 168 h fermentation. However, one- fifth  NH 4 Cl  (0.1 g/l)  resulted  in  the  highest  PHB  accumulation  with  168 h  fermentation. Further  reduction of NH 4 Cl resulted in an obvious decrease in PHB accumulation with 168 h fermentation. This indicated that at NH 4 Cl concentration lower than 0.1 g/l, the synthesis of  the  enzymes  catalyzing  the  conversion  of  methane into PHB may be limited by further reducing the level of  nitrogen  in  the  culture  medium. Based  on  the  results, 1.6 g/l KNO 3 and 0.1 g/l NH 4 Cl were chosen in the culture medium to use in subsequent studies . 5, in addition to the Nitrogen depletion, a limitation of Cu may trigger further accumulation of PHB by this bacterium. These data are in agreement  with  previous  reports  that  a  Cu  limitation  triggers the accumulation of PHB  in methane-grown bacteria (Shah et al. 1996). Because the stress caused by the NH 4 Cl and Cu limitation resulted in a high cellular PHB content, Cu was further chosen as the effect factor to  induce  PHB  accumulation  in  our  experiment. M. trichosporium IMV  3011  was  cultivated  in  mineral  salt medium with various concentrations of CuSO 4 . It  was of  interest  to  measure  the  PHB  contents  of  batchcultured  cells  in  medium  containing  varying  Cu  concentration. 6, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 cells  grown  in  mineral  salt  medium  containing 0.002 g/l CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O exhibit a highest PHB accumulation,  a  PHB  accumulation  of  41.0%  was  reached  at 168 h. For cells cultured in mineral salt medium lacking Cu, a PHB accumulation of 7.5% (w/w) was reached at  168 h. However, further higher copper concentration adversely  affect  the  PHB  accumulation. CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O concentration  exceeded  0.002 g/l  resulted  in  a  lower PHB  accumulation. When  batch  cultivation  were  carried  out  under  0.003 g/l  and  0.004 g/l  CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O concentration,  PHB  accumulation  was  decreased  to only  30.3%  and  12.2%  at  168 h,  respectively. However,  the  reduction  of CuSO 4 concentration from 0.004 g/l to 0.002 g/l resulted in  slightly  lower  cell  yields  (data  not  shown). This  observation  demonstrates  that  copper  has  an  important role  in  controlling  the  PHB  accumulation  of M.  trichosporium IMV 3011.

Carbon  dioxide  was  reduced  to  methanol and extracellular methanol accumulation has been found in the carbon dioxide incubations. However,  resting  cells  of  methanotrophs  have  a  finite  or  intrinsic  methanol  production capacity due to a limiting supply of intracellular reducing equivalent. It has been found that the  catabolism  of  stored  Poly\u03b2 -Hydroxybutyrate  (PHB)  can  provide  intracellular  reducing equivalents  to  improve  the  intrinsic  methanol  production  capacity. The  initial  nitrogen  and copper  concentration  in  the  culture  medium  were  studied  for  the  accumulation  of  PHB  by M. trichosporium IMV 3011, to expand its potential uses in methanol production from carbon dioxide reduction. It appeared that the total methanol production capacity was increased with increasing PHB content in cells. Resting cells containing 38.6% PHB exhibited the highest total methanol  production  capacity. But  higher  PHB  accumulation  adversely  affected  the  total methanol production capacity. The effects of methanol production process on the survival and recovery of M. trichosporium IMV 3011 were examined. The results showed that the methanol production  from  carbon  dioxide  reduction  was  not  detrimental  to  the  viability  of  methanotrophs.

        "text_evidence": "Methanol  is  used  in  a  wide  range  of  applications. Methanol  can  be  produced  chemically  via  methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etc. Strategies  for  conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol offer promising new  technologies  not  only  for  recycling  of  the  greenhouse  gas  but  also  for  an  efficient  production  of  fuel alternatives. Enzymatically  coupled  sequential  reduc-\n\ntion  of  carbon  dioxide  to  methanol,  using  a  series  of reaction  catalyzed  by  three  different  dehydrogenases (formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenases and methanol dehydrogenase), is particularly appealing (Obert and Dave 1999. We  have  investigated  whether  microorganisms  can be used as biocatalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide  to  methanol,  to  overcome  the  above-mentioned drawbacks,  since  the  enzymes  are  likely  to  be  more stable  in  the  cell  than  in  the  purified  form  and  will ensure  a  continuing  supply  of  NADH. Unfortunately, up to now, there are no known organisms whose normal  biological  role  is  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide  to methanol. In these organisms, methane is oxidized via methanol, formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide with some formaldehyde  being  incorporated  into  cell  biomass (Hanson  and  Hanson  1996). One of the  oxygen  atoms  is  reduced  to  form  H 2 O,  and  the other is incorporated into methane to form methanol. Methanol  from  endogenous  (methane  oxidation  via MMO)  is  oxidized  via  formaldehyde  and  formate  to carbon dioxide by methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase. Reducing carbon dioxide to methanol is the reverse of  the  oxidation  of  methanol. In  the  previous  works (Xin et al. 2004a , 2004b), we have explored the feasibility  of  using  the  methanotrophic cell for the methanol production  from  carbon  dioxide. The  results  showed  that  carbon  dioxide  can  be  reduced  into  methanol  by  methanotrophs. It  is  possible  and  feasible  to reduce carbon dioxide to methanol by methanotrophic whole cells containing formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  methanol  dehydrogenase, despite  the  fact  that  these  enzymes  normally  oxidize their substrates in vivo or in vitro . Since MMO cannot effectively catalyze the reverse reaction of methane monooxygenation, extracellular methanol accumulation  has  been  found  in  the  carbon  dioxide  incubations.",

        "text_evidence": "Methanol  is  used  in  a  wide  range  of  applications. Methanol  can  be  produced  chemically  via  methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etc. Strategies  for  conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol offer promising new  technologies  not  only  for  recycling  of  the  greenhouse  gas  but  also  for  an  efficient  production  of  fuel alternatives. Enzymatically  coupled  sequential  reduc-\n\ntion  of  carbon  dioxide  to  methanol,  using  a  series  of reaction  catalyzed  by  three  different  dehydrogenases (formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenases and methanol dehydrogenase), is particularly appealing (Obert and Dave 1999. We  have  investigated  whether  microorganisms  can be used as biocatalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide  to  methanol,  to  overcome  the  above-mentioned drawbacks,  since  the  enzymes  are  likely  to  be  more stable  in  the  cell  than  in  the  purified  form  and  will ensure  a  continuing  supply  of  NADH. Unfortunately, up to now, there are no known organisms whose normal  biological  role  is  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide  to methanol. In these organisms, methane is oxidized via methanol, formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide with some formaldehyde  being  incorporated  into  cell  biomass (Hanson  and  Hanson  1996). One of the  oxygen  atoms  is  reduced  to  form  H 2 O,  and  the other is incorporated into methane to form methanol. Methanol  from  endogenous  (methane  oxidation  via MMO)  is  oxidized  via  formaldehyde  and  formate  to carbon dioxide by methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase. Reducing carbon dioxide to methanol is the reverse of  the  oxidation  of  methanol. In  the  previous  works (Xin et al. 2004a , 2004b), we have explored the feasibility  of  using  the  methanotrophic cell for the methanol production  from  carbon  dioxide. The  results  showed  that  carbon  dioxide  can  be  reduced  into  methanol  by  methanotrophs. It  is  possible  and  feasible  to reduce carbon dioxide to methanol by methanotrophic whole cells containing formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  methanol  dehydrogenase, despite  the  fact  that  these  enzymes  normally  oxidize their substrates in vivo or in vitro . Since MMO cannot effectively catalyze the reverse reaction of methane monooxygenation, extracellular methanol accumulation  has  been  found  in  the  carbon  dioxide  incubations.",

        "text_evidence": "Whereas NADH may serve directly as reducing power, storage polymers such as poly\u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate  (PHB)  may  serve  as  an  endogenous  source  of reductant in microorganisms. PHB can be accumulated as an intracellular carbon and energy storage material by  a  variety  of  microorganisms  under  nitrogen,  phosphate, or  oxygen  limiting  condition. As  shown  in Figure 1,  Methanotrophs  may  accumulate  PHB  by  two possible  pathway  of  carbon  assimilation,  the  ribulose monophosphate pathway (RMP) and the serine pathway (Asenjo and Suk 1986). Type II bacteria using the serine pathway are the most effective  PHB  producers  (Wendlandt et al. 2001). The first step in the conversion of methane into PHB is carried  out  by  nonspecific  MMO  enzyme  systems  (Asenjo and  Suk  1986). PHB is an internal reducing-energy storage polymer that  can  be  used  as  an  alternative  reducing-energy source by a number of methanotrophs cultures under starvation  conditions  (Davis et al. 1964). In  the  PHB cycle pathways shown in Figure 1, the series of reaction involving the conversion of acetyl CoA to PHB and its depolymerization  and  oxidation  back  to  acetoacetyl CoA,  are  confirmed  by  Korotkova  (Korotkova  and  Lidstrom 2001). The degradation of PHB in most bacteria is  catalyzed  by  PHB  depolymerase, \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase,  acetoacetate-succinate-CoA  transferase and \u03b2 -ketothiolase. Degradation  of  PHB  to  acetoacetic acid would provide reducing equivalents via the action of  the  NAD + -linked \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate  dehydrogenase. A  number  of  studies  observed  a  correlation  between Trichloroethylene  (TCE)  oxidation  capacities  and  microbial PHB content (Henry and Grbic /combiningacuteaccent -Galic /combiningacuteaccent 1991, Henrysson  and  McCarty  1993,  Chu  and  Alvarez-Cohen 1996), suggesting that PHB might be used as an alternative NADH source for TCE oxidation by methanotrophs. Resting  methanotrophic  strains containing PHB as endogenous reducing power reserves may  retain  the  ability  to  reduction  carbon  dioxide longer than strains without PHB. In the present article, in order to assess better some practical applications of the resting cells in the production  of  methanol  from  CO 2 reduction, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 was studied to optimize the shake flask culture conditions for the PHB accumulation. The methanol production capabilities of methanotrophic bacteria with various PHB content were evaluated. The correlation between total methanol production capacities and microbial  PHB  content  was  investigated.",

PHB can be accumulated as an intracellular carbon and energy storage material by  a  variety  of  microorganisms  under  nitrogen,  phosphate, or  oxygen  limiting  condition. As  shown  in Figure 1,  Methanotrophs  may  accumulate  PHB  by  two possible  pathway  of  carbon  assimilation,  the  ribulose monophosphate pathway (RMP) and the serine pathway (Asenjo and Suk 1986). Type II bacteria using the serine pathway are the most effective  PHB  producers  (Wendlandt et al. 2001). The first step in the conversion of methane into PHB is carried  out  by  nonspecific  MMO  enzyme  systems  (Asenjo and  Suk  1986). PHB is an internal reducing-energy storage polymer that  can  be  used  as  an  alternative  reducing-energy source by a number of methanotrophs cultures under starvation  conditions  (Davis et al. 1964). In  the  PHB cycle pathways shown in Figure 1, the series of reaction involving the conversion of acetyl CoA to PHB and its depolymerization  and  oxidation  back  to  acetoacetyl CoA,  are  confirmed  by  Korotkova  (Korotkova  and  Lidstrom 2001). The degradation of PHB in most bacteria is  catalyzed  by  PHB  depolymerase, \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase,  acetoacetate-succinate-CoA  transferase and \u03b2 -ketothiolase. Degradation  of  PHB  to  acetoacetic acid would provide reducing equivalents via the action of  the  NAD + -linked \u03b2 -hydroxybutyrate  dehydrogenase. A  number  of  studies  observed  a  correlation  between Trichloroethylene  (TCE)  oxidation  capacities  and  microbial PHB content (Henry and Grbic /combiningacuteaccent -Galic /combiningacuteaccent 1991, Henrysson  and  McCarty  1993,  Chu  and  Alvarez-Cohen 1996), suggesting that PHB might be used as an alternative NADH source for TCE oxidation by methanotrophs. Resting  methanotrophic  strains containing PHB as endogenous reducing power reserves may  retain  the  ability  to  reduction  carbon  dioxide longer than strains without PHB. In the present article, in order to assess better some practical applications of the resting cells in the production  of  methanol  from  CO 2 reduction, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 was studied to optimize the shake flask culture conditions for the PHB accumulation. The methanol production capabilities of methanotrophic bacteria with various PHB content were evaluated. The correlation between total methanol production capacities and microbial  PHB  content  was  investigated.",

In an attempt to increase PHB accumulation in the earlier stages of fermentation, cell protein synthesis was limited by further reducing the level of nitrogen in the  culture  medium  containing  various  concentration of Cu. As  shown in  Fig. 5,  for  cells  cultured  in  medium  containing  0 g/l,  0.002 g/l  and  0.004 g/l  CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O,  a similar  pattern  associated  with  KNO 3 or  NH 4 Cl  reduction  was  observed. Under  these  initial  Cu  concentration, the reduction of KNO 3 by factors of 2 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.8 g/l), 4 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.4 g/l) and 8 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.2 g/l)  did  not  result  in  an  obvious  increase  in  PHB accumulation with 168 h fermentation. However, one- fifth  NH 4 Cl  (0.1 g/l)  resulted  in  the  highest  PHB  accumulation  with  168 h  fermentation. Further  reduction of NH 4 Cl resulted in an obvious decrease in PHB accumulation with 168 h fermentation. This indicated that at NH 4 Cl concentration lower than 0.1 g/l, the synthesis of  the  enzymes  catalyzing  the  conversion  of  methane into PHB may be limited by further reducing the level of  nitrogen  in  the  culture  medium. Based  on  the  results, 1.6 g/l KNO 3 and 0.1 g/l NH 4 Cl were chosen in the culture medium to use in subsequent studies . 5, in addition to the Nitrogen depletion, a limitation of Cu may trigger further accumulation of PHB by this bacterium. These data are in agreement  with  previous  reports  that  a  Cu  limitation  triggers the accumulation of PHB  in methane-grown bacteria (Shah et al. 1996). Because the stress caused by the NH 4 Cl and Cu limitation resulted in a high cellular PHB content, Cu was further chosen as the effect factor to  induce  PHB  accumulation  in  our  experiment. M. trichosporium IMV  3011  was  cultivated  in  mineral  salt medium with various concentrations of CuSO 4 . It  was of  interest  to  measure  the  PHB  contents  of  batchcultured  cells  in  medium  containing  varying  Cu  concentration. 6, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 cells  grown  in  mineral  salt  medium  containing 0.002 g/l CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O exhibit a highest PHB accumulation,  a  PHB  accumulation  of  41.0%  was  reached  at 168 h. For cells cultured in mineral salt medium lacking Cu, a PHB accumulation of 7.5% (w/w) was reached at  168 h. However, further higher copper concentration adversely  affect  the  PHB  accumulation. CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O concentration  exceeded  0.002 g/l  resulted  in  a  lower PHB  accumulation. When  batch  cultivation  were  carried  out  under  0.003 g/l  and  0.004 g/l  CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O concentration,  PHB  accumulation  was  decreased  to only  30.3%  and  12.2%  at  168 h,  respectively. However,  the  reduction  of CuSO 4 concentration from 0.004 g/l to 0.002 g/l resulted in  slightly  lower  cell  yields  (data  not  shown). This  observation  demonstrates  that  copper  has  an  important role  in  controlling  the  PHB  accumulation  of M.  trichosporium IMV 3011. These data suggest that it is possible to increase the internal PHB content in cells by Cu concentration  control. Hence,  with  regard  to M. trichosporium IMV 3011,  mineral  salt  medium  containing 0.002 g/l  CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O  was  recommend  for  the  PHB accumulation. 0.004 g/l CuSO4\u20225H2O\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\nNH4Cl (g/l)\n\nPHB (%)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\ncell mass (g/l)\n\nPHB\n\ncell mass\n\n0 g/l CuSO4\u20225H2O\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0. 5\n\n1\n\n1. 5\n\n2\n\n2. 5\n\nKNO3(g/l)\n\nPHB content (%)\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\n1\n\n1. 2\n\n1. 4\n\n1. 6\n\n1. 8\n\n2\n\nCell mass (g/l)\n\nPHB content\n\nCell mass\n\n0 g/l CuSO4\u20225H2O\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\nNH4Cl (g/l)\n\nPHB content (%)\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\n1\n\n1. 2\n\nCell mass (%)\n\nPHB content\n\nCell mass\n\n0.002 g/l CuSO4\u20225H2O\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0. 5\n\n1\n\n1. 5\n\n2\n\n2. 5\n\nKNO3 (g/l)\n\nPHB content (%)\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\n1\n\n1. 2\n\n1. 4\n\n1. 6\n\n1. 8\n\n2\n\nCell mass (g/l)\n\nPHB content\n\nCell mass",

        "text_evidence": "It  has  been  found that  the  form  and  catalytic  activity  of  MMO  can  be controlled  by  Cu  (Park et al. 1991,  1992,  Stanley et al. 1983). In an attempt to increase PHB accumulation in the earlier stages of fermentation, cell protein synthesis was limited by further reducing the level of nitrogen in the  culture  medium  containing  various  concentration of Cu. As  shown in  Fig. 5,  for  cells  cultured  in  medium  containing  0 g/l,  0.002 g/l  and  0.004 g/l  CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O,  a similar  pattern  associated  with  KNO 3 or  NH 4 Cl  reduction  was  observed. Under  these  initial  Cu  concentration, the reduction of KNO 3 by factors of 2 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.8 g/l), 4 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.4 g/l) and 8 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.2 g/l)  did  not  result  in  an  obvious  increase  in  PHB accumulation with 168 h fermentation. However, one- fifth  NH 4 Cl  (0.1 g/l)  resulted  in  the  highest  PHB  accumulation  with  168 h  fermentation. Further  reduction of NH 4 Cl resulted in an obvious decrease in PHB accumulation with 168 h fermentation. This indicated that at NH 4 Cl concentration lower than 0.1 g/l, the synthesis of  the  enzymes  catalyzing  the  conversion  of  methane into PHB may be limited by further reducing the level of  nitrogen  in  the  culture  medium. Based  on  the  results, 1.6 g/l KNO 3 and 0.1 g/l NH 4 Cl were chosen in the culture medium to use in subsequent studies . 5, in addition to the Nitrogen depletion, a limitation of Cu may trigger further accumulation of PHB by this bacterium. These data are in agreement  with  previous  reports  that  a  Cu  limitation  triggers the accumulation of PHB  in methane-grown bacteria (Shah et al. 1996). Because the stress caused by the NH 4 Cl and Cu limitation resulted in a high cellular PHB content, Cu was further chosen as the effect factor to  induce  PHB  accumulation  in  our  experiment. M. trichosporium IMV  3011  was  cultivated  in  mineral  salt medium with various concentrations of CuSO 4 . It  was of  interest  to  measure  the  PHB  contents  of  batchcultured  cells  in  medium  containing  varying  Cu  concentration. 6, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 cells  grown  in  mineral  salt  medium  containing 0.002 g/l CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O exhibit a highest PHB accumulation,  a  PHB  accumulation  of  41.0%  was  reached  at 168 h. For cells cultured in mineral salt medium lacking Cu, a PHB accumulation of 7.5% (w/w) was reached at  168 h. However, further higher copper concentration adversely  affect  the  PHB  accumulation. CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O concentration  exceeded  0.002 g/l  resulted  in  a  lower PHB  accumulation. When  batch  cultivation  were  carried  out  under  0.003 g/l  and  0.004 g/l  CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O concentration,  PHB  accumulation  was  decreased  to only  30.3%  and  12.2%  at  168 h,  respectively. However,  the  reduction  of CuSO 4 concentration from 0.004 g/l to 0.002 g/l resulted in  slightly  lower  cell  yields  (data  not  shown). This  observation  demonstrates  that  copper  has  an  important role  in  controlling  the  PHB  accumulation  of M.  trichosporium IMV 3011. These data suggest that it is possible to increase the internal PHB content in cells by Cu concentration  control. Hence,  with  regard  to M. trichosporium IMV 3011,  mineral  salt  medium  containing 0.002 g/l  CuSO 4 \u00b7 5 H 2 O  was  recommend  for  the  PHB accumulation. 0.004 g/l CuSO4\u20225H2O\n\n0\n\n2\n\n4\n\n6\n\n8\n\n10\n\n12\n\n14\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\nNH4Cl (g/l)\n\nPHB (%)\n\n0\n\n0.2\n\n0.4\n\n0.6\n\n0.8\n\n1\n\n1.2\n\n1.4\n\n1.6\n\n1.8\n\n2\n\ncell mass (g/l)\n\nPHB\n\ncell mass\n\n0 g/l CuSO4\u20225H2O\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n0\n\n0. 5\n\n1\n\n1. 5\n\n2\n\n2. 5\n\nKNO3(g/l)\n\nPHB content (%)\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\n1\n\n1. 2\n\n1. 4\n\n1. 6\n\n1. 8\n\n2\n\nCell mass (g/l)\n\nPHB content\n\nCell mass\n\n0 g/l CuSO4\u20225H2O\n\n0\n\n1\n\n2\n\n3\n\n4\n\n5\n\n6\n\n7\n\n8\n\n9\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\nNH4Cl (g/l)\n\nPHB content (%)\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\n1\n\n1. 2\n\nCell mass (%)\n\nPHB content\n\nCell mass\n\n0.002 g/l CuSO4\u20225H2O\n\n0\n\n5\n\n10\n\n15\n\n20\n\n25\n\n30\n\n0\n\n0. 5\n\n1\n\n1. 5\n\n2\n\n2. 5\n\nKNO3 (g/l)\n\nPHB content (%)\n\n0\n\n0. 2\n\n0. 4\n\n0. 6\n\n0. 8\n\n1\n\n1. 2\n\n1. 4\n\n1. 6\n\n1. 8\n\n2\n\nCell mass (g/l)\n\nPHB content\n\nCell mass",
