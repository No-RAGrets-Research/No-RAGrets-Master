The product epoxyethane is not further metabolized and accumulates extracellularly. Thus, exhaustion of reductant and the inhibition of toxic products make it difficult to accumulate epoxyethane continuously. In order to settle these problems, regeneration of cofactor NADH was performed in batch experiments with methane and methanol. The amount of epoxyethane formed before cosubstrate regeneration was between 0.8 and 1.0 nmol/50 mg cells in approximately 8 h. Combining data from 7 batch experiments, the total production of epoxyethane was 2.2 nmol. Production of epoxyethane was improved (4.6 nmol) in 10% gas phase methane since methane acts as an abundant reductant for epoxidation. It was found that the maximum production of epoxyethane (6.6 nmol) occurs with 3 mmol/L methanol. The passive effect of epoxyethane accumulation on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV3011 in batch experiments was studied. Removal of product was suggested to overcome the inhibition of epoxyethane production.",

In addition to application in chemical manufacturing processes, epoxyethane is widely used in processes of food fumigating sterilization, particularly of grains and dried fruits [2]. Direct oxidation of ethylene to epoxyethane with molecular oxygen is a significant synthetic method for both industry and academia. One biocatalytic method for producing epoxyethane is using enzymes to insert oxygen across the carbon double bonds of ethylene. Epoxyethane synthesis by MMO catalysis has significant application potential as it is performed at normal temperature and pressure and causes no pollution. In spite of this progress, reaction conditions for biocatalytic ethylene epoxidation and the effect of epoxyethane on MMO catalytic performance have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim at using whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane from ethylene. The effect of epoxyethane concentration on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in batch experiments was studied.",

In addition to application in chemical manufacturing processes, epoxyethane is widely used in processes of food fumigating sterilization, particularly of grains and dried fruits [2]. Direct oxidation of ethylene to epoxyethane with molecular oxygen is a significant synthetic method for both industry and academia. One biocatalytic method for producing epoxyethane is using enzymes to insert oxygen across the carbon double bonds of ethylene. Epoxyethane synthesis by MMO catalysis has significant application potential as it is performed at normal temperature and pressure and causes no pollution. In spite of this progress, reaction conditions for biocatalytic ethylene epoxidation and the effect of epoxyethane on MMO catalytic performance have not yet been fully elucidated. In the present study, we aim at using whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane from ethylene. The effect of epoxyethane concentration on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in batch experiments was studied.",

The results in Figure 5 show that 10% methane initial gas phase exhibits a positive effect on epoxyethane production in batch experiments. The concentration of epoxyethane production decreased as the repetition increased during repetitive batch epoxidation experiments. The main reason is inhibition of epoxyethane production.",

Figure 1 shows that epoxyethane production increased rapidly with increasing ethylene concentration when it is less than 20% (880 /u1D707 mol/L) gas phase. The rate of epoxidation reaction appears to be relevant to the solubility of ethylene. Saturation of ethylene in the reaction system is the main reason. The time course of epoxyethane production from ethylene by whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV3011 is shown in Figure 2. The main reason is that a mixture of methane and methanol provides an abundant reductant for ethylene epoxidation with no toxicity. In other words, after the initial oxidation step, methane may be further degraded to regenerate reducing NADH, which can promote further ethylene epoxidation. Because oxidation of both ethylene and methane is catalyzed by MMO, the presence of methane may compete with ethylene to bind the MMO active site. Moreover, the epoxidation of ethylene can also be performed in the absence of methane by repeating 6 batch cycles, according to Xin et al., approximately due to the utilization of internal energy sources such as poly/u1D6FD -hydroxybutyrate",

Here, 3 mmol/L methanol addition to ethylene epoxidation reaction led a stable level of the epoxyethane production. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min. This result indicates that epoxyethane has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011.

            "text_evidence": "Epoxyethane production by whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in the presence of different concentrations of methanol is shown in Figure 6. The production of epoxyethane from ethylene by cell suspension in the absence of methanol was nearly stopped when the batch reaction was repeated in the 6th batch cycle. Thus, methanol exhibits the potential to act as the electron-donating substrate to regenerate NADH and drive epoxyethane synthesis. Here, 3 mmol/L methanol addition to ethylene epoxidation reaction led a stable level of the epoxyethane production. However, the formation of epoxyethane in the presence of 1 mmol/L methanol was still stopped when the batch reaction was repeated for the 6th batch cycle. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min. This result indicates that epoxyethane has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011.

Khishen made water fully exposed throughout the experiment to the epoxyethane at ordinary temperature The recovery of the epoxyethane was almost complete after 24 h. Thus, epoxyethane reacted very slowly with water and its reaction with water in the epoxyethane synthesis system was probably so slow as to be neglected. The structure of epoxyethane is similar to that of epoxypropane. However, epoxyethane is much more reactive because of the strain of the oxirane ring and the residual positive charge on the carbon atoms. The charge on the carbon atoms gives epoxyethane an electrophilic character. Thus, it is not surprising that epoxyethane is extremely reactive with nucleophilic molecules.

            "text_evidence": "Epoxyethane production by whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in the presence of different concentrations of methanol is shown in Figure 6. The production of epoxyethane from ethylene by cell suspension in the absence of methanol was nearly stopped when the batch reaction was repeated in the 6th batch cycle. Thus, methanol exhibits the potential to act as the electron-donating substrate to regenerate NADH and drive epoxyethane synthesis. Here, 3 mmol/L methanol addition to ethylene epoxidation reaction led a stable level of the epoxyethane production. However, the formation of epoxyethane in the presence of 1 mmol/L methanol was still stopped when the batch reaction was repeated for the 6th batch cycle. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min. This result indicates that epoxyethane has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011.

Khishen made water fully exposed throughout the experiment to the epoxyethane at ordinary temperature The recovery of the epoxyethane was almost complete after 24 h. Thus, epoxyethane reacted very slowly with water and its reaction with water in the epoxyethane synthesis system was probably so slow as to be neglected. The structure of epoxyethane is similar to that of epoxypropane. However, epoxyethane is much more reactive because of the strain of the oxirane ring and the residual positive charge on the carbon atoms. The charge on the carbon atoms gives epoxyethane an electrophilic character. Thus, it is not surprising that epoxyethane is extremely reactive with nucleophilic molecules.

However, the formation of epoxyethane in the presence of 1 mmol/L methanol was still stopped when the batch reaction was repeated for the 6th batch cycle. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min.

MMO requires a cosubstrate, NADH, for continuous catalysis of the epoxidation of ethylene. In whole cell suspension, when the cosubstrate is depleted, the epoxyethane production stops. Batch experiment data shows that addition of 10% methane or 3 mmol/L methanol improves production of epoxyethane. A major challenge in the biosynthesis process for the production of epoxyethane is inhibition of production. Results presented here reveal that Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 retains only 90% epoxyethane production capacity when cells were treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. Based on the present results, it is concluded that a whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 represents an efficient biocatalyst for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane. To make the application of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 on epoxyethane biosynthesis more feasible, uninterrupted reductant for ethylene epoxidation and continuous removal of toxic product are required.",

The product epoxyethane is not further metabolized and accumulates extracellularly. Thus, exhaustion of reductant and the inhibition of toxic products make it difficult to accumulate epoxyethane continuously. The amount of epoxyethane formed before cosubstrate regeneration was between 0.8 and 1.0 nmol/50 mg cells in approximately 8 h. Combining data from 7 batch experiments, the total production of epoxyethane was 2.2 nmol. Production of epoxyethane was improved (4.6 nmol) in 10% gas phase methane since methane acts as an abundant reductant for epoxidation. It was found that the maximum production of epoxyethane (6.6 nmol) occurs with 3 mmol/L methanol. The passive effect of epoxyethane accumulation on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV3011 in batch experiments was studied. Removal of product was suggested to overcome the inhibition of epoxyethane production.",

The product epoxyethane is not further metabolized and accumulates extracellularly. Thus, exhaustion of reductant and the inhibition of toxic products make it difficult to accumulate epoxyethane continuously. In order to settle these problems, regeneration of cofactor NADH was performed in batch experiments with methane and methanol. The amount of epoxyethane formed before cosubstrate regeneration was between 0.8 and 1.0 nmol/50 mg cells in approximately 8 h. Combining data from 7 batch experiments, the total production of epoxyethane was 2.2 nmol. Production of epoxyethane was improved (4.6 nmol) in 10% gas phase methane since methane acts as an abundant reductant for epoxidation. It was found that the maximum production of epoxyethane (6.6 nmol) occurs with 3 mmol/L methanol. The passive effect of epoxyethane accumulation on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV3011 in batch experiments was studied. Removal of product was suggested to overcome the inhibition of epoxyethane production.",

In the present study, we aim at using whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane from ethylene. The effect of epoxyethane concentration on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in batch experiments was studied.",

The results in Figure 5 show that 10% methane initial gas phase exhibits a positive effect on epoxyethane production in batch experiments. The concentration of epoxyethane production decreased as the repetition increased during repetitive batch epoxidation experiments. The main reason is inhibition of epoxyethane production.",

Here, 3 mmol/L methanol addition to ethylene epoxidation reaction led a stable level of the epoxyethane production. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min. This result indicates that epoxyethane has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011.

        "text_evidence": "Epoxyethane production by whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in the presence of different concentrations of methanol is shown in Figure 6. The production of epoxyethane from ethylene by cell suspension in the absence of methanol was nearly stopped when the batch reaction was repeated in the 6th batch cycle. Thus, methanol exhibits the potential to act as the electron-donating substrate to regenerate NADH and drive epoxyethane synthesis. Here, 3 mmol/L methanol addition to ethylene epoxidation reaction led a stable level of the epoxyethane production. However, the formation of epoxyethane in the presence of 1 mmol/L methanol was still stopped when the batch reaction was repeated for the 6th batch cycle. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane.

Khishen made water fully exposed throughout the experiment to the epoxyethane at ordinary temperature The recovery of the epoxyethane was almost complete after 24 h. Thus, epoxyethane reacted very slowly with water and its reaction with water in the epoxyethane synthesis system was probably so slow as to be neglected. The structure of epoxyethane is similar to that of epoxypropane. However, epoxyethane is much more reactive because of the strain of the oxirane ring and the residual positive charge on the carbon atoms. The charge on the carbon atoms gives epoxyethane an electrophilic character. Thus, it is not surprising that epoxyethane is extremely reactive with nucleophilic molecules.

        "text_evidence": "Epoxyethane production by whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 in the presence of different concentrations of methanol is shown in Figure 6. The production of epoxyethane from ethylene by cell suspension in the absence of methanol was nearly stopped when the batch reaction was repeated in the 6th batch cycle. Thus, methanol exhibits the potential to act as the electron-donating substrate to regenerate NADH and drive epoxyethane synthesis. Here, 3 mmol/L methanol addition to ethylene epoxidation reaction led a stable level of the epoxyethane production. However, the formation of epoxyethane in the presence of 1 mmol/L methanol was still stopped when the batch reaction was repeated for the 6th batch cycle. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min. This result indicates that epoxyethane has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011.

Khishen made water fully exposed throughout the experiment to the epoxyethane at ordinary temperature The recovery of the epoxyethane was almost complete after 24 h. Thus, epoxyethane reacted very slowly with water and its reaction with water in the epoxyethane synthesis system was probably so slow as to be neglected. The structure of epoxyethane is similar to that of epoxypropane. However, epoxyethane is much more reactive because of the strain of the oxirane ring and the residual positive charge on the carbon atoms. The charge on the carbon atoms gives epoxyethane an electrophilic character. Thus, it is not surprising that epoxyethane is extremely reactive with nucleophilic molecules.

However, the formation of epoxyethane in the presence of 1 mmol/L methanol was still stopped when the batch reaction was repeated for the 6th batch cycle. Inhibitory Effect of Epoxyethane Production on the Epoxidation of Ethane. A challenging factor in epoxyethane synthesis is that epoxyethane itself has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity. To research whether this inhibition is affecting epoxyethane production in this context, the viable cell suspension was treated with epoxyethane. Figure 7 shows the results of the relative epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011. The epoxyethane production capacity of whole cell suspension is plotted as a function of cells treated over time with epoxyethane. Here, 10 nmol/L epoxyethane irreversibly inhibits the epoxyethane production capacity totally within 30 min. However, under the same conditions, the epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 remains nearly 90% when cells are treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. For comparison, the epoxyethane production capacity of untreated cells is still close to 80% at 150 min. This result indicates that epoxyethane has an inhibitory effect on epoxyethane production capacity of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011.

Batch experiment data shows that addition of 10% methane or 3 mmol/L methanol improves production of epoxyethane. A major challenge in the biosynthesis process for the production of epoxyethane is inhibition of production. Results presented here reveal that Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 retains only 90% epoxyethane production capacity when cells were treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. Based on the present results, it is concluded that a whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 represents an efficient biocatalyst for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane. To make the application of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 on epoxyethane biosynthesis more feasible, uninterrupted reductant for ethylene epoxidation and continuous removal of toxic product are required.",

Batch experiment data shows that addition of 10% methane or 3 mmol/L methanol improves production of epoxyethane. A major challenge in the biosynthesis process for the production of epoxyethane is inhibition of production. Results presented here reveal that Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 retains only 90% epoxyethane production capacity when cells were treated with 0.1 nmol/L epoxyethane within 30 min. Based on the present results, it is concluded that a whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 represents an efficient biocatalyst for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane. To make the application of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 on epoxyethane biosynthesis more feasible, uninterrupted reductant for ethylene epoxidation and continuous removal of toxic product are required.",
