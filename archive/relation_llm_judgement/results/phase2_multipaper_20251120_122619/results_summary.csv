A Jekyll and Hyde character, it is a valuable energy source present as geological deposits of natural gas, however it is also potent greenhouse gas, released during many waste management processes. Gas-to-liquid technologies are being investigated as a means to exploit and monetise non-traditional and unutilised methane sources. The product identified as having the greatest potential is methanol due to it being a robust, commercially mature conversion process from methane and its beneficial fuel  characteristics. Commercial  methane  to  methanol  conversion  requires  high  temperatures  and pressures, in an energy intensive and costly process. In contrast methanotrophic bacteria perform the desired transformation under ambient conditions, using methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes. Although  biotechnological  applications  of  methanotrophic  bacteria have been reviewed in part, no review has comprehensively covered progress and challenges for a methane  to  methanol  process  from  an  industrial  perspective.

ABSTRACT: Methanol, a simple polar solvent, has been widely identified as an attractive carbon source to produce chemicals and fuels in bioprocesses. However, if methanol feeding is not controlled well in such a fermentation process, accumulation of the solvent in the growth media will have a detrimental effect on the cells. Hence, monitoring the levels of methanol in these fermentation processes is a crucial step to ensure a healthy culture and maximum protein production. There are various techniques elaborated in the literature for monitoring

methanol in cell cultures, but often, they appear to be expensive methods that are less affordable for many laboratories. In this study, a fast, simple, and sensitive method is developed to process biological samples by using the salting-out-assisted liquid -liquid extraction technique to quantify the concentration of methanol and ethanol using gas chromatography.
