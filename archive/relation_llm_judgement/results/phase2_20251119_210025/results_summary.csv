Thus, even with a shorter lifespan, methane has 28 -34 times higher global warming potential over a period of 100 years than that of CO2  due to its higher solar  radiation  capturing  efficiency  (Priyadarsini  et  al.,  2020).",True,5.0,5.0,"The relation is accurately represented in the sentence, as it directly states that methane persists in the atmosphere for a shorter duration compared to carbon dioxide (CO2).
