ABSTRACT: Methanol, a simple polar solvent, has been widely identified as an attractive carbon source to produce chemicals and fuels in bioprocesses. However, if methanol feeding is not controlled well in such a fermentation process, accumulation of the solvent in the growth media will have a detrimental effect on the cells. Hence, monitoring the levels of methanol in these fermentation processes is a crucial step to ensure a healthy culture and maximum protein production. There are various techniques elaborated in the literature for monitoring

methanol in cell cultures, but often, they appear to be expensive methods that are less affordable for many laboratories. In this study, a fast, simple, and sensitive method is developed to process biological samples by using the salting-out-assisted liquid -liquid extraction technique to quantify the concentration of methanol and ethanol using gas chromatography.
