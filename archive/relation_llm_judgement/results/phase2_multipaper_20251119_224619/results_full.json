Much literature exists on cultivating this organism on methane, however no one has achieved dry  cell  weight  densities  exceeding  18  g/L.  Biomass  growth  is  limited  due  to  mass transfer of methane to cells. The inoculum cultures utilized in the bioreactor studies were maintained on Noble agar plates  containing  nitrogen  minimal  salts  medium  and  methane. The enzyme activity in methanol grown cells was recovered by subculturing in liquid NMS medium with methane as the sole carbon source, the activity increased from 8 to 600 [\u00b5mol naphthol][g of biomass] -1",

SMMO  has gained a great deal of attention in the bioremediation and chemical industries because of its  low  substrate  specificity  and  its  ability  to  oxidize  chlorinated  hydrocarbons. This study investigated the growth of M. trichosporium on the water soluble carbon source, methanol while retaining sMMO activity. A biomass density  of  19  g/L  (growth  rate  of  0.013-0.065  h -1 )  was  achieved  with  sMMO activity  of  300  to  500  [\u00b5mol  naphthol][g  of  biomass] -1 After  6  months  of subsequent  plate  transfers, M.  trichosporium lost  the  ability  to  produce  high  levels  of sMMO. It is recommended that further studies be carried out on stimulating sMMO activity during cultivation on methanol.",

This study investigated the growth of M. trichosporium on the water soluble carbon source, methanol while retaining sMMO activity. A biomass density  of  19  g/L  (growth  rate  of  0.013-0.065  h -1 )  was  achieved  with  sMMO activity  of  300  to  500  [\u00b5mol  naphthol][g  of  biomass] -1 After  6  months  of subsequent  plate  transfers, M.  trichosporium lost  the  ability  to  produce  high  levels  of sMMO.

A Jekyll and Hyde character, it is a valuable energy source present as geological deposits of natural gas, however it is also potent greenhouse gas, released during many waste management processes. Gas-to-liquid technologies are being investigated as a means to exploit and monetise non-traditional and unutilised methane sources. The product identified as having the greatest potential is methanol due to it being a robust, commercially mature conversion process from methane and its beneficial fuel  characteristics. Commercial  methane  to  methanol  conversion  requires  high  temperatures  and pressures, in an energy intensive and costly process. In contrast methanotrophic bacteria perform the desired transformation under ambient conditions, using methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes. Although  biotechnological  applications  of  methanotrophic  bacteria have been reviewed in part, no review has comprehensively covered progress and challenges for a methane  to  methanol  process  from  an  industrial  perspective. All  published  examples  to  date  of methanotroph catalysed conversion of methane to methanol are collated, and standardised to allow direct comparison. The focus will be on conversion of methane to methanol by whole-cell, wild type, methanotroph cultures, and the potential for their application in an industrially relevant process.

Gas-to-liquid technologies are being investigated as a means to exploit and monetise non-traditional and unutilised methane sources. The product identified as having the greatest potential is methanol due to it being a robust, commercially mature conversion process from methane and its beneficial fuel  characteristics. Commercial  methane  to  methanol  conversion  requires  high  temperatures  and pressures, in an energy intensive and costly process. In contrast methanotrophic bacteria perform the desired transformation under ambient conditions, using methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes. Although  biotechnological  applications  of  methanotrophic  bacteria have been reviewed in part, no review has comprehensively covered progress and challenges for a methane  to  methanol  process  from  an  industrial  perspective. All  published  examples  to  date  of methanotroph catalysed conversion of methane to methanol are collated, and standardised to allow direct comparison. The focus will be on conversion of methane to methanol by whole-cell, wild type, methanotroph cultures, and the potential for their application in an industrially relevant process.

However, if methanol feeding is not controlled well in such a fermentation process, accumulation of the solvent in the growth media will have a detrimental effect on the cells. Hence, monitoring the levels of methanol in these fermentation processes is a crucial step to ensure a healthy culture and maximum protein production. There are various techniques elaborated in the literature for monitoring\n\n*\n\ns\u0131\n\nSupporting Information\n\nmethanol in cell cultures, but often, they appear to be expensive methods that are less affordable for many laboratories. In this study, a fast, simple, and sensitive method is developed to process biological samples by using the salting-out-assisted liquid -liquid extraction technique to quantify the concentration of methanol and ethanol using gas chromatography. Followed by this, a validation test for the developed method was performed, which resulted in good peak resolution, linearity, and limit of detection for the quantitation of methanol and ethanol. Such an approach facilitates the possibility to monitor and control the methanol levels in fermentation and aids in bioprocess optimization.",
