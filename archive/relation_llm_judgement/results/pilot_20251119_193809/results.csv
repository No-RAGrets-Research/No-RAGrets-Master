Priyadarsini et al. 202320251115.pdf,"Major  sources  of  methanotrophs  include  agricultural  rice  fields, natural gas fields, dairy and cattle industries, etc. It is interesting to note that majority of methane (90 %) emitted in the wetland rice fields comes from the vascular transport system within the rice plants instead of ebullition or diffusion through the rhizosphere. The rate at which methane is emitted is much less ( < 20 %) than the actual rate of production in the rice fields. The difference in the  rate  of  production  and  emission  can  be  explained  by  methane oxidation by the methanotrophs present in the oxic regions of the rice roots  and  rhizospheres  (Conrad  and  Rothfuss,  1991).

Priyadarsini et al. 202320251115.pdf,"Major  sources  of  methanotrophs  include  agricultural  rice  fields, natural gas fields, dairy and cattle industries, etc. The difference in the  rate  of  production  and  emission  can  be  explained  by  methane oxidation by the methanotrophs present in the oxic regions of the rice roots  and  rhizospheres  (Conrad  and  Rothfuss,  1991). The  conversion efficiencies  of  transported  methane  by  methanotrophs  remain  in  the range of 70 -95 % in the soil-water interface (Epp and Chanton, 1993; Gilbert  and  Frenzel,  1995). The  rice  field  rhizosphere  community comprises of type I and type II methanotrophs. In fact, no Type I methanotrophs had been isolated from rice rhizosphere, rice roots, bulk soil or floodwater and  only  their  presence  was  confirmed  using  molecular  techniques (Dianou et al., 2012; Pandit et al., 2016; Takeda et al., 2008). Several methanotrophs  with pmoA lineages  from  rice  paddy  cluster  (e.g., RPC1 -3)  have  been  detected  but  remain  uncultured  till  date  (Knief, 2015; Lüke et al., 2014). Methanol production capability of these methanotrophs is yet to be studied. Thus, rice field was chosen for this study since  they  are  a  breaming  source  of  methanotrophs  and  they  are commonly found across India.",,,,,2.780780076980591,,True,,,"The subject ""methanotrophs"" is explicitly mentioned as a source, and the object ""natural gas fields"" is listed among the major sources of methanotrophs.
