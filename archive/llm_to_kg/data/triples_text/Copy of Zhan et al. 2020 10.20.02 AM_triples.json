These drawbacks indicate that methanol is not an ideal carbon and energy source for fermentations using P. pastoris . An alternative approach to utilize methanol is to develop synthetic methylotrophs that can efficiently metabolize methanol either as a sole carbon and energy source, or as co -substrates with other carbohydrates.

In this process, the carbon in formaldehyde is released as CO2, but the proton generated is used to supply energy for biological processes. The first module of methanol oxidation can be catalyzed by three methanol oxidoreductases, differentiated by their electron acceptor: (i) pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) -dependent methanol dehydrogenase (PMDH), (ii) NAD + -dependent methanol dehydrogenase (NMDH) and (iii) O2 -dependent alcohol oxidase (AOX). Among these, PMDH is the most complex as it requires the PQQ | prosthetic group to transfer electrons to cytochrome c . In Methylobacterium extorquens , the expression of up to 15 genes are required to realize its function (M. Zhang & Lidstrom, 2003; W. Zhang et al., 2017). Even in betaproteobacteria with monomeric PMDH (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2008), at least 4 -7 additional enzymes are still required to synthesize PQQ, which additionally requires molecular oxygen (Velterop et al., 1995).

ACT acts by removing the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) moiety of the NMDH -bound NAD + (Arfman et al., 1997; Wu et al., 2016), which increases the affinity of NMDH for methanol and NAD + (Arfman et al., 1991). Therefore, this simple two -component system is much easier to construct than the PMDH complex (Velterop et al., 1995).

This means that the recombinant strains harboring NMDH must be grown at very high temperatures (45 -55°C) to facilitate methanol oxidation, which is not feasible for most microorganisms. The third methanol oxidoreductase, AOX, is mainly found in eukaryotic methylotrophs such as P. pastoris . Although this oligomeric flavoenzyme alcohol oxidase has relatively low affinity for both methanol and oxygen, its Gibbs energy is much lower ( Δ r G ʹ = -99.2 kJ mol -1 ) than the other two enzymes (Cereghino & Cregg, 2000; W.

However, a significant energy barrier of NMDH must be overcome, which requires HCHO and NADH to be maintained at low concentrations to ensure that the reaction favors methanol oxidation. To improve NMDH activity and increase its affinity to methanol, two strategies have been tested. The first is to express an NAD -dependent but ACT -independent Mdh2 enzyme. Both directed evolution and protein engineering have been used to construct such a synthetic enzyme. For example, directed molecular evolution has resulted in a mutated version of CT4 -1 (A126V, A31V, A169V) which has a 6 -fold higher K cat /K m for methanol (9.3 M -1 S -1 ) and 10 -fold lower K cat /K m for n -butanol (48 M -1 S -1 ) in vitro (Wu et al., 2016).

The second strategy to improve NMDH activity is to compress the reaction space. For example, by using a scaffoldless self -assembly methodology to organize Mdh, Hps, and Phi into an engineered supramolecular enzyme complex via SH3 -ligand interaction pairing, in vitro production of fructose -6 -phosphate (F6P) from methanol improved 97 -fold (Price et al., 2016).

Among these metabolic intermediates, formaldehyde is the most toxic to many microorganisms. Studies have shown that the growth defect of methylotrophic yeast ( Pichia methanolica ) on high methanol media is not caused directly by methanol toxicity, but rather by formaldehyde toxicity (Wakayama et al., 2016). To counter this toxicity, the formaldehyde dissimilation pathway can be activated to detoxify formaldehyde (Pfeifenschneider et al., 2017).

Hannes et al. have shown that the Xu5P regeneration pathway has been duplicated in the evolution of P. pastoris , which has been compartmentalized into the peroxisome (Rußmayer et al., 2015). This indicates that engineering of enzyme compartmentalization may be an alternative strategy to improve the recycling of metabolic intermediates in methanol utilization pathways. 5. CONCLUSION REMARKS In recent years, much attention has been focused on the development of methylotrophic organisms due to the significant advantages of methanol fermentation and its potential application in conversion of methane.

Design In the process of engineering native and nonnative methylotrophy, most efforts have been focused on introducing natrual pathways into model microbes. However, each natural pathway presents a different set of drawbacks, therefore different synthetic novel pathways may be better suitable for different applications. For example, computational analysis of thousands of metabolic reactions to address energy consumption and carbon loss, have led to several nonnatural formaldehyde assimilation pathways (Yang et al., 2019).
