In batch and continuous studies, the rate of methanol accumulation falls low after a certain initial period due to depletion of  the intracellular NADH2 pool. The reducing power  could be regenerated by  supply of  sodium formate in the feed stream to the reactor. Both phosphate ions and duration of   supply of  formate affect methanol biosynthesis in the continuous reactor.
