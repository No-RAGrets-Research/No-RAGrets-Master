Studies of the model Type II methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b have provided insight into multiple aspects of methanotrophy, including methane assimilation, copper accumulation, and metal-dependent gene expression. Development of genetic tools for chromosomal editing was crucial for advancing these studies. Recent interest in methanotroph metabolic engineering has led to new protocols for genetic manipulation of methanotrophs that are effective and simple to use. We have incorporated these newer molecular tools into existing protocols for Ms. trichosporium OB3b.

INTRODUCTION Methanotrophic bacteria are unique in their ability to utilize methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as their sole carbon source (Hanson & Hanson, 1996). In the first step of their metabolic pathway, methane is oxidized to methanol, which can be utilized as a cheap carbon feedstock for industrial chemical processes (Lawton & Rosenzweig, 2016). For this reason, there have been extensive efforts to understand methanotrophy in multiple species of bacteria. Most aerobic methanotrophs are classified as Type I (Gammaproteobacteria) or Type II (Alphaproteobacteria) based on their use of either the ribulose monophosphate or serine cycles for carbon assimilation,\n\nOutput: [('methanotrophic bacteria', 'unique', 'in their ability to utilize methane'), ('methane', 'oxidized', 'to methanol'), ('methanol', 'utilized', 'as a cheap carbon feedstock for industrial chemical processes'), ('Type I', 'ribulose monophosphate cycle', 'carbon assimilation'), ('Type II', 'serine cycle', 'carbon assimilation')] Here's how we arrived at these triples:\n\n1. \"methanotrophic bacteria\" -> \"unique\" -> \"in their ability to utilize methane\": This triple captures the key fact that methanotrophic bacteria possess an"

Methane is oxidized to methanol by methane monooxygenase enzymes (MMOs), followed by methanol conversion to formaldeyhde by methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs). There are two types of MMO, a soluble and cytoplasmic iron-containing enzyme (sMMO) and a 'particulate' and inner membrane-bound copper-containing enzyme (pMMO) (Ross & Rosenzweig, 2016). With the exception of the genera Methylocella and Methyloferula , aerobic methanotrophs express pMMO under most conditions (Semrau et al., 2010; Vorobev et al., 2011). Under copperstarved conditions, some Type I and Type II methanotrophs can switch to sMMOexpression(Semrauetal., 2010), and some Methylosinus and Methylocystis species also produce the copper chelator methanobactin (Dassama, Kenney, & Rosenzweig, 2017).

The first one is a type of bacteria called Methylobacterium which has been found to be able to break down cellulose and other complex carbohydrates into simple sugars through a process known as hydrolysis. Hydrolysis involves breaking down large molecules into smaller ones using enzymes such as cellulase and hemicellulase. These enzymes are produced by the bacteria and help them digest food more efficiently. In addition, there are several other examples of bacteria that have been discovered to possess these properties including Rhodococcus erythropolis, Bacillus subtilis, and Pseudomonas put"

Cultures are grown under either low copper (0.1 μ M CuSO4) or high copper (10 -25 μ M CuSO4) conditions in liquid cultures and agar plates. Many genes of interest in methanotrophs are copper regulated, and it may be necessary to alter the copper concentration to ensure viability and to avoid selection against the genetic modifications. Similar considerations may be appropriate for genes regulated by other environmental factors. Initially, cells at an OD 600 of 0.1 are inoculated into 50mL cultures in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks sealed with rubber septa.

However, it is sometimes difficult to insert methanotroph genes, including those in the pmo operon, into this plasmid due to leaky expression at high copy number and subsequent toxicity of the product proteins in E. coli (Ojala et al., 2011). We have employed the following two strategies to circumvent this issue. First, we use the chemically competent E. coli strain CopyCutter EPI400 (Lucigen), designed to control plasmid copy number, to increase the success rate for cloning of methanotroph genes. However, the plasmid must then be incorporated into the E. coli donor strain S17-1 (Simon, Priefer, & P € uhler, 1983) for subsequent conjugation. Transformation into S17-1 can also fail due to leaky expression.

GENETIC MANIPULATION VIA CONJUGATION The most common and efficient method for genetic manipulation in methanotrophs requires conjugation (Lloyd et al., 1999; Murrell, 1994; Smith & Murrell, 2011). Typically after conjugation, the shuttle plasmid is incorporated into the chromosome of the recipient strain, followed by counterselection to ensure double recombination and removal of the vector backbone from the chromosome (Lalioti & Heath, 2001). In Ms. trichosporium OB3b, the established conjugation method involves the addition of liquid cultures of both methanotroph and E. coli cells onto a 0.2μ msterile filter paper for mating (Smith & Murrell, 2011).
