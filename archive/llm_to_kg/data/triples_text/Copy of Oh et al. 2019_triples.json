The direct hydration of ethylene is accomplished at 250-300 °C and 70-80 atm in the presence of steam [4]. The requirement of high temperature and high pressure causes an increase in production cost [5]. In the case of bioethanol fermentation, one molecule of glucose produces two molecules of bioethanol with release of two molecules of CO2.

Some methanotrophs possess both sMMO and pMMO, and the expression of sMMO and pMMO is regulated by copper concentration. Cells expressing pMMO have a higher growth rate due to the higher affinity of pMMO for methane [13,14]. Ethane is used for the production of ethylene by steam cracking.

Bioethanol under the optimal conditions was produced with the maximum titer of 0.52 g/L and volumetric productivity of 0.4 g/L/h, respectively. Ethane was successfully converted to ethanol, without the generation of carbon dioxide, simply by employing methanotrophs as the biocatalyst and ethane as the substrate. This study demonstrates that methanotroph-catalyzed bioconversion can be applied for ethanol production from ethane as a biological gas-to-liquid technology.
