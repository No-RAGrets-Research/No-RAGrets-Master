To date, high-purity methane (CH4 > 97%) has been used in the production of methanol by methanotrophs. Such production requires purification and separation processes, which are costly.

The biggest difference was that maintaining an effective single species as a dominant species, using wastewater and biogas, was not possible owing to biological contamination and interference, unlike in controlled laboratory environments. Bacterial clusters of different taxa accumulated to form a bacterial community in which the bacteria are interdependent. The formed bacterial communities were useful in methanol production and wastewater processing [21-24]. Another key difference from controlled laboratory conditions, where only pure methane was used, was the existence of new effectives species under high CO2 ratio of ≥ 30%. The key species in the bacterial community were the Methylophilus strains that used the methanol produced by methanotrophs. Additionally, new species of methanotrophs classified as type X have been observed in experiments using biogas, compared with those using only methane [24].

In the current study, for the effective use of CO2 in biological carbon fixation and wastewater treatment and for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), we explored biological carbon fixation using bacterial community and biogas. The concept of CO2 fixation by methanotrophs first emerged following the discovery a new methanotroph species that produces methanol from CO2 through the Calvin-BensonBassham (CBB) cycle in the Verrumicrobia phylum. However, this species is a thermophilic methanotroph that inhabits high-temperature environments, such as volcanoes and hot springs; thus, it cannot be widely used for CO2 fixation [25-27]. However, some methanotrophs, such as type X methanotrophs, may be induced to become parts of bacterial community and use CO2 as a substrate to reduce excess CO2 into methanol [28].

In the second step, CO2 is reduced to methanol by the generated methanotrophs. Reduction of CO2 to methanol is the reverse reaction of methane oxidation to CO2. To reduce CO2 to methanol, a high reducing power is required to induce a reaction that is against the law of energy. In other words, NADH is required to reduce CO2 to formaldehyde, and pyrroloquinoline quinol (PQQH2) is needed to reduce formaldehyde to methanol [25-28]. In this study, we aimed to assess the optimum conditions for generating the driving force of reverse reaction against the law of energy in bacterial community through experiments, as well as to use this reaction to biologically fix and remove greenhouse gases, such as CH4 and CO2, for effective use in wastewater treatment. For these purposes, we efficiently maintained the bacterial community using biogas mainly consisting of CH4 and CO2 instead of manufactured or purified CH4 as carbon sources for bacteria.

Conclusions This study propose the use of biogas generated from an urban wastewater treatment plant and a bacterial community comprising methanotrophs, Methylophilus , and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, as an effective method of biological carbon fixation and nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment for CCUS. A significant level (11.2%) of type X methanotroph strains were identified only in methanotrophs cultured with CO2 and biogas. Following culture with CO2 only, higher cell concentration of bacterial community and greater relative ratio of type X methanotrophs were observed with increasing methanol production. At type X methanotroph ratio of 19% and cell concentration of 1025 mg · L -1 , the maximum methanol concentration of 0.41 mM was achieved.
