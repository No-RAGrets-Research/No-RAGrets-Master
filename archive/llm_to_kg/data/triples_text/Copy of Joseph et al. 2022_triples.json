In addition, it is important to note that the accuracy of the method depends on the quality of the samples and the precision of the analytical instruments used. Finally, it is recommended to perform internal quality control checks during the analysis process to ensure the reliability of the results. The final step is to validate the method through external validation studies, where the performance of the method is compared with reference methods or established standards. This will help to confirm the robustness and reproducibility of the method. It is essential to consider these factors when selecting an appropriate analytical method for your research needs"

The peak resolution between methanol and ethanol was estimated by injecting a processed sample containing 0.1% (w/v) of both analytes in Milli-Q water. To attain an acceptable peak separation between the two volatile components, the chromatographic method was initially optimized by altering the split ratios.

This graph demonstrates that a smooth evolution of the methanol concentration as a function of time can be determined to monitor the bioprocesses. Comparison against an HPLC Method. The accuracy of the developed method was verified by comparing with the accuracy of an HPLC method to assess the concentration of methanol present in the fermentation samples. This was performed in accordance with the published work of Parpinello and Versari. 41 According to this method, the samples were injected into the system without any preprocessing step.\n\nOutput: facts = [\n    ('GC', 'was injected into', None),\n    ('Figure 6', 'results attained from these injections', None),\n    ('P. pastoris', 'utilizing methanol', 'methanol'),\n    ('batch mode fermentation process', 'a graph is plotted to indicate the consumption of methanol in a batch mode fermentation process together with the increase in cell biomass', None),\n    ('methanol concentration', 'consumption of methanol in a batch mode fermentation process together with the increase in cell biomass', None),\n    ('smooth evolution', 'evolution of the methanol concentration as a function of time',"

It was observed that the linearity attained using the HPLC method showed a lower coefficient of determination ( R 2 ), which was approximately 0.941 in comparison with the GC method. Therefore, the concentration range in the calibration curve was adjusted to attain a higher R 2 value. The adjusted calibration curve is indicated in Figure 7b, where a methanol concentration range of 1.563 -100 g/L was used, resulting in an R 2 value of 0.991.

Based on the calibration curve attained from the HPLC method, the concentration of methanol in the bioreactor samples was estimated. It was observed from these results, as indicated in Figure 8, that the estimated values resulted in an initial concentration of 7.410 g/L, which was much lower than the actual initial concentration of 10 g/L of methanol in the sample. The differences observed in the estimated values of methanol from the HPLC analysis can be arising from interferences present in the methanol samples, which are not pretreated before injection. The SALLE technique, on the other hand, ensures the removal of these interferences from the samples, thereby ensuring the accurate estimation of methanol concentration. 24130 https://doi.org/10.1021/acsomega.2c00055 ACS Omega 2022, 7, 24121 -24133 ACS Omega http://pubs.acs.org/journal/acsodf Article Cell density\n\nOutput: information about the subject, predicate and object is missing.

The technique established through this study can be easily applied to biological samples with minimal volumes of the sample and solvent. Moreover, this process will allow a fast analysis of the volatile components considered, which makes it convenient to use for routine analysis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that it can be applied to matrices that are used in P. pastoris fermentation processes. The recovery of the analyte after such a processing step was good and showed good reproducibility and linearity for actual samples retrieved from bioprocesses. To the author's knowledge, such a technique for analyses and quantification of methanol and ethanol found in yeast fermentation has not yet been investigated and is therefore envisaged to be an alternative for laborious or expensive techniques required for routine analysis. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * sı Supporting Information The Supporting\n\nOutput: URLs are provided for each document associated with the content.
