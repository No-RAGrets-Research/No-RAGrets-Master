The production of syngas requires high temperature and pressure which leads to problems associated with reactor materials, operation and maintenance.

Current technology for the conversion of methane to methanol is based on energy intensive endothermic steam reforming followed by catalytic conversion into methanol. The one-step method performed at very low temperatures (35 ◦ C) is methane oxidation to methanol via bacteria. The aim of this work was to examine the role of copper in the one-step methane oxidation to methanol by utilizing whole cells of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b bacteria. From the results obtained it was found that copper concentration in the medium influences the rate of bacterial biomass growth or methanol production during the process of methane oxidation to methanol. The presented results indicate that the process of methane oxidation to methanol by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b bacteria is most efficient when the mineral medium contains 1.0 × 10 -6 mol dm -3 of copper.

Oxygen was used as an oxidant. Primary difficulty encountered during the direct partial oxidation of methane to methanol with high yield is associated with the activation of the methane C-H bond. Methane is quite inert so traditional approaches require quite high temperatures, where chemistry is dominated by radical pathways and is determined by the C-H bond strength. The first dissociation energy in methane is as high as 440 kJ mol -1 . The required product (methanol) is much more active under these reaction conditions. Dissociation energy of the C-H bond in CH 3 OH is 393 kJ mol -1 . At high temperatures methanol is easier to be activated and oxidized than methane, leading to deep oxidation resulting in CO and CO 2 (Berndt et al., 2000). Many publications on partial oxidation of methane at high pressures (1 MPa) have been published.

At lower pressures (0.1 MPa), the catalyst plays a crucial role in the partial oxidation of methane. In most cases, the reactions were carried out at temperatures higher than 500 ◦ C and HCHO was obtained as a partial oxidation product (Foulds et al., 1993; Brown & Parkyns, 1991; Otsuka & Hatano, 1987).

The disadvantage of this method is the use of strong acids and the two stages of the method. First, methane is oxidized to ester and then methanol is obtained by hydrolysis. The one-step method performed at a very low temperature (35 ◦ C) relies on the methane oxidation to methanol by bacteria. In nature there are some kinds of bacteria with the unique ability to oxidize methane as the sole source of carbon and energy. Methanothropic bacteria, or methanothrophs, are a subset of a physiological group of bacteria known as methylotrophs.

Methanotrophs are divided into two types depending on whether they assimilate carbon via the monophosphate pathway (RMP) in which formaldehyde is condensed with ribosome 5-phosphate (type I), or via the serine pathway (type II). The first two enzymes involved in methane oxidation are methane monooxygenase MMO and methanol dehydrogenase MDH. MMO oxidizes methane to methanol and MDH catalyses the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde (Wittenbury et al., 1970).

Dalton et al. (1984) and Takeguchi and Okura (1999) found that an increase in the copper content causes an increase in the rate of biomass growth. A similar phenomenon was observed in the natural environment of copper compounds (Bender & Conrad, 1995). The authors carried out the study on biomass growth using copper concentration higher than 1.5 × 10 -6 mol dm -3 . However, there is lack of information on the influence of copper concentrations below 1.5 × 10 -6 mol dm -3 on the rate of the biomass growth of bacteria Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b.

Methanol forming as a result of methane oxidation, supplied in a continuous mode to the reactor, causes qualitative changes of monooxygenase produced in the bacteria cells. As a consequence, inhibition of the process by formed metabolite occurred, whereas the growth of bacteria biomass was accelerated. This hypothesis is confirmed by the studies of other authors (Harwood & Pirt 1972; Wilkinson & Harrison, 1973). It results from these studies that the growth of bacteria from a group of obligate methanotrophs to which the Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b strain can be classified, may limit even small amounts of methanol added to the nutrient medium. Methanol present in the nutrient medium also causes the total or partial disappearance of the cells ability to oxidize methane. A solution of the problem of methane oxidation process inhibition by the formed metabolite could be the application of mixed cultures of methanothropic bacteria.

However, it is not yet known whether and how this influences the increase of yield of methanol production from methane. Conclusions Author copy Author copy The process of methane oxidation to methanol by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b bacteria proceeds most effectively when carried out in a nutrient medium containing 1.0 × 10 -6 mol dm -3 of copper. Under these conditions, a satisfactory growth of biomass was also achieved. It is worthy to note that the studies presented in this paper concern biochemical oxidation of methane to methanol applying whole cells of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b bacteria, carried out at the temperature of 30 ◦ C. The possibility of such significant lowering of temperature of methane conversion to methanol is very promising.\n\nOutput: [('Wittenbury et al.', 'indicate', 'the fact that the symbiosis of such mixed cultures consists in the mutual removal of growth inhibitors from the nutrient medium by cultivated strains.'),\n ('Lamb & Garver', 'and', 'Garver'),\n ('Benstead et al.', 'indicate', 'that the symbiosis of such mixed cultures consists in the mutual removal of growth inhibitors from the nutrient medium by cultivated strains.'),\n ('Author copy', 'concludes', 'The process of methane oxidation to methanol by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b bacteria proceeds most effectively when carried out in a nutrient medium"
