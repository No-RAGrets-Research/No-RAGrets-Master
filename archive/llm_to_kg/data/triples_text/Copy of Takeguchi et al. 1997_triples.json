When methane  is oxidized, the  product is  subsequently oxidized  by methanol  dehydrogenase contained in  the  same bacterium. To prevent further oxidation of  methanol, the  cell suspension was treated by cyclopropanol, an irreversible inhibitor for  methanol  dehydrogenase, leading to  extracellular methanol  accumulation. However,  the  reaction\n\nOutput: [('Copyright GLYPH<14>9 1997', 'by', 'Humana Press Inc.'), ('All rights of any nature whatsoever eserved.', 'reserved.', None)]"

Methane  mono-oxygenase  (MMO)  catalyzes the  single-step oxidation of  methane  to  methanol  according to  the  following equation: Purified MMO is not  suitable in  methanol  synthesis reaction, because of  the  instability. Thus,  the  production of  methanol  from methane with methanotroph  was tried. When  the  cell suspension was treated by cyclopropanol, which  was an  irreversible inhibitor for  MDH,  it led  to  extracellular methanol  accumulation, as  shown in  Scheme 1 (1). In  this paper, we hope to  describe the  improvement  of  methanol  yield by selecting culture and  reaction conditions.

By selecting the  culture  conditions and reaction conditions, methane hydroxylation activity in  the  cell was kept  for  a  long time  and the  methanol  production  (the efficiency) dramatically increased.
