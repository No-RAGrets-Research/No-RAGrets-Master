Baker 1 An industrial process for the selective activation of methane under mild conditions would be highly valuable for controlling emissions to the environment and for utilizing vast new sources of natural gas. The only selective catalysts for methane activation and conversion to methanol under mild conditions are methane monooxygenases (MMOs) found in methanotrophic bacteria; however, these enzymes are not amenable to standard enzyme immobilization approaches.

The spatial organization of enzymes in living organisms enables substrate channelling by decreasing diffusion distances between complementary enzyme containing materials, reducing the probability of unfavourable synthetic pathways and isolating unfavourable products 50,51 . To make process improvements to large-scale methanol production, 3D printing could be used to directly fabricate reactor components, or to prototype reactor component geometries, which might later be fabricated as enzyme-embedded polymer components using conventional means (for example, molding or extrusion). 3D printing allows fabrication of geometries that are inaccessible by conventional means, the ability to print enzyme gradients (to minimize the amount of enzyme required for a given volumetric productivity) and the ability to control the location of multiple materials within a structure (for example, to supply reducing equivalents). Ultimately, the cost of 3D printing the reactor\n\nOutput: sentences = [\n    ('cofactor regeneration', 'is defined as', 'the spatial organization of enzymes in living organisms'),\n    ('spatial organization of enzymes', 'enables', 'substrate channelling'),\n    ('substrate channelling', 'by decreasing', 'diffusion distances between complementary enzyme containing materials'),\n    ('decreasing', 'diffusion distances', 'between complementary enzyme containing materials'),\n    ('reducing', 'the probability of unfavourable synthetic pathways'),\n    ('isolating', 'unfavourable products', 'from each other'),\n    ('To make process improvements to large-scale methanol production"

This work opens a pathway for high-throughput biocatalysis suitable to the large-scale and gas-liquid reactions in the energy sector. However, several important hurdles remain, such as achieving enzyme longevity, enhancing throughput and situating pMMO within a larger reaction chain that supplies the necessary reducing agent. NADH is costly, unstable and not viable for industrial use. A convenient reductant for industrial use would be hydrogen, which can be used to regenerate NADH catalysed by hydrogenase enzymes, and which can be reformed from a portion of the methane fed to the system. Such a reaction might be achieved by co-immobilization of hydrogenase 52 with pMMO, which would have the further advantage that all the reactants are gas phase and all the products are aqueous, simplifying reactantproduct separation.
