Compared to carbon dioxide   (CO 2 ),   CH 4 is 25 times more potent at trapping radiation; thus, the emission of   CH 4 to the atmosphere causes severe global warming and climate change. To mitigate   CH 4 emissions and utilize them effectively, the direct biological conversion of   CH 4 into liquid fuels, such as methanol   (CH 3 OH), using methanotrophs is a promising strategy. However, supplying biocatalysts in an aqueous\n\nOutput: [('Yan-Yu Chen', 'Author', 'Yan-Yu Chen'), ('Masahito Ishikawa', 'Author', 'Masahito Ishikawa'), ('Katsutoshi Hori', 'Author', 'Katsutoshi Hori')]\n\nThis output contains only the subject, relation, and object of each triple extracted from the given text.

Results An inverse membrane bioreactor (IMBR), which combines the advantages of gas-phase bioreactors and membrane bioreactors, was designed and constructed for the bioconversion of   CH 4 into   CH 3 OH in this study. In contrast to the conventional membrane bioreactor with bacterial cells that are immersed in an aqueous phase, the filtered cells were placed to face a gas phase in the IMBR to supply   CH 4 directly from the gas phase to bacterial cells. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative methanotroph, was used to demonstrate the bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH 3 OH in the IMBR.

Although    CH 4 bioconversion  shows  great  potential as an economical GTL technology, it still faces some difficulties in achieving efficient conversion for commercialization. One of the difficulties occurs due to the low solubility of   CH 4 and oxygen   (O 2 ) in water. Since the conventional methanotrophic process is generally conducted in the aqueous phase [8-13], the limitation of the amount of dissolved   CH 4 results in a low productivity of   CH3OH. Although various configurations of bioreactors for methanotrophic reactions have been proposed to enhance the process of dissolving   CH 4 in the aqueous phase, such as stirred tank reactors and bubble-lift reactors [14-16], the process consumes high amounts of energy to deliver gaseous substrates to the cells by stirring or bubbling.
