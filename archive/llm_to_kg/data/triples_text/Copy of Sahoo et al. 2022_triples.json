Introduction Overpopulation and economic development have led to increased greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the pre-industrial era, resulting in unprecedented levels of atmospheric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The consequent effect has been reflecting through global climate change and enhanced global warming since the mid-20th century. Worldwide anthropogenic emission of CO2 has almost hit 43.1 billion tonnes (Global Carbon Project Budget, 2019). Methane has a global warming potential 28 -36 times that of CO2 over a 100-year-timescale (US EPA, 2020).

There have been initiatives on methanol production via MMO (soluble and particulate) catalysed biological oxidation of methane (Mardina et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2016a, 2020a). However, MDH and other enzymes cause subsequent sequential oxidation of the produced methanol  into  intermediate  metabolites  and  CO2,  resulting  in  decreased extracellular methanol accumulation (Sheets et al., 2016).

Although, particulate MMOs are also involved in the methanol production metabolism, but they do not require any cofactors for their activity.

For instance, the use of NaCl or NH4Cl alone resulted in an increase in methanol production, while the combination of these two inhibitors led to a significant increase in methanol production.

Further,  the  model  provided  an  insight  into  the dissolved methane concentration profile (Fig. 5) as one of the key outputs, thereby offering an easy alternate solution to energy intensive and expensive experimental methods (Aldhafeeri et al., 2020). As the gas was  continuously  sparged  throughout  the  batch  run,  the  overall methane  concentration  initially  increased  and  reached  a  saturation value, beyond which it was approximately constant (Fig. 5). A decrease in the concentration of dissolved methane was observed from 21 h to 100 h, implying a higher substrate uptake rate due to the exponential growth phase of the bacteria. 3.3.2.

The dissolved CO2 concentration eventually became zero, at which point the methanol production was also seen to be saturated. 4. Conclusions Two-stage integrated bioprocess was demonstrated for bio-methanol synthesis using M. trichosporium coupled with sequestration of methane and carbon dioxide. Improved biomass titer, methane fixation rate and methanol titer  was  achieved  via  optimization  of  process  parameters. Semi-batch stirred tank reactor used in the first stage addresses the key challenge  of  mass  transfer  limitation  of  methane  from  gas  to  liquid phase.  Methanol  titer  in  the  second  stage  was  found  to  be  critically dependent on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the headspace of batch reactor. A kinetic model was developed to capture phenotypic response of the methanotroph under varying process parameters.
