Today a number of alternate strategies for methane conversion, which engage nitrate, sulfate, or three metal oxides to fulfill oxygen's functions, are being discussed. Below, the cost of each conversion is estimated based on the current prices of the nutrients required for methane oxidation. Aerobic methane conversion requires an oxygen input with at least a 1:1 methane to oxygen ratio. Oxygen is widely available, but it is a pricy feedstock. The cost of oxygen is directly linked to energy cost (mostly electricity) and might vary from $100 to $125 per ton. 27 That estimation would bring the cost of aerobic methane conversion to at least $200-$250 per one ton of methane (Figure 13.1).
