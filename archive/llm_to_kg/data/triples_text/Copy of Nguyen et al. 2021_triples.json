Introduction Methane, which is the major constituent of biogas and natural gas, is a far stronger greenhouse gas than CO2 (Lee et al., 2019b; Nguyen and Lee, 2020). Due to the low cost and abundance of methane in natural sources, it is considered a potential next-generation carbon feedstock for the  biochemical  industry,  as  well  as  a  sustainable  energy  resource (Conrado and Gonzalez, 2014; Fei et al., 2014; Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015; Strong  et  al.,  2016a).

Hence, there has been a resurgence in interest in methanotrophs, which are able to use methane as a sole energy and carbon source under mild growth conditions (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016). These strains have great potential as a platform strain for the utilization of methane for chemical production, and also in the mitigation of climate change via removing methane as greenhouse gas (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015; Strong et al., 2016a). There are different groups and types of methanotrophs depending on the three different pathways primarily employed by methanotrophs to assimilate  formaldehyde  into  biomass:  the  Ribulose  monophosphate (RuMP) pathway occurring in Group I methanotrophs (Gammaproteobacteria, Type I and Type X), the serine cycle of Group II methanotrophs A B S T R A C T Methane,  the  predominant  element  in  natural  gas  and  biogas,\n\nOutput: information.

The soluble methane monooxygenase  (sMMO)  (mostly  present  in  Type  II  more  than  Type  I methanotrophs) can catalyze both the oxidation of methane and the transformation of a wide spectrum of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives (Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008). Thus, sMMO can play an important role in the bioremediation of polluted environments as well as biocatalyst for biotransformation (Dalton, 2005; Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008). Moreover, most of Type II methanotrophs have been shown to be capable of nitrogen fixation, while only some Type I methanotrophs have such capability (Auman et al., 2001; Stein, 2018; Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008).

Furthermore, Type II methanotrophs employ the glutamate cycle with glutamine synthetase and glutamine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT) system for NH4 assimilation, whereas Type I methanotrophs assimilate NH4 predominantly  via  reductive  pyruvate  or α -ketoglutarate  amination (Trotsenko  and  Murrell,  2008).  The  GOGAT  of  Type  I  is  peculiar  to NADPH and is quite unsteady, while this enzyme is more stable in Type II methanotrophs and specific for NADH cofactor (Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008). Another advantage of methanotrophs is their ability to utilize either nitrate or ammonium as a nitrogen source, where the growth rate  of  methanotrophic  bacteria  is  affected  by  the  nitrogen  source.

This strain uses the EMC pathway for carbon assimilation, and a significantly large portion of the cellular carbon (approximately 60%) is derived from CO2. The data suggested that the serine cycle is divided into two functional branches, including the ' C1-fixation ' branch and the ' EMC pathway ' branch (known as ' glyoxylate regeneration ' ). The EMC pathway plays an important role in providing intermediates such as malate, acetyl-CoA, and glyoxylate, to cells (Yang et al., 2013).

In order to use Type II methanotrophs as an efficient industrial platform, an improved system-level understanding of cells, such as gene expression regulation, regulating mechanism of C1 metabolism, and metabolic flux distribution, is necessary for the suitable design of engineering strategies in Type II methanotrophs. Type II methanotrophs have lower biomass yields on methane in comparison with Type I methanotrophs due to the redox arm mechanism for methane oxidation (Bordel et al., 2019b; Bordel et al., 2019c; Naizabekov and Lee, 2020); this mechanism should be revisited to find a suitable way to improve cell growth. Additionally, the native serine cycle in Type II methanotrophs could be re-established to enhance methane utilization as well as the productivity of products from Type II methanotrophic strains (Nguyen and Lee, 2020). Type II methanotrophs showed potential for the production of acetoacetyl-CoA- as well as EMCderived products (Bordel et al., 2019b), but the\n\nOutput: sentences = [\n    ('metabolism', 'is used by', 'Type II methanotrophs'),\n    ('cells', 'are required for', 'gene expression regulation'),\n    ('C1 metabolism', 'regulates', 'the mechanism for methane oxidation'),\n    ('cell growth', 'should be improved', 'by revisiting the mechanism'),\n    ('native serine cycle', 'could be established', 'to enhance methane utilization'),\n    ('potential for the production of acetoacetyl-CoA-', 'produces', 'EMC derived products')\n] Here's how we arrived at each triple:\n\n1. \"metabol"

Therefore, the construction of glyoxylate shunt as the replacement for the EMC pathway might be necessary for accumulation of EMC-derived products (Nguyen and Lee, 2020; Schada von Borzyskowski et al., 2018). The establishment of a synthetic pathway in non-native host from the natural cycle existing in methanotrophs has emerged recently and brings another sustainable way for C1 bioconversion. By applying the suitable genes from natural serine cycle present in Type II methanotrophs, the reductive glycine pathway was constructed in the non-native hosts and considered a potential route to establish formatotrophic microbes such as E.  coli,  S.  cerevisiae, and C.  necator ,  opening  the  door  for  the  C1derived formate bioeconomy in a microbial platform (Claassens et al., 2020; Doring et al., 2018; Gonzalez de la Cruz et al., 2019; Yishai et al., 2018).
