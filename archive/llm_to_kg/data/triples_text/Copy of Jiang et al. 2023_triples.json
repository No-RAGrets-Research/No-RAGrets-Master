However, the storage, transportation, and distribution of biogas are costly since the energy density of biogas is low [6,7]. Additionally, biogas is a potent greenhouse  gas,  which  could  cause  environmental  problems  if  not properly treated or utilized [8,9]. One approach to address this issue is to upgrade biogas to methanol which is a promising energy carrier for long-term storage and a valuable precursor for the production of fuels and chemicals [10]. Bio-conversion of CH4 to methanol is attractive for the cleaner process,  milder  operating  conditions,  and  less  biogas  purification  requirements than thermochemical conversion methods [11]. In nature, methanotrophs can grow by using CH4  as the sole carbon and energy source, acting as a CH4 sink to suppress its emission to the atmosphere [12 -14]. In cells of aerobic methanotrophs [14], the conversion of CH4 to methanol is catalyzed by methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzyme (equation (1)), and methanol\n\nOutput: facts = [\n    ('United States', 'is part of', '[4,5]'),\n    ('storage', 'of', 'biogas'),\n    ('transportation', 'and', 'distribution'),\n    ('costly', 'since', 'the energy density of biogas is low'),\n    ('greenhouse', 'gas', 'potent'),\n    ('environmental', 'problems', 'could be caused'),\n    ('approach', 'to address', 'this issue'),\n    ('upgrade', 'biogas', 'to methanol'),\n    ('methanol', 'is', 'a promising energy carrier'),"

One challenge to the microbial biogas-to-methanol approach is that H2S in biogas can inhibit methanotrophic microorganisms, and H2S removal is usually energy-intensive and costly [46].

The maximum cell to CH4 yield (0.333 g cells/g CH4) and maximum CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency (0.22 mol/mol) were obtained through evaluating the effects of environmental factors on cell growth and methanol production. Microbial community analysis revealed that sulfide oxidizing bacteria may have a limited contribution to the high H2S tolerance of HTMC due to their low abundancies ( < 0.01% -0.13%), and high H2S tolerant methanotroph(s) could exist in the consortium. Besides, Cyanobacteria is the most predominant phylum (32.61%) in the HTMC, indicating a great potential for simultaneous utilization of CH4 and CO2 from raw biogas.
