The methanol is further oxidized to formaldehyde  by  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH).  We developed a novel compulsory circulation diffusion system for  cell  cultivation.

A  single 12 h batch reaction at 25°C yielded a final concentration of 13.2 mM methanol. The use of a repeated batch mode, in which the accumulated methanol was removed after each of  three  8  h  cycles  over  a  24  h  period,  showed  a  productivity of 2.17 µ mol methanol/h/mg dry cell wt. Finally, a  lab-scale  reaction  performed  using  a  3  L  cylindrical reactor with a working volume of 1 L produced 13.7 mM methanol after 16 h.

The use of repeated batch methodology increases the overall yield of methanol from a given cell biomass. These results provide straightforward means for  increasing  the  production  of  biological  methanol  and for  increasing the overall utility  of methane as an energy source.
