Introduction Methane  (CH4),  the  main  component  of  natural  gas,  biogas,  and shale gas, has been used as a significant energy source for a long time. In the past decade, its abundance and relatively low price have made CH4 a promising next-generation carbon feedstock (Fei et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the use of CH4  as a carbon feedstock is still limited because its conversion is hindered by an extremely stable C -H bound (440 kJ/mol of  the  dissociation  energy  of  the  C -H  bond)  (Bjorck  et  al.,  2018). Although the conversion of CH4 with chemical catalysts has been studied extensively, most of the reactions involved are energy intensive and ecologically unfriendly (Wang et al., 2017). Methanotrophs, a group of microorganisms, utilize CH4  as the sole carbon and energy source, with their unique enzymes and\n\nOutput: [('Methane', 'main component of natural gas', None),\n ('Methane', 'biogas', None),\n ('Methane', 'shale gas', None),\n ('Methane', 'energy source', None),\n ('methane', 'abundance', 'long time'),\n ('methane', 'low price', 'promising next-generation carbon feedstock'),\n ('methane', 'conversion', 'hindered by an extremely stable C-H bound'),\n ('methane', 'C -H bond', 'dissociation energy of the'),\n ('methane', 'C -H bond', '44"

This property of methanotrophs allows them to be used as biocatalysts for the conversion of CH4 into valuable products at ordinary temperature and pressure, supporting the development of green bioprocesses. Many methanotrophic bioprocesses have been applied to obtain various products, such as methanol (Patel et al., 2020a, 2020b), polyhydroxyalkanoates (Pieja et al., 2011; Strong et al., 2016), single-cell proteins (Petersen et al., 2017; Zha et al., 2021), liquid biofuels (Furutani et al., 2014), succinic acid (Subbian, 2017), and isoprenoids (Jeon et al., 2019). Even though additional market-valuable products could be synthesized, methanotrophic bioprocesses still face multiple challenges. For instance, the low water solubility of CH4  and oxygen (O2) is one of the major factors limiting the development of industrial  processes  (Bjorck  et  al.,  2018).

Hence, vigorous agitation in the form of bubbling or stirring is required to  dissolve  CH4 and  O2 into  the  aqueous  phase  to  supply  them  to methanotrophic cells, resulting in high energy consumption. Microbial gas-phase reactions have been proposed to enhance the rate of mass transfer of gaseous substrates from the gas phase to biocatalysts, especially for hydrophobic gases (e.g., CH4 and O2) (Kulishova & Zharkov,  2017;  Webb,  2017).  Unlike  in  typical  bioreactions  in aqueous solutions, for gas-phase reactions biocatalysts are immobilized on solid supports in the absence of an aqueous solution as a suspension medium. The removal of the aqueous solution allows biocatalysts to directly contact hydrophobic gases, and mediate biocatalytic reactions in the gas phase. Without the need for vigorous agitation, gaseous substrates can be driven by a small pressure drop or be supplied in a passive way with low energy consumption.

In a previous study, we evaluated the ability of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative gammaproteobacterial methanotroph (Ward et al., 2004), to degrade CH4  in microbial gas-phase reactions. Notably, the rate of CH4 degradation in a gas-phase reaction without active supply of gases was much higher than that in an aqueous phase reaction, with stirring (Chen et al., 2020). This increase in the rate of CH4  degradation upon improved availability of gaseous CH4 and O2 implies that the metabolism of M. capsulatus (Bath) in  a  microbial  gas-phase  reaction  is  quite  different  from  that  in  the aqueous phase reaction.

This process is catalyzed by methanotrophic bacteria such as Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), which oxidizes methane into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. These bacteria play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by converting methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into less harmful substances like carbon dioxide and water. Methane is considered one of the most significant contributors to climate change due to its high heat-trapping capacity. However, it's important to note that while methane has a large warming potential, it also serves as a natural buffer"
