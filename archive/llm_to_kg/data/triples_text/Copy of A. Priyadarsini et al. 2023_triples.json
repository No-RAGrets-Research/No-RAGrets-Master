India is an agriculturebased country with abundant paddy cultivation. Paddy cultivation is one of the largest sources in the global budget of methane emissions (Wang et al., 2022a). It is interesting to note that majority of methane (90 %) emitted in the wetland rice fields comes from the vascular transport system within the rice plants instead of ebullition or diffusion through the rhizosphere.

Results 3.1. Preamble: enrichment of rice field soil cultures Isolation  of  methanotrophic  bacteria  is  a  time-consuming  and tedious process. The methanotrophs are strongly associated with heterotrophic  satellites  around  them  in  their  community  (Dedysh  and Dunfield, 2011). So, the initial growth is often attributed to the growth of satellite bacteria growing on products from methanotrophic bacteria.

Since, the growth was also observed in control experiments within 3 days, which were not fed with methane, it can be inferred that initial growth attributes to the heterotrophic community and not the methanotrophs.  However, methanotrophic bacteria have been reported to grow in 4 -5 days from inoculation. Pure cultures are isolated bacteria that help in study of single species. In contrast, use of enriched culture has  economic  and  practical  advantage  over  pure  cultures.  Microbial consortium has more tolerance to potential contaminants in the feed gas (Jiang et al., 2023). So, the cost associated with the purification of feed gas  for  fermentation  can  be  significantly  reduced.  This  shows  that methanotrophic bacteria has better adaptability and applicability  towards changing environment while growing in a community (Han et al., 2013). Moreover, isolation of pure strains needs longer incubation time period and\n\nOutput: the turbidity of the cultures is identified by an increase\nthe growth was observed in control experiments within 3 days\ninitial growth attributes to the heterotrophic community and not the methanotrophs\nmethane was not fed with methane\ncontrol experiments were not fed with methane\nit can be inferred that initial growth attributes to the heterotrophic community and not the methanotrophs\nsince the growth was also observed in control experiments within 3 days\nwhich were not fed with methane\nit can be inferred that initial growth attributes to the heterotrophic community and not the methanotrophs\nhowever, meth"

Discussion Methanotrophs efficiently convert methane to methanol in a single step using methane monooxygenase enzymes at ambient reaction conditions.  The  production  of  methanol  occurs  intracellularly  by  both pMMO  and  sMMO.  Extracellular  methanol  accumulation  is  usually achieved by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibition (Patel et al., 2016c).  In  this  study,  methanol  production  was  achieved  without addition of MDH inhibitors. The samples from initial culture and fifth day  enriched  cultures  were  taken  and  examined  for  the  presence  of methanol using gas chromatography. The methanol production in the pure strains of M. capsulatus and M. buryatense were also examined after 5 days of incubation (Fig. 2). It is very interesting to note here that these results are consistent with the gene detection results.

Conclusions Here, we have shown that the use of enriched cultures from rice field soil in place of pure cultures ( M. buryatense and M. capsulatus ) can also produce similar quantities (130 mM, 160 mM and 132.5 mM, respectively) of methanol. An added advantage of microbial cultures enriched from natural resources is that they are highly stable and robust against environmental variations,  which  makes  them  most  suitable  for  large scale operations. This study, thus, opens up a spectrum of new possibilities for methanol production from an economically friendly route of BioGTL process and also provide a possible solution for effective on-spot utilization of isolated natural gas pockets.
