Raising the Cuz+  concentration from 1 VM to 5 p~ effected a transition from soluble to particulate  MMO activity,  and  changes in  major  cell  polypeptides  were  observed  on SDSpolyacrylamide  gels. Organisms containing soluble MMO oxidized a wide range of  substrates including  n-alkanes,  n-alkenes,  aromatic  and  alicyclic  compounds.  By  contrast,  organisms containing  particulate  MMO  did  not oxidize  aromatic  or  alicyclic  compounds.  These observations provide further evidence that the two types of MMO are fundamentally different. INTRODUCTION The oxidation  of  methane  to methanol by  methanotrophs  is catalysed  by  methane monooxygenase (M  MO).  Scott et  al.

Particulate  MMO  was  present  in  organisms grown  in continuous culture  under oxygen-limited, nitrate-excess  conditions,  whilst  soluble MMO was present  in nitrate-depleted  cultures.  It was suggested  therefore,  that the availability of nitrate might determine the intracellular location of MMO (Scott et al., 1981 a,  b). Stanley et at. (1983) have  now  shown  that  in Methylococcus  capsulatus (Bath) and M. trichosporium OB3b  the intracellular location of MMO is determined by the availability  of copper; particulate cell-free MMO activity  was observed  when  the organisms were  grown  at high  Cuz+  :biomass ratios, whereas  organisms  subjected  to  copper  deficiency  contained  soluble  MMO.

The ability of MMOs from a number of methanotrophs to oxidize a wide range of substrates is well documented (Colby et al., 1977; Stirling et al., 1979; Higgins et al., 1979; Pate1 et al., 1980). These  substrates  include n-alkanes, n-alkenes and  ethers,  and  aromatic, alicyclic and heterocyclic compounds. Methylomonas methanica, however, appears to have a more restricted substrate range. The particulate cell-free MMO from this organism does not oxidize aromatic, alicyclic  and  heterocyclic  compounds (Stirling et  al., 1979).

DISCUSSION This work corroborates the finding of Stanley et al. (1983) that copper availability determines the intracellular location (soluble  or particulate) of MMO in M. trichosporium OB3b. This is also the case for Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (Stanley et al., 1983). Research to date (Scott et al., 1981 a; Stanley et al., 1983)  has indicated that there are differences between soluble and particulate MMOs besides their intracellular location, which suggest that the particulate enzymes are not derived from the soluble  enzymes merely by membrane attachment. Our results support and extend previous findings. In both M. trichosporium OB3b and M. capsulatus (Bath) the inhibitor profile of  the soluble MMOs differs considerably from that of the particulate enzyme (Scott et al., 1981 a; Stanley et 3332 A.

This is supported by the recent observations of Leak & Dalton, (1983). Our findings show that the particulate MMO of M. trichosporium OB3b differs from the soluble enzyme in that it is unable to oxidize aromatic or alicyclic compounds (both enzymes oxidize methane, propene and n-alkanes). This suggests that the hydroxylase components of  the two enzymes are different, and provides a further important distinction  between the two types of MMO. It is of interest to note that the substrate specificity  of the particulate M M O   of Methj-lomonas methanica (Stirling et al., 1979) is the same as that reported  here for the corresponding enzyme from M. trichosporium OB3b.

It has been suggested that methanotrophs might be used as biocatalysts in order to carry out epoxidations  and hydroxylations on an industrial  scale (Higgins et a/., 1981 ; Whittenbury & Dalton,  1982; Hou,  1984).

By  contrast, nothing is known of  the polypeptide composition of  the respective particulate enzymes. Stanley et al. (1 983) have shown that three major polypeptides are present in cell-free  extracts prepared from suspensions of M.  capsulatus (Bath) which contain soluble MMO. These correspond to the three subunits (mol. wt 54000,42000, 17000)  of component A of the soluble MMO of this organism, and may constitute up to 30% of the total soluble protein (Woodland & Dalton, 1984).  All three polypeptides disappear during the copper-induced transition from soluble to particulate MMO, whilst additional membrane-bound polypeptides accumulate (Stanley et al., 1983).  The levels of some of the major cellular polypeptides of M. trichosporium OB3b appear to change in a similar fashion, although it is not known at present whether any of these correspond to components of the soluble or particulate  MMOs.
