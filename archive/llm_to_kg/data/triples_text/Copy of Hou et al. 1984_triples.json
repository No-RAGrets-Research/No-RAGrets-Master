Methanotrophic bacteria have  been  shown to oxidize  gaseous alkenes  to the corresponding epoxides  utilizing an NADHz-dependent  methane monooxygenase. A cell  paste  of methane-grown methylotrophs was coated on  porous  glass beads. The production of  propylene  oxide  from propylene  was performed  in  a gas-solid bioreactor to  ensure  continuous production and removal  of  product  epoxide from the  microenvironment  of  the  biocatalyst. The amount of  propylene oxide  produced  before cofactor regeneration was between 120-145 ~moles/20  mg cells in  about  10  h depending on  the  microbial strains used.

Introduction The  epoxidation  of alkenes  (Colby et al. 1977; Higgins  et  al.  1979; Hou  et  al.  1979a;  Patel et  al. 1979) and the  hydroxylation of  alkanes  (Patel et  al. 1980b;  Hou et  al. 1981b)  by  methylotrophic bacteria in  both  whole cells and cell-free systems  have been reported. Methane monooxygenase  requires a  cofactor, NADH2, for  catalyzing both  the  epoxidation of alkenes  and the  hydroxylation of  alkanes. Obligate methanotrophs  cannot  utilize compounds with carbon-carbon bonds. The product epoxides accumulate extracellularly. In  whole  cell systems, the  epoxidation of  alkenes  and the  hydroxylation of  alkanes  do not require an exogeneous  supply  of  cofactor, NADH  2 (Hou  et  al. 1979a). When the  cofactor is depleted, the epoxidation or hydroxylation stops.
