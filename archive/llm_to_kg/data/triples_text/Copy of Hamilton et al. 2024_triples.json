Introduction Greenhouse gases (GHGs), mostly CO2, methane and nitrous oxide, are the main drivers of climate change. The emission of all GHGs needs to be targeted but reducing methane emissions would bring the biggest benefits in a short-time frame. Methane has a global warming potential (GWP100) 27-30 times stronger than CO2, meaning that 1 kg of emitted methane has 27-30 more climate effect than 1 kg of CO2 in a 100 year time frame [1, 2]. Removing atmospheric methane and reducing anthropogenic methane emissions by 30% is one of the ambitious but urgently needed tasks for slowing climate-change progression.

The general idea for such biofiltration systems is to capture methane emissions and convert them into CO2, with minimal biomass production to prevent the system from bio-clogging. However, keeping microbes in an active methane utilization stage with limited biomass production is challenging and often results in an unstable system. Microbial methane oxidation provides cell carbon, energy, and water release by two pathways: Q1. CH4 + 2O2 = CO2 + 2H2O (oxidationenergy) Q2. CH4 + O2 = CH2O + H2O (assimilationbiomass). The ratio between the pathways will differ in response to nutrient availability or environmental conditions (e.g. pH/salinity/temperature or oxidative stress). About 50% of the methane consumed is oxidized. Environmental stressors (high or low pH, salinity, and temperature) will shift the methane flux toward oxidation for energy generation.

Mathematical model The model used for the column in the LEAFs design employs a matrix of loosely packed hydrogel spheres seeded with M. alcaliphilum 20Z R cells. Based on this matrix preparation, the simple mathematical model uses one basic building block: a 7 mm sphere (measured with a ruler) coated by a monolayer of methanotrophs.

Based on consultations with a colleague in the coal mining industry, it was assumed that power requirements for maintaining equivalent VAM gas flow would be increased by 10% to account for the minor VAM gas obstruction presented by the LEAF reactor, adding 5.4 million kWh of electricity use per year in each scenario. Estimated power consumption was calculated by taking known VAM gas flow power consumption from a coal mine within the same region, and linearly scaling to the match the flow rate used in this study. No supplemental heating or cooling was assumed to be provided to the LEAF reactor, assuming that VAM gas temperature was sufficient to meet the needs of the reactor. In different parts of the world, using different methane gas sources, this assumption may need to be revisited with additional LCA work.
