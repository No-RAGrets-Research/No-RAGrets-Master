Methane-rich biogas has low power density so cannot be considered as a good substrate for the microbial fuel cell. The power density of methane-rich biogas can be increased by its conversion to methanol. Twostep strategy has been followed for the production of methanol from methane-rich biogas and its utilization in a microbial fuel cell. Methanol production using methanotrophs is an attractive way for  the  valorisation  of  waste-derived  biogas.

Biological conversions are generally more attractive than thermochemical conversions [5]. A diverse group of bacteria commonly known as methanotrophs uses monooxygenase (MMO) for the oxidation which converts methane to methanol. These bacteria consume two reducing equivalents for the oxidation of a single molecule of methane. Normally, formate dehydrogenase (FDH), methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), and formal dehydrogenase (FalDH) further result in oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide (CO2) w hich generates reducing equivalents of six per molecule of methanol. That's why, production of methanol with methanotrophs is accomplished by the use of MDH inhibitors such as phosphate and sodium chloride (NaCl), and usually provides external electron donors which are generally formatted to carry out the metabolic activity and survival of methanotrophs [5].
