    "caption": "slow growth rate of methanotrophs, low methane solubility and\nmetal ion dependency (16,17). Different process designs like batch\nmode fermentation, membrane reactor, use of co-culture and\nvarious immobilization strategies have also been investigated\npreviously\nfor\nmethanol\nproduction\n(18e21).\nTable\n1\n(12,15,16,18,22e25) shows recent literature summary of yield,\ntiter and speciﬁc productivity of methanol production by different\nmethanotrophs. Studies on inhibition of methanol dehydrogenase\n(MDH), co-culture biotransformation, use of methane vector and\nregeneration of co-factor from formate have been reported to\nimprove\nmethanol\nproduction\n(1,16,20,26).\nAlthough\nseveral\nstudies have been explored towards production of bio-methanol,\nthe comparison of methanol production between different strains\nis difﬁcult due to variation in culturing protocols, varying cell\nconcentration in biotransformation reaction and supply of reducing\nagent. Important factors like selection of methanotrophic strain,\nfrom a wide diversity of methanotroph and characteristics like\nmethanol tolerance have not been systematically investigated so\nfar. Methanol being a bulk chemical and its production process\nmust be designed to incur the lowest possible cost. Selection of\nsuitable methanotrophic platform can play a key critical role in\nminimizing process requirements and operational costs. Key char-\nacteristics of methanotroph like optimum temperature for growth,\nmethanol tolerance, methane conversion rate, titer, yield and pro-\nductivity can have an impact on the overall cost of the bioprocess.\nIn the present study, an industrially suitable organism was\nsystematically selected from wide diversity of genus and species of\nmethanotrophs. Selected strains were investigated for methanol\ntolerance, requirements of reducing energy and optimization of\nMDH inhibitors. Methanol production using biogas generated on\nsecond generation feedstock was also evaluated.",
