However, excessive phosphate addition may also inhibit \nFDH (formate dehydrogenase) in HTMC, which would cause a decrease \nin methanol concentration under higher phosphate concentration [5]. \nThe effect of formate addition on methanol concentration has a \nsimilar tendency to that of phosphate addition (Fig. 3c). The maximum \nmethanol concentration of 0.23 mg/mL was obtained with a formate \naddition of 100 mmol/L in 48 h (Fig. 3c). When formate addition \ndecreased to 50 mmol/L, a peak methanol concentration of 0.16 mg/mL \nwas obtained in 24 h and then decreased to 0 in 48 h (Fig. 3c). Higher \nlevels of formate addition (150 mmol/L and 200 mmol/L) didn’t further \nincrease the methanol concentration, obtaining peak methanol con­\ncentrations of 0.18 mg/mL and 0.11 mg/mL, respectively (Fig. 3c). \nThese results were also consistent with other reports on conversion of \nCH4 to methanol by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b [39,40]. When \nMDH is inhibited for methanol accumulation, exogenous formate will \nfunction as an additional electron donor to provide electrons for cell \nactivity [6], but too high formate could be toxic to cells as well. \nWhen the CH4/air ratio increased from 1:6 to 1:1, the methanol \nconcentration in 48 h increased from 0.13 mg/mL to 0.28 mg/mL, but \nno further increment of methanol concentration was obtained when \nCH4/air ratio increased to 2:1 (Fig. 3e). This result was also consistent \nwith previous studies by Kalyuzhnaya et al. [18], who pointed out that \nthe entire CH4 conversion process relied on CH4 and O2 via the enzyme \n(MMO), and imbalanced CH4 and O2 supply would reduce the CH4 \nconsumption leading to lower methanol concentration. In addition, it \nwas found that the methanol accumulation reached a plateau at 48 h, \nwhich could be due to the limited amount of formate in the medium. \nThe effect of phosphate addition, formate addition, and CH4/air ratio \non CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency is further presented in Fig. 3. \nSimilar to the results in Fig. 2, the highest CH4 to methanol conversion \nefficiency was observed at 50 mmol/L of phosphate addition, 100 \nmmol/L of formate addition, and CH4/air ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 3). Statistical \nanalysis revealed that 50 mmol/L of phosphate addition significantly (p \n< 0.05) increased the CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency (increased \n1.29–13.16-fold) in comparison with other two trials with different \nphosphate addition (Fig. 3b). While 100 mmol/L of formate addition did \nnot show a significant (p > 0.05) increase in CH4 to methanol conversion \nefficiency compared two 150 mmol/L and 200 mmol/L of formate ad­\nditions (Fig. 3d). It was noted that the CH4 to methanol conversion ef­\nficiency with 50 mmol/L of formate addition was 0 since no methanol \nwas accumulated at the termination (Fig. 3d). There were significant \ndifferences in CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency between CH4/air \nratios of 2:1, 1:1 (or 1:2, or 1:4) and 1:6 (p < 0.05), but no significant \ndifference between CH4/air ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 (p > 0.05) \n(Fig. 3f). The maximum CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency of 0.22 \nmol/mol is comparable to that obtained by Methylosinus trichosporium at \nthe same CH4/air ratio [6,41].",

In addition, it \nwas found that the methanol accumulation reached a plateau at 48 h, \nwhich could be due to the limited amount of formate in the medium. \nThe effect of phosphate addition, formate addition, and CH4/air ratio \non CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency is further presented in Fig. 3. \nSimilar to the results in Fig. 2, the highest CH4 to methanol conversion \nefficiency was observed at 50 mmol/L of phosphate addition, 100 \nmmol/L of formate addition, and CH4/air ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 3). Statistical \nanalysis revealed that 50 mmol/L of phosphate addition significantly (p \n< 0.05) increased the CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency (increased \n1.29–13.16-fold) in comparison with other two trials with different \nphosphate addition (Fig. 3b). While 100 mmol/L of formate addition did \nnot show a significant (p > 0.05) increase in CH4 to methanol conversion \nefficiency compared two 150 mmol/L and 200 mmol/L of formate ad­\nditions (Fig. 3d). It was noted that the CH4 to methanol conversion ef­\nficiency with 50 mmol/L of formate addition was 0 since no methanol \nwas accumulated at the termination (Fig. 3d). There were significant \ndifferences in CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency between CH4/air \nratios of 2:1, 1:1 (or 1:2, or 1:4) and 1:6 (p < 0.05), but no significant \ndifference between CH4/air ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 (p > 0.05) \n(Fig. 3f). The maximum CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency of 0.22 \nmol/mol is comparable to that obtained by Methylosinus trichosporium at \nthe same CH4/air ratio [6,41].",

However, excessive phosphate addition may also inhibit \nFDH (formate dehydrogenase) in HTMC, which would cause a decrease \nin methanol concentration under higher phosphate concentration [5]. \nThe effect of formate addition on methanol concentration has a \nsimilar tendency to that of phosphate addition (Fig. 3c). The maximum \nmethanol concentration of 0.23 mg/mL was obtained with a formate \naddition of 100 mmol/L in 48 h (Fig. 3c). When formate addition \ndecreased to 50 mmol/L, a peak methanol concentration of 0.16 mg/mL \nwas obtained in 24 h and then decreased to 0 in 48 h (Fig. 3c). Higher \nlevels of formate addition (150 mmol/L and 200 mmol/L) didn’t further \nincrease the methanol concentration, obtaining peak methanol con­\ncentrations of 0.18 mg/mL and 0.11 mg/mL, respectively (Fig. 3c). \nThese results were also consistent with other reports on conversion of \nCH4 to methanol by Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b [39,40]. When \nMDH is inhibited for methanol accumulation, exogenous formate will \nfunction as an additional electron donor to provide electrons for cell \nactivity [6], but too high formate could be toxic to cells as well. \nWhen the CH4/air ratio increased from 1:6 to 1:1, the methanol \nconcentration in 48 h increased from 0.13 mg/mL to 0.28 mg/mL, but \nno further increment of methanol concentration was obtained when \nCH4/air ratio increased to 2:1 (Fig. 3e). This result was also consistent \nwith previous studies by Kalyuzhnaya et al. [18], who pointed out that \nthe entire CH4 conversion process relied on CH4 and O2 via the enzyme \n(MMO), and imbalanced CH4 and O2 supply would reduce the CH4 \nconsumption leading to lower methanol concentration. In addition, it \nwas found that the methanol accumulation reached a plateau at 48 h, \nwhich could be due to the limited amount of formate in the medium. \nThe effect of phosphate addition, formate addition, and CH4/air ratio \non CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency is further presented in Fig. 3. \nSimilar to the results in Fig. 2, the highest CH4 to methanol conversion \nefficiency was observed at 50 mmol/L of phosphate addition, 100 \nmmol/L of formate addition, and CH4/air ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 3). Statistical \nanalysis revealed that 50 mmol/L of phosphate addition significantly (p \n< 0.05) increased the CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency (increased \n1.29–13.16-fold) in comparison with other two trials with different \nphosphate addition (Fig. 3b).

It was noted that the CH4 to methanol conversion ef­\nficiency with 50 mmol/L of formate addition was 0 since no methanol \nwas accumulated at the termination (Fig. 3d). There were significant \ndifferences in CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency between CH4/air \nratios of 2:1, 1:1 (or 1:2, or 1:4) and 1:6 (p < 0.05), but no significant \ndifference between CH4/air ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 (p > 0.05) \n(Fig. 3f). The maximum CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency of 0.22 \nmol/mol is comparable to that obtained by Methylosinus trichosporium at \nthe same CH4/air ratio [6,41].\n\nOutput JSON list only:\nassistant\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"phosphate\",\n        \"relation\": \"inhibits\",\n        \"object\": \"methanol dehydrogenase\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"phosphate\",\n        \"relation\": \"prevents\",\n        \"object\": \"further oxidation of methanol\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"phosphate\",\n        \"relation\": \"inhibits\",\n        \"object\": \"formate dehydrogenase\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"formate\",\n        \"relation\": \"adds electrons to\",\n        \"object\": \"cell activity\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"formate\",\n        \"relation\": \"can be toxic to\",\n        \"object\": \"cells\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"CH4/air ratio\",\n        \"relation\": \"affects\",\n        \"object\": \"methanol concentration\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"CH4/air ratio\",\n        \"relation\": \"influences\",\n        \"object\": \"CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"CH4/air ratio\",\n        \"relation\": \"reduces\",\n        \"object\": \"CH4 consumption\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"methanol accumulation\",\n        \"relation\": \"reaches plateau at\",\n        \"object\": \"48 h\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"methanol accumulation\",\n        \"relation\": \"limited by\",\n        \"object\": \"formate amount in medium\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"50 mmol/L phosphate addition\",\n        \"relation\": \"significantly increases\",\n        \"object\": \"CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"100 mmol/L formate addition\",\n        \"relation\": \"does not significantly increase\",\n        \"object\": \"CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"CH4/air ratio 1:1\",\n        \"relation\": \"maximizes\",\n        \"object\": \"CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"CH4/air ratio 1:6\",\n        \"relation\": \"results in\",\n        \"object\": \"methanol concentration of 0.13 mg/mL\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"CH4/air ratio 1:1\",\n        \"relation"
