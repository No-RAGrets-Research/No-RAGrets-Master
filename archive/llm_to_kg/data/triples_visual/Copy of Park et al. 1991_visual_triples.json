Since raising the \nmedium nitrate concentration did not influence the fi- \nnal cell density (Fig. 6) and the metabolites present in \nthe spent bioreactor medium did not inhibit cell growth \n(data not shown), the maximal cell density attainable \nwith the medium in Table I (lacking CuS04) seems to \nbe determined by some component(s) other than the C, \n0, and N sources. In an effort to identify one such lim- \niting component, the effect of the culture medium Fe \nlevel was investigated (Table IV). When about half of \nthe usual Higgins medium Fe level (18 pmol/L) was \nemployed, whole-cell propene oxidative sMMO activity \ndecreased sharply from 105 nmol propene oxide \nformed/mg dry cell wt min to 47 nmol/mg dry cell wt \nmin at around 70 h. The cell density at that time was \n1.5 g dry wt/L, which was also about one-half of the \nfinal cell density achievable with the standard medium \nFe level of 40 pmol/L (Table I). When an additional \n50 pmol/L of Fe was supplemented at 90 h (total \n68 pmol/L), a normal high level of the sMMO activity \nwas restored within 24 h. Furthermore, cell growth \n( p  = 0.009 h-') continued up to 5.4 g dry cell wt/L \nwithout any appreciable decline in the whole cell enzy- \nmatic activity. This rapid and large Fe effect on the \nsMMO activity is not too suprising, considering that Fe \nis an essential cofactor for the sMMO enzyme complex \nwhich can represent more than 10% of the total soluble \nprotein in some methanotr~phs.'~*'~~~~ \nFrom the depen- \ndence of the final cell density on the initial medium Fe \nlevel, i.e., up to 40 pmol/L, it was possible to calculate \nthe cell yield on Fe as approximately 1.3 x lo3 g dry \ncell wt/g Fe. This is about five times lower than the \nvalue reported for Klebsiella aerogenes,** and it may be \nattributable to high Fe requirement for sMMO produc- \ntion by some methanotrophic bacteria. With an initial \nFe level of either 40 or 80 pmol/L, no sudden decreases \nin whole-cell sMMO activity were observed during the \nbioreactor batch cultivations, although the higher Fe\n\nOutput JSON list only:\nassistant\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"microorganisms\",\n        \"relation\": \"stop growing at\",\n        \"object\": \"end of cultivation\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"microorganisms\",\n        \"relation\": \"stop growing due to\",\n        \"object\": \"depletion of essential nutrients\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"microorganisms\",\n        \"relation\": \"stop growing due to\",\n        \"object\": \"accumulation of inhibitory metabolites\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"raising medium nitrate concentration\",\n        \"relation\": \"did not influence\",\n        \"object\": \"final cell density\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"metabolites in spent bioreactor medium\",\n        \"relation\": \"did not inhibit\",\n        \"object\": \"cell growth\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"medium in Table I\",\n        \"relation\": \"seems to be determined by\",\n        \"object\": \"some component(s) other than C, O, and N sources\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"effect of culture medium Fe level\",\n        \"relation\": \"was investigated\",\n        \"object\": \"to identify limiting component\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"Higgins medium Fe level\",\n        \"relation\": \"was reduced to\",\n        \"object\": \"18 pmol/L\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"whole-cell propene oxidative sMMO activity\",\n        \"relation\": \"decreased sharply from\",\n        \"object\": \"105 nmol propene oxide formed/mg dry cell wt min\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"whole-cell propene oxidative sMMO activity\",\n        \"relation\": \"decreased to\",\n        \"object\": \"47 nmol/mg dry cell wt min\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"whole-cell propene oxidative sMMO activity\",\n        \"relation\": \"decreased at\",\n        \"object\": \"around 70 h\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"cell density at 70 h\",\n        \"relation\": \"was\",\n        \"object\": \"1.5 g dry wt/L\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"standard medium Fe level\",\n        \"relation\": \"achieved final cell density of\",\n        \"object\": \"about one-half of 40 pmol/L\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"subject\": \"additional 50 pm"
