We \nhave also demonstrated the epoxidation of alkenes by \ncell-free soluble methane monooxygenase from a \nfacultative methylotroph, Methylobacterium sp. (Pa- \ntel et al. 1982), and an obligate methanotroph, \nMethylosinus sp. CRL 31 (Hou et al. 1982c). The \nepoxidation of propylene by this soluble methane \nmonooxygenase system using NADH 2 which was \nregenerated/generated by dehydrogenases and their \nsubstrates was also demonstrated (Hou et al. 1982c). \nFigure 1 shows the cofactor regeneration scheme for \nthe production of propylene oxide.",
