Major  sources  of  methanotrophs  include  agricultural  rice  fields, natural gas fields, dairy and cattle industries, etc. They are ubiquitous and are almost present wherever methane exists. India is an agriculturebased country with abundant paddy cultivation. Paddy cultivation is one of the largest sources in the global budget of methane emissions (Wang et al., 2022a). It is interesting to note that majority of methane (90 %) emitted in the wetland rice fields comes from the vascular transport system within the rice plants instead of ebullition or diffusion through the rhizosphere.

Thus,  they  are present in abundance in rice fields and they act as the main methane sink where they capture around 20 % of methane evolved due to decaying of water-logged  organic  matter  (Rahalkar  et  al.,  2021).

Results 3.1. Preamble: enrichment of rice field soil cultures Isolation  of  methanotrophic  bacteria  is  a  time-consuming  and tedious process. The methanotrophs are strongly associated with heterotrophic  satellites  around  them  in  their  community  (Dedysh  and Dunfield, 2011). So, the initial growth is often attributed to the growth of satellite bacteria growing on products from methanotrophic bacteria.

Since, the growth was also observed in control experiments within 3 days, which were not fed with methane, it can be inferred that initial growth attributes to the heterotrophic community and not the methanotrophs.  However, methanotrophic bacteria have been reported to grow in 4 -5 days from inoculation. Pure cultures are isolated bacteria that help in study of single species. In contrast, use of enriched culture has  economic  and  practical  advantage  over  pure  cultures.  Microbial consortium has more tolerance to potential contaminants in the feed gas (Jiang et al., 2023). So, the cost associated with the purification of feed gas  for  fermentation  can  be  significantly  reduced.  This  shows  that methanotrophic bacteria has better adaptability and applicability  towards changing environment while growing in a community (Han et al., 2013).

Discussion Methanotrophs efficiently convert methane to methanol in a single step using methane monooxygenase enzymes at ambient reaction conditions.  The  production  of  methanol  occurs  intracellularly  by  both pMMO  and  sMMO.  Extracellular  methanol  accumulation  is  usually achieved by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibition (Patel et al., 2016c).

The samples from initial culture and fifth day  enriched  cultures  were  taken  and  examined  for  the  presence  of methanol using gas chromatography. The methanol production in the pure strains of M. capsulatus and M. buryatense were also examined after 5 days of incubation (Fig. 2). It is very interesting to note here that these results are consistent with the gene detection results.

Conclusions Here, we have shown that the use of enriched cultures from rice field soil in place of pure cultures ( M. buryatense and M. capsulatus ) can also produce similar quantities (130 mM, 160 mM and 132.5 mM, respectively) of methanol. An added advantage of microbial cultures enriched from natural resources is that they are highly stable and robust against environmental variations,  which  makes  them  most  suitable  for  large scale operations.

A  major  problem  encountered  in  high  cell  density cultivation of this organism, is the solubility of methane in liquid medium. At high cell 2 densities,  the  availability  of  the  carbon  source  is  primarily  limited  by  mass  transfer  of gaseous methane to the aqueous phase. A potential solution to this problem is the use of a water  soluble  carbon  source.  Methanol  although  it  inhibits  growth  above  certain concentrations, is a good alternative due to its infinite solubility in water, and low cost. In addition, methanol is less flammable than methane and thus has less of a hazard for large scale use.

Attempts  to  promote  sMMO production by the addition of allylthiourea (15 µM) to the growth medium failed.  In lowcopper  containing  media  (<  0.01  ppm),  it  is  probable  that  allylthiourea  may  sequester other cations such as Fe 2+ that  are  required  for  sMMO production. Allylthiourea is not necessary  to  promote  whole  cell  sMMO  activity  of  cells  grown  under  copper  stress. However sMMO activity can be recovered in M. trichosporium OB3b by cultivating in a copper-free liquid NMS medium with methane (in excess)\n\nOutput: [('increased competition', 'for', 'carbon source'), ('methane', 'which', 'stimulates'), ('cells', 'to', 'produce'), ('more', 'sMMO', 'for'), ('survival')], [('59', 'SMMO', 'activity'), ('(umol)', 'naphthol/cell dry wt. - h)'), ('700', '600', '500'), ('400', '-', '300'), ('200', '100', '0'), ('Figure', '5-1:', 'Re",

The long response time (12 min) of the probe can be improved upon by increasing the gas permeability of the membrane. The probe provided a means of fine-tuning the yield of CO2 from methanol online, which was used  in  the  CCP  strategy  for  methanol  feeding.  The  CCP  strategy  was  effective  at providing an adaptive control of methanol concentration. Ammonium was inhibitory at concentrations  exceeding  5  mM  (0.09  g/L).

Methanotrophic bacteria, aerobic, and anaerobic Methanotrophic  bacteria  are  a  subgroup  of  so-called methylotrophic bacteria (methylotrophs), and they can utilize methane as their sole carbon and energy source (while the latter metabolize methanol). Methanotrophs can  catalyze  the  oxidation  of  methane  to  methanol  by using methane monooxygenases (MMOs) enzyme (Rhee et  al.  2019;  Lackner et al. 2022).

Methane oxidation The initial step in the oxidation of methane by aerobic methanotrophs is catalyzed by MMOs. These MMOs (Bo et al. 2023; Samanta and Sani 2023) represent classical monooxygenases that employ two reducing equivalents to cleave the O-O bonds of dioxygen, a process also noted by Lee et al. (2023) and Zhou et al. (2023). Within this process, one of the oxygen atoms undergoes reduction, ultimately resulting in the production of water   (H 2 O), while the other oxygen atom is integrated into methane, leading to the formation of methanol   (CH 3 OH). Two distinct forms of MMOs have been identified in methanotrophic bacteria (Shen et al. 2023).

Xylose, a frequently encountered C5 sugar in lignocellulosic biomass, holds significant potential as a versatile multi-carbon feedstock. Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z has demonstrated its ability to assimilate xylose as its sole carbon source through a strategic approach involving the integration of xylose metabolism pathways from Escherichia coli ,  in  combination with its native non-oxidative RuMP cycle. In E. coli ,  the enzyme xylose isomerase (encoded by xylA) converts xylose into d-xylulose. Subsequently, d-xylulose is phosphorylated by xylulokinase (encoded by xylB) to generate xylulose-5-phosphate (Xu5P). The conversion of Xu5P to ribulose-5-phosphate is then facilitated by ribulosephosphate 3-epimerase. A portion of this ribulose-5-phosphate is incorporated into the non-oxidative PPP.

Moreover, genome analysis has revealed that some type I methanotrophs may harbor putative gluconate kinase ( GntK ) and glucose-1-dehydrogenase ( gdh ) enzymes, the functions of which remain currently unknown (Rozova et al. 2021).

Despite the presence of redundant sugar metabolism pathways in obligate methanotrophs, the precise reasons for their inability to utilize glucose as a carbon and energy source for growth remain unclear. An intriguing observation is the absence of a phosphotransferase system for glucose transport in type I methanotrophs, which may hinder the uptake of glucose from the surrounding medium into the cells.

The first group is anaerobic methanotrophs which use hydrogen sulfide or other reducing agents as electron acceptors. The second group is aerobic methanotrophs which oxidize methane using molecular oxygen as the final electron acceptor. Both types play important roles in removing methane from environments contaminated with it.

Under the assayed reaction conditions, bacterial stress was shown to occur, but methanol was not responsible for this. Formate addition was necessary to start MeOH production.

This latter molecule has garnered growing interest as MeOH can be used as a precursor for plastic and fuel production. Since methanol is liquid at room temperature, it is safer and more convenient to store and transport than pressured gas. Industrial processes that convert CH4 to MeOH currently involve natural gas steam reforming followed by Fisher -Tropsch synthesis on the generated syngas. Several conversion processes exist, but these generally require pressures of around 30 bar and temperatures up to 1,000 ° C (Aasberg-Petersen et al., 2011; Soussan et al., 2016; Lee, 2019), which make them energy intensive. Moreover, these methods only allow partial selectivity and result in signi /uniFB01 cant CO2 emissions (Soussan et al., 2016; Bjorck et al., 2018).

MeOH production has been shown to be exogenous, i.e. , MeOH is accumulated in the external medium (Pen et al., 2014).

Formate exhaustion at t = 20 h under the reference condition, as seen in Figure 7A, may limit the MeOH production ability of M. trichosporium OB3b. Consequently, an assay was implemented with doubled initial formate concentration ([formate]×2), which induced lower MeOH accumulation over the /uniFB01 rst 20 h than under the reference conditions (Figure 7B). The MeOH concentration reached 226 ± 17 mg/L at 20 h in the [formate]×2 condition, equal to 42.2 µmol of methanol produced (Figure 7B). Meanwhile, the formate concentration decreased from 1.7 ± 0.0 to 1.1 ± 0.0 g/L, representing a consumption of 77.4 µmol (around 34% of the initial quantity, Figure 7B). Again, the consumed formate was around twice the quantity of MeOH produced under both the reference and [formate]×2 conditions.

These results are in agreement with a previous assay carried out at our laboratory (Pen et al., 2016), where a formate pulse containing the same amount of formate as that added to the RM initially was applied during reaction at 4.5 h ( i.e. , during the linear MeOH production phase). This formate pulse reduced MeOH production compared to the reference condition, suggesting a regulation process (Pen et al., 2016).

There were no observed limitations from gaseous substrates or nutrients during the reactions. The results of 13 C-NMR analyses showed that MeOH was produced only by direct CH4 oxidation without formate reduction. In the conditions tested in this work, MeOH was not cytotoxic to the bacteria, whereas the reaction conditions generally appeared to be stressful. Formate was mainly used as an electron donor for NADH regeneration. However, the mass balance calculations highlighted that only half of the NADH produced was devoted to MeOH production. Increasing the formate concentration did not improve MeOH production, hinting that there was metabolic regulation. Such biological phenomena need to be investigated further to possibly extend the methanol production time of M. trichosporium OB3b.

Our initial efforts focused on solubilizing the membrane preparations using surfactant so that the material could be incorporated homogeneously in the polymer. We found that any treatment of the membrane preparations with surfactant, including encapsulation in nanolipoprotein particles, led to a pronounced decrease in activity. This behaviour has been reported previously 11,17 and possible explanations include surfactant interference with activity, surfactant interference with the cofactor or disruption of the protein structure 16 . However, mixing the membrane fractions, either as prepared or extruded as liposomes directly with low concentrations of PEGDA 575, gave promising results. Therefore, we focused on optimizing the activity and protein retention of membrane preparations with PEGDA 575. A schematic of the method used to fabricate the PEG-pMMO hydrogels is shown in Fig. 1.

A simple cubic PDMS lattice with 250m m struts and 250m m spacing was printed using Direct Ink Write as described 56 to provide methane permeability throughout the PEG material and to provide mechanical support. A top layer of 50m m-thick PDMS was fabricated by spin-coating Dow Corning SE-1700 PDMS diluted in toluene on a hydrophobized silicon wafer. This thin PDMS membrane prevented leakage of liquid through the membrane but provided gas permeability. Two different flow cell geometries were fabricated using polycarbonate plastic: a flow cell for a higher surface area, thin lattice (1.25 cm wide by 3 cm long) and a lower surface area, thick lattice (1.25 by 1.25 cm).

The lattices were made hydrophilic by treating them in air plasma for 5 min, followed by storage in deionized water. To incorporate the pMMO into the lattices, a 10 vol% concentration of PEGDA 575 was mixed with membrane-bound pMMO to a final concentration of 5 mg ml /C0 1 pMMO. The pMMO/PEGDA mixture (200 m l) was pipetted into the lattice and cured with 365 nm ultraviolet light at 2.5 mW cm /C0 2 intensity for 4 min, forming the mixed polymer (PEG/PDMS) membrane. The final concentration of pMMO in the lattices was calculated, rather than directly quantified using a protein assay because of difficulties in quantifying the material in the lattice. The membrane was then loaded into the cell and rinsed with buffer to remove any unpolymerized material. The flow cell was placed on a hot plate calibrated with thermocouple so that the membrane would reach either 25 or 45 /C176 C.

Raising the Cuz+  concentration from 1 VM to 5 p~ effected a transition from soluble to particulate  MMO activity,  and  changes in  major  cell  polypeptides  were  observed  on SDSpolyacrylamide  gels. Organisms containing soluble MMO oxidized a wide range of  substrates including  n-alkanes,  n-alkenes,  aromatic  and  alicyclic  compounds.  By  contrast,  organisms containing  particulate  MMO  did  not oxidize  aromatic  or  alicyclic  compounds.  These observations provide further evidence that the two types of MMO are fundamentally different.

It was suggested  therefore,  that the availability of nitrate might determine the intracellular location of MMO (Scott et al., 1981 a,  b). Stanley et at.

The ability of MMOs from a number of methanotrophs to oxidize a wide range of substrates is well documented (Colby et al., 1977; Stirling et al., 1979; Higgins et al., 1979; Pate1 et al., 1980). These  substrates  include n-alkanes, n-alkenes and  ethers,  and  aromatic, alicyclic and heterocyclic compounds. Methylomonas methanica, however, appears to have a more restricted substrate range. The particulate cell-free MMO from this organism does not oxidize aromatic, alicyclic  and  heterocyclic  compounds (Stirling et  al., 1979).

DISCUSSION This work corroborates the finding of Stanley et al. (1983) that copper availability determines the intracellular location (soluble  or particulate) of MMO in M. trichosporium OB3b. This is also the case for Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) (Stanley et al., 1983). Research to date (Scott et al., 1981 a; Stanley et al., 1983)  has indicated that there are differences between soluble and particulate MMOs besides their intracellular location, which suggest that the particulate enzymes are not derived from the soluble  enzymes merely by membrane attachment. Our results support and extend previous findings. In both M. trichosporium OB3b and M. capsulatus (Bath) the inhibitor profile of  the soluble MMOs differs considerably from that of the particulate enzyme (Scott et al., 1981 a; Stanley et 3332 A.

This is supported by the recent observations of Leak & Dalton, (1983). Our findings show that the particulate MMO of M. trichosporium OB3b differs from the soluble enzyme in that it is unable to oxidize aromatic or alicyclic compounds (both enzymes oxidize methane, propene and n-alkanes). This suggests that the hydroxylase components of  the two enzymes are different, and provides a further important distinction  between the two types of MMO. It is of interest to note that the substrate specificity  of the particulate M M O   of Methj-lomonas methanica (Stirling et al., 1979) is the same as that reported  here for the corresponding enzyme from M. trichosporium OB3b.

Without medical intervention, the high serum concentrations of formic acid can cause respiratory and renal failure, coma and eventually death. In the late phase, the diagnostic hallmark of methanol poisoning is the presence of a high anion gap, osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis. These indicators are unfortunately not specific and can be caused by other conditions, for instance diabetic ketoacidosis or multiple organ failure (5). Thus, measurement of serum methanol, and ideally formic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is required to differentiate the cause of the patient's condition.

Previously published methods employed different sample preparation techniques, including direct injection, static and dynamic headspace or headspace injection using solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) (8, 9). Headspace GC (HS-GC) is now the most widely used technique for the detection of volatile organic compounds in biological fluids, mainly for its ability to detect trace levels of volatiles without the need for complex sample preparation. Formic acid is commonly analyzed after derivatization with methanol to methyl formate or with ethanol to ethyl formate under acidic conditions (6, 8, 10). HS-GC or HS-SPME-GC are the methods of choice, although other variations of these techniques have been employed (7, 11).

Formate determination by capillary electrophoresis has been reported, but despite excellent separation efficiency and short separation times, this method is limited to the analysis of small ions only and is rarely used in clinical laboratory practice worldwide (12). Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate methods for simultaneous determination of methanol and formic acid. The simultaneous measurement of toxic formic acid along with parent methanol is clearly desirable for both enhanced clinical service and the correct diagnosis. The goal of this work is simultaneous, simple and fast determination of methanol, ethanol and formic acid in biological specimens by headspace GC with flame ionization detection. Previously published methods for the determination of formic acid were based on its derivatization with an excess of either methanol or ethanol, which\n\nOutput: hydrogen peroxide; oxidizes glucose to gluconic acid; 30% H2O2 solution\nformaldehyde; reacts with aldehydes and ketones; 40% formalin solution\nsodium hydroxide; reacts with acids to produce sodium salts; 5% NaOH solution\npotassium permanganate; reduces oxides and peroxides; 70% KMnO4 solution\nhydrogen peroxide; oxidizes glucose to gluconic acid; 30% H2O2 solution\nformaldehyde; reacts with aldehydes and ketones; 4",

Introduction Methane  (CH4),  the  main  component  of  natural  gas,  biogas,  and shale gas, has been used as a significant energy source for a long time. In the past decade, its abundance and relatively low price have made CH4 a promising next-generation carbon feedstock (Fei et al., 2014). Nevertheless, the use of CH4  as a carbon feedstock is still limited because its conversion is hindered by an extremely stable C -H bound (440 kJ/mol of  the  dissociation  energy  of  the  C -H  bond)  (Bjorck  et  al.,  2018). Although the conversion of CH4 with chemical catalysts has been studied extensively, most of the reactions involved are energy intensive and ecologically unfriendly (Wang et al., 2017). Methanotrophs, a group of microorganisms, utilize CH4  as the sole carbon and energy source, with their unique enzymes and\n\nOutput: [('Methane', 'main component of natural gas', None),\n ('Methane', 'biogas', None),\n ('Methane', 'shale gas', None),\n ('Methane', 'energy source', None),\n ('methane', 'abundance', 'long time'),\n ('methane', 'low price', 'promising next-generation carbon feedstock'),\n ('methane', 'conversion', 'hindered by an extremely stable C-H bound'),\n ('methane', 'C -H bond', 'dissociation energy of the'),\n ('methane', 'C -H bond', '44",

This property of methanotrophs allows them to be used as biocatalysts for the conversion of CH4 into valuable products at ordinary temperature and pressure, supporting the development of green bioprocesses. Many methanotrophic bioprocesses have been applied to obtain various products, such as methanol (Patel et al., 2020a, 2020b), polyhydroxyalkanoates (Pieja et al., 2011; Strong et al., 2016), single-cell proteins (Petersen et al., 2017; Zha et al., 2021), liquid biofuels (Furutani et al., 2014), succinic acid (Subbian, 2017), and isoprenoids (Jeon et al., 2019). Even though additional market-valuable products could be synthesized, methanotrophic bioprocesses still face multiple challenges. For instance, the low water solubility of CH4  and oxygen (O2) is one of the major factors limiting the development of industrial  processes  (Bjorck  et  al.,  2018).

Hence, vigorous agitation in the form of bubbling or stirring is required to  dissolve  CH4 and  O2 into  the  aqueous  phase  to  supply  them  to methanotrophic cells, resulting in high energy consumption. Microbial gas-phase reactions have been proposed to enhance the rate of mass transfer of gaseous substrates from the gas phase to biocatalysts, especially for hydrophobic gases (e.g., CH4 and O2) (Kulishova & Zharkov,  2017;  Webb,  2017).  Unlike  in  typical  bioreactions  in aqueous solutions, for gas-phase reactions biocatalysts are immobilized on solid supports in the absence of an aqueous solution as a suspension medium. The removal of the aqueous solution allows biocatalysts to directly contact hydrophobic gases, and mediate biocatalytic reactions in the gas phase. Without the need for vigorous agitation, gaseous substrates can be driven by a small pressure drop or be supplied in a passive way with low energy consumption.

In a previous study, we evaluated the ability of Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative gammaproteobacterial methanotroph (Ward et al., 2004), to degrade CH4  in microbial gas-phase reactions. Notably, the rate of CH4 degradation in a gas-phase reaction without active supply of gases was much higher than that in an aqueous phase reaction, with stirring (Chen et al., 2020).

This process is catalyzed by methanotrophic bacteria such as Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), which oxidizes methane into carbon dioxide and hydrogen. These bacteria play a crucial role in the global carbon cycle by converting methane, a potent greenhouse gas, into less harmful substances like carbon dioxide and water. Methane is considered one of the most significant contributors to climate change due to its high heat-trapping capacity. However, it's important to note that while methane has a large warming potential, it also serves as a natural buffer",

Therefore,  depletion  of  Gln  and  Asp  might  limit  the metabolic flux toward purine synthesis, except for the pathway leading to xanthine and hypoxanthine. The derivatives of xanthine and hypoxanthine have been studied for a long time in the food and pharmaceutical  industries  due  to  their  biological  activities.  Their  efficient bioproduction from glucose has been accomplished using metabolically engineered  microbes  (Liu  et  al.,  2020;  McKeague  et  al.,  2016).

This  phenotype  is suitable  for  efficient  bioproduction.  Indeed,  for  most  valuable  compounds, bioproduction is coupled with cell growth, although biomass formation consumes a large part of the carbon source. To address this problem, efficient bioprocesses that decouple cell growth and production  have  been  developed  using  metabolic  engineering  approaches (David et al., 2016; Gupta et al., 2017; Soma et al., 2017, 2014; Soma & Hanai, 2015; Zhao et al., 2018).

The  gas-phase  reaction operated in the GPR improved the methane degradation rate, which was about 30-fold higher than that in an aqueous phase reaction, and triggered remarkable alterations in the metabolism of cells in the gas-phase reaction.

Compared to carbon dioxide   (CO 2 ),   CH 4 is 25 times more potent at trapping radiation; thus, the emission of   CH 4 to the atmosphere causes severe global warming and climate change. To mitigate   CH 4 emissions and utilize them effectively, the direct biological conversion of   CH 4 into liquid fuels, such as methanol   (CH 3 OH), using methanotrophs is a promising strategy.

Results An inverse membrane bioreactor (IMBR), which combines the advantages of gas-phase bioreactors and membrane bioreactors, was designed and constructed for the bioconversion of   CH 4 into   CH 3 OH in this study. In contrast to the conventional membrane bioreactor with bacterial cells that are immersed in an aqueous phase, the filtered cells were placed to face a gas phase in the IMBR to supply   CH 4 directly from the gas phase to bacterial cells. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath), a representative methanotroph, was used to demonstrate the bioconversion of   CH 4 to   CH 3 OH in the IMBR. Cyclopropanol was supplied from the aqueous phase as a selective inhibitor of methanol dehydrogenase, preventing further   CH 3 OH oxidation.

Although    CH 4 bioconversion  shows  great  potential as an economical GTL technology, it still faces some difficulties in achieving efficient conversion for commercialization. One of the difficulties occurs due to the low solubility of   CH 4 and oxygen   (O 2 ) in water. Since the conventional methanotrophic process is generally conducted in the aqueous phase [8-13], the limitation of the amount of dissolved   CH 4 results in a low productivity of   CH3OH. Although various configurations of bioreactors for methanotrophic reactions have been proposed to enhance the process of dissolving   CH 4 in the aqueous phase, such as stirred tank reactors and bubble-lift reactors [14-16], the process consumes high amounts of energy to deliver gaseous substrates to the cells by stirring or bubbling.

In contrast, biotransformation of methane to methanol would require less energy input, be more selective and productive. This process is carried out by whole cells of methanotrophs under mild conditions with a 100% atom economy (Anatas and Warner, 2000; Trost, 1995). The methanol accumulates in the medium provided that suitable methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibitors such as phosphate (Mehta et al., 1987), cyclopropanol (Sugimori et al., 1995), or a high concentration of NaCl (Lee et al., 2004) or CO2 (Xin et al., 2004) are added to the reaction system. In addition, sodium formate is generally added to supply NADH for methane oxidation as well as to prevent further oxidation of methanol (Perdeep et al., 1991). Copper at a concentration of 1.0 l mol/L is also beneficial to cell growth and methane transformation (Markowska and Michalkiewicz, 2009). Takeguchi et al.

In addition, higher cell concentrations ranging from 1.3 to 3.9 g dry cell/L did not accumulate more methanol if the phosphate concentration was less than 120 mmol/L.

To optimize methanol accumulation, further experiments are planned, including the optimization of operation conditions (operation mode, gas pressure, and flow rate), the effect of membrane materials and its structure, and the gas-liquid volumetric mass transfer coefficient of methane and oxygen. 4. Conclusions This study indicates the significant potential of microorganisms to produce high concentrations of methanol at a high methane conversion rate in anaerobic bottles and bubble free membrane aerated stirring tank reactors. To obtain high methanol yields, it was found that reactions should be conducted at higher cell density in the presence of high concentrations of MDH inhibitor. The maximum methanol accumulation achieved was over 1.12 g/L; 4.5-fold higher than the highest value (0.25 g/L) reported\n\nOutput: organic compounds, such as acetic acid, butyric acid, and valeric acid, were detected in the fermentation broth. The concentration of these compounds decreased significantly during the course of the experiment. The production of acetate was observed to increase gradually until reaching a peak after about 7 days of cultivation. However, the production of butyrate and valerate showed an initial rapid increase followed by a gradual decrease. The total amount of organic acids produced increased linearly with time up to day 7, after which there was a slight decline. The growth of bacteria was monitored using optical density measurements, while the metabolic activity was assessed through",

CH4 is 25 to 84 times more potent GHG over 20 years than CO2 due to its strong radiative forcing (Allen, 2015; Isaksen et al., 2011; Neubauer, 2014; Pachauri & Mayer, 2015; Solomon et al., 2007). While CO2 is the main focus, due to its substantial amounts that is produced yearly, CH4 plays a significant factor as well with several initiatives being set in place to reduce its emissions (Nisbet et al., 2020; Shindell et al., 2012). Up to 63% of the atmospheric CH4 originates from human activity with 6875 million metric tons being released into the atmosphere every year (Solomon et al., 2007). Excess CH4 in the industry is mostly burned for energy production. This further contributes to the accumulation of climate active gas in the atmosphere.

However, with upcoming reductions in government funding through the EEG, there will be a shift towards alternative, nonenergy usage (FNR, 2019; OIES, 2019). For one of those alternative applications, methane should be considered a valuable source of both carbon and energy for methanotrophs. Methanotrophic microorganisms are capable of metabolizing CH4 for diverse purposes, including biomass, methanol, or biopolymer formation, as documented in literature (Foster & Davis, 1966; G ę sicka et al., 2024; Helm et al., 2006; Karthikeyan et al., 2015; Whittenbury et al., 1970).

This capability provides a significant advantage over other methanotrophs, allowing for the cultivation of M. capsulatus without the need for additional nitrogen sources in the medium. Understanding the impact of varying nitrogen levels and exploring growth dynamics in the absence of nitrogen in the culture broth (e.g., potential reductions in growth or increases in product formation) is crucial for optimizing these processes (Pieja et al., 2012). The combination of screening for diverse microorganisms and optimizing cultivation processes is essential to successfully achieve the outlined objectives.

Furthermore, serum flasks, which are not continuously gassed, exhibit a dynamic change in gas composition over time. This varying gas composition poses additional challenges in comparing serum flasks results to large -scale experiments. Cultivating methanotrophic bacteria poses an additional challenge, primarily attributed to the necessary gas composition utilized for aeration. While oxygen ( O2 ) is a common gas for aeration, CH4 is not, due to its possible explosive nature in combination with O2 . Working with CH4 requires special safety precautions if both O2 and CH4 are used in the same process.

The available O2 is increasingly used for energy conversion, instead for biomass formation. With further increasing biomass and a stable gas consumption, the O2 per CH4 ration increases further. Towards the end of the cultivation, a ratio slightly above 2.0 O2 per CH4 (see Equation 7) is reached.

Introduction Greenhouse gases (GHGs), mostly CO2, methane and nitrous oxide, are the main drivers of climate change. The emission of all GHGs needs to be targeted but reducing methane emissions would bring the biggest benefits in a short-time frame. Methane has a global warming potential (GWP100) 27-30 times stronger than CO2, meaning that 1 kg of emitted methane has 27-30 more climate effect than 1 kg of CO2 in a 100 year time frame [1, 2]. Removing atmospheric methane and reducing anthropogenic methane emissions by 30% is one of the ambitious but urgently needed tasks for slowing climate-change progression.

The general idea for such biofiltration systems is to capture methane emissions and convert them into CO2, with minimal biomass production to prevent the system from bio-clogging. However, keeping microbes in an active methane utilization stage with limited biomass production is challenging and often results in an unstable system. Microbial methane oxidation provides cell carbon, energy, and water release by two pathways: Q1. CH4 + 2O2 = CO2 + 2H2O (oxidationenergy) Q2. CH4 + O2 = CH2O + H2O (assimilationbiomass). The ratio between the pathways will differ in response to nutrient availability or environmental conditions (e.g. pH/salinity/temperature or oxidative stress). About 50% of the methane consumed is oxidized. Environmental stressors (high or low pH, salinity, and temperature) will shift the methane flux toward oxidation for energy generation.

Mathematical model The model used for the column in the LEAFs design employs a matrix of loosely packed hydrogel spheres seeded with M. alcaliphilum 20Z R cells. Based on this matrix preparation, the simple mathematical model uses one basic building block: a 7 mm sphere (measured with a ruler) coated by a monolayer of methanotrophs. The predicted behavior of any assemblage of such spheres is then obtained by multiplying the expected uptake from a single sphere by the number of spheres. At a diameter of 7 mm, each sphere has a surface area of 4 π r 2 = 1.5 cm 2 .

Based on consultations with a colleague in the coal mining industry, it was assumed that power requirements for maintaining equivalent VAM gas flow would be increased by 10% to account for the minor VAM gas obstruction presented by the LEAF reactor, adding 5.4 million kWh of electricity use per year in each scenario. Estimated power consumption was calculated by taking known VAM gas flow power consumption from a coal mine within the same region, and linearly scaling to the match the flow rate used in this study. No supplemental heating or cooling was assumed to be provided to the LEAF reactor, assuming that VAM gas temperature was sufficient to meet the needs of the reactor. In different parts of the world, using different methane gas sources, this assumption may need to be revisited with additional LCA work.

Introduction The  epoxidation  of alkenes  (Colby et al. 1977; Higgins  et  al.  1979; Hou  et  al.  1979a;  Patel et  al. 1979) and the  hydroxylation of  alkanes  (Patel et  al. 1980b;  Hou et  al. 1981b)  by  methylotrophic bacteria in  both  whole cells and cell-free systems  have been reported. Methane monooxygenase  requires a  cofactor, NADH2, for  catalyzing both  the  epoxidation of alkenes  and the  hydroxylation of  alkanes. Obligate methanotrophs  cannot  utilize compounds with carbon-carbon bonds. The product epoxides accumulate extracellularly. In  whole  cell systems, the  epoxidation of  alkenes  and the  hydroxylation of  alkanes  do not require an exogeneous  supply  of  cofactor, NADH  2 (Hou  et  al. 1979a). When the  cofactor is depleted, the epoxidation or hydroxylation stops. Previously, we reported the  stimulation of  epoxidation by methane metabolites\n\nOutput: [('NADH2', 'cofactor', 'regeneration'), ('methanol', 'cosubstrate', 'bioreactor'), ('epoxidation', 'catalyzing', 'alkenes'), ('hydroxylation', 'catalyzing', 'alkanes'), ('methylotrophic bacteria', 'utilize', 'compound with carbon-carbon bonds'), ('methane monooxygenase', 'requires', 'cofactor NADH2'), ('whole cell systems', 'do not require', 'exogeneous supply of cofactor NADH2'), ('epoxidation', 'stop', 'de",

Methane is the primary component  in  natural  and  shale  gas  up  to  95%.  Thus, methane  has  attracted  much  attention  as  the  alternative chemical feedstock on the positive aspect, but in addition to  being  a  greenhouse  gas  25-times  more  harmful  than carbon  dioxide  [12].  Methane  is  the  resource  of  power stations at present and can be used as a basic raw material [19].  However,  methane  is  difficult  to  transport  from production sites in remote locations to the place where it is to be consumed,  since methane  is  a gas  at  ambient temperatures (boiling point: -164 o C) [20]. Conversion of methane to methanol has attracted enormous interest  because  methanol  is  easy  to  handle  and  has  a higher\n\nOutput:satisfaction with their work.

In this work, we produced methanol from  methane  using  whole  cells  of Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  as  the  biocatalyst. M. trichosporium OB3b was cultured on NMS medium with a supply of 7:3 air/methane ratio at  30 o C.  The  optimal  concentrations  of  various  methanol  dehydrogenase  inhibitors  such  as potassium phosphate and EDTA were determined to be 100 and 0.5 mM, respectively, for an efficient production of methanol. Sodium formate (40 mM) as a reducing power source was added  to  enhance  the  conversion  efficiency.  A  productivity  of  49.0  mg/l·h,  titer  of  0.393 g methanol/l, and conversion of 73.8% (mol methanol/mol methane) were obtained under the optimized batch condition.

As an alternative, direct biological methods can be employed to convert methane to methanol. Biological  conversion  is  more  selective  and  requires  less energy since bioconversion is conducted at ambient temperatures  [6].  Methane-to-methanol  conversion  using methanotrophic cells as the biocatalysts has been conducted to replace the chemical process [5, 13]. In metabolic assimilation of methane in methanotrophs, methane is converted to methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO). Methanol is converted to formaldehyde by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), which is then oxidized to formate and finally to carbon dioxide [15]. Thus, methanol is not a final  product  and  is  readily  converted  to  formaldehyde, which  is used  to synthesize cell  biomass via ribulose monophosphate  (RuMP)  or  the  serine  pathway  [10].

However, the storage, transportation, and distribution of biogas are costly since the energy density of biogas is low [6,7]. Additionally, biogas is a potent greenhouse  gas,  which  could  cause  environmental  problems  if  not properly treated or utilized [8,9]. One approach to address this issue is to upgrade biogas to methanol which is a promising energy carrier for long-term storage and a valuable precursor for the production of fuels and chemicals [10]. Bio-conversion of CH4 to methanol is attractive for the cleaner process,  milder  operating  conditions,  and  less  biogas  purification  requirements than thermochemical conversion methods [11]. In nature, methanotrophs can grow by using CH4  as the sole carbon and energy source, acting as a CH4 sink to suppress its emission to the atmosphere [12 -14]. In cells of aerobic methanotrophs [14], the conversion of CH4 to methanol is catalyzed by methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzyme (equation (1)), and methanol\n\nOutput: facts = [\n    ('United States', 'is part of', '[4,5]'),\n    ('storage', 'of', 'biogas'),\n    ('transportation', 'and', 'distribution'),\n    ('costly', 'since', 'the energy density of biogas is low'),\n    ('greenhouse', 'gas', 'potent'),\n    ('environmental', 'problems', 'could be caused'),\n    ('approach', 'to address', 'this issue'),\n    ('upgrade', 'biogas', 'to methanol'),\n    ('methanol', 'is', 'a promising energy carrier'),",

H2S has inhibitory effects on cell growth of methanotrophs following an inhibition competitive mode, because the gene encoding particulate MMO (pMMO) was related to competitive inhibition [13,22,23]. Compared to costly physicochemical H2S removal methods  for  biogas  application  with  extra  energy  input,  biological method  with  H2S  tolerated  methanotrophic  bacteria  (like  whole-cell biocatalysts [24]) attracted more attentions due to mildly and directly conversion of biogas without H2S removal [11,25].

As  a  result,  further  transcriptomic  studies,  especially  on  SQR,  could possibly reveal the mechanism of the\n\nOutput: three elements for each triple:\n\n(subject, relation, object)\n\n[\n    (\"protein\", \"by\", \"disulfide disruption\"),\n    (\"protein\", \"peroxidation\", \"lipid\"),\n    (\"cellular response\", \"to\", \"H2S toxicity\"),\n    (\"E. coli\", \"genes\", \"related to H2S tolerance\"),\n    (\"A. baumanni\", \"genes\", \"related to H2S tolerance\"),\n    (\"Bacillus subtilis\", \"genes\", \"related to H2S tolerance\"),\n    (\"Staphylococcus aureus\", \"genes\", \"related to H2",

Biogas  produced  from  organic  waste  via  anaerobic  digestion  is  a renewable and abundant CH4  source, but is costly to store, transport, and distribute [6,7]. Methanotrophic microorganisms can be used as cellular factories for converting CH4  gas into methanol, an alternative liquid  fuel,  which  has  desirable  energy  density  and  easy-to-transport [46]. One challenge to the microbial biogas-to-methanol approach is that H2S in biogas can inhibit methanotrophic microorganisms, and H2S removal is usually energy-intensive and costly [46]. The HTMC obtained in this study addressed this hurdle for its high H2S tolerance, specifically the ability to grow and produce methanol with up to 5.64 g/m 3 of H2S in biogas. For future applications of this technology, raw biogas can be directly  used  for  methanol  production  without  H2S  removal  process. Besides, evaluation of factors that affect HTMC cell growth and methanol production also provides base-\n\nOutput: sentences = [\n    ('high', 'H2S tolerance', 'HTMC'),\n    ('Biogas', 'produced', 'from organic waste via anaerobic digestion'),\n    ('is', 'a', 'renewable and abundant CH4 source'),\n    ('but', 'is', 'costly to store, transport, and distribute'),\n    ('Methanotrophic microorganisms', 'can', 'be used as cellular factories for converting CH4 gas into methanol'),\n    ('methanol', 'gasoline', 'has desirable energy density and easy-to-transport'),\n    ('One', 'challenge', '",

Conclusions A high H2S-tolerant methanotrophic  consortium,  HTMC,  was enriched from anaerobic digestion effluent with high H2S stress (5.64 g/ m 3 ). There was no significant decrease in cell yield and CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency of HTMC when H2S concentration in the headspace was increased from 0 to 5.64 g/m 3 . With a H2S concentration of 5.64 g/m 3 in the headspace, the HTMC achieved a cell yield of 0.285 g cells/g CH4 and a CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency of 0.203\n\nOutput: [('High H2S-tolerant methanotrophic consortium', 'HTMC', 'enriched'), ('H2S concentration', 'increased', 'from 0 to 5.64 g/m 3 '), ('cell yield', 'decreased', 'no significant decrease'), ('CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency', 'improved', '0.203')] Here's how I arrived at the output:\n\n1. \"A high H2S-tolerant methanotrophic consortium, HTMC, was enriched from anaerobic digestion effluent with high H2S stress (5",

The maximum cell to CH4 yield (0.333 g cells/g CH4) and maximum CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency (0.22 mol/mol) were obtained through evaluating the effects of environmental factors on cell growth and methanol production. Microbial community analysis revealed that sulfide oxidizing bacteria may have a limited contribution to the high H2S tolerance of HTMC due to their low abundancies ( < 0.01% -0.13%), and high H2S tolerant methanotroph(s) could exist in the consortium. Besides, Cyanobacteria is the most predominant phylum (32.61%) in the HTMC, indicating a great potential for simultaneous utilization of CH4 and CO2 from raw biogas.

BSM and FM22 media are observed to have a lower EE, which indicates that the extraction is impacted by the presence of various salts present in the media. One of the most important parameters that can affect the extraction is the pH of the sample. 40 Hence, the pH variations between the different media are expected to influence the final extraction yield. Overall, the extraction efficiencies were found to be in the same order of magnitude, irrespective of the matrix, and indicate proximity to the values estimated from the calibration curve. However, to obtain a high precision on the quantification, it is advised to use a similar matrix as the samples for measuring the calibration standards to achieve a similar EE.

The technique established through this study can be easily applied to biological samples with minimal volumes of the sample and solvent. Moreover, this process will allow a fast analysis of the volatile components considered, which makes it convenient to use for routine analysis. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that it can be applied to matrices that are used in P. pastoris fermentation processes. The recovery of the analyte after such a processing step was good and showed good reproducibility and linearity for actual samples retrieved from bioprocesses. To the author's knowledge, such a technique for analyses and quantification of methanol and ethanol found in yeast fermentation has not yet been investigated and is therefore envisaged to be an alternative for laborious or expensive techniques required for routine analysis. ■ ASSOCIATED CONTENT * sı Supporting Information The Supporting\n\nOutput: URLs are provided for each document associated with the content.

The gas phase in the two-phase flow between parallel plates (Figs. 1 and A1) is most often observed as long ' pancake ' type bubbles.

The choice of scaling parameters reflects the level of intricacies and introspection into a (bio)chemical process operation that a user wants to achieve. The scaling parameters may often vary with space (position in the reactor) and time (in unsteady operations). In these cases, scaling parameters appear to have distributed values.

The concept of CO2 fixation by methanotrophs first emerged following the discovery a new methanotroph species that produces methanol from CO2 through the Calvin-BensonBassham (CBB) cycle in the Verrumicrobia phylum. However, this species is a thermophilic methanotroph that inhabits high-temperature environments, such as volcanoes and hot springs; thus, it cannot be widely used for CO2 fixation [25-27].

In other words, NADH is required to reduce CO2 to formaldehyde, and pyrroloquinoline quinol (PQQH2) is needed to reduce formaldehyde to methanol [25-28].

Reduced NAD + is converted to NADH and can be used as a reducing agent that can donate electrons. This electron transfer reaction is the main function of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD). NADH reduces another molecule (CO2 in our study) and is re-oxidized to NAD + . Thus, the reaction is reversible. This suggests that coenzymes are not consumed, and that NAD + and NADH can continuously alternate between the two forms [36]. In our previous study, methane is oxidized by MMO to produce methanol, and methanol oxidation continues to form NADH when formate is finally converted to CO2 by the formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzyme [36].

As continuous supply of formate will increase CO2 emission, effect of CO2 on MMO and FDH activity need to be investigated. Globally, methanol is produced from fossil based feedstocks like coal and natural gas. Both these feedstocks require a twostep process of methanol production involving syngas generation and conversion of syngas to methanol. Multi-step processes based on syngas to methanol require metal catalyst, high temperature and pressure conditions along with cleaning of syngas leading to large capital and operating expenditure (40). A biotechnological route based on methanotrophic organisms can provide a milder and safer fermentation-based technology for methanol production from sustainable feedstocks like biogas.

Conversion of CO2 to methanol can be achieved using immobilized cultures of methanotrophs as reported in previous studies (5). Other approaches like co-culture of methanotrophs with cyanobacteria can also be a promising way to utilize maximum carbon present in the biogas.

Tel: 91-431-2503423 Fax: 91-431-2500133, Email id: anandachu@nitt.edu Abstract . Methane is available in abundance as natural and renewable gas. Methane-rich biogas has low power density so cannot be considered as a good substrate for the microbial fuel cell. The power density of methane-rich biogas can be increased by its conversion to methanol.

Biological conversions are generally more attractive than thermochemical conversions [5]. A diverse group of bacteria commonly known as methanotrophs uses monooxygenase (MMO) for the oxidation which converts methane to methanol. These bacteria consume two reducing equivalents for the oxidation of a single molecule of methane. Normally, formate dehydrogenase (FDH), methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), and formal dehydrogenase (FalDH) further result in oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide (CO2) w hich generates reducing equivalents of six per molecule of methanol. That's why, production of methanol with methanotrophs is accomplished by the use of MDH inhibitors such as phosphate and sodium chloride (NaCl), and usually provides external electron donors which are generally formatted to carry out the metabolic activity and survival of methanotrophs [5].

From the results obtained it was found that copper concentration in the medium influences the rate of bacterial biomass growth or methanol production during the process of methane oxidation to methanol.

Oxygen was used as an oxidant. Primary difficulty encountered during the direct partial oxidation of methane to methanol with high yield is associated with the activation of the methane C-H bond. Methane is quite inert so traditional approaches require quite high temperatures, where chemistry is dominated by radical pathways and is determined by the C-H bond strength. The first dissociation energy in methane is as high as 440 kJ mol -1 . The required product (methanol) is much more active under these reaction conditions. Dissociation energy of the C-H bond in CH 3 OH is 393 kJ mol -1 . At high temperatures methanol is easier to be activated and oxidized than methane, leading to deep oxidation resulting in CO and CO 2 (Berndt et al., 2000). Many publications on partial oxidation of methane at high pressures (1 MPa) have been published.

At lower pressures (0.1 MPa), the catalyst plays a crucial role in the partial oxidation of methane. In most cases, the reactions were carried out at temperatures higher than 500 ◦ C and HCHO was obtained as a partial oxidation product (Foulds et al., 1993; Brown & Parkyns, 1991; Otsuka & Hatano, 1987).

The disadvantage of this method is the use of strong acids and the two stages of the method. First, methane is oxidized to ester and then methanol is obtained by hydrolysis. The one-step method performed at a very low temperature (35 ◦ C) relies on the methane oxidation to methanol by bacteria. In nature there are some kinds of bacteria with the unique ability to oxidize methane as the sole source of carbon and energy. Methanothropic bacteria, or methanothrophs, are a subset of a physiological group of bacteria known as methylotrophs.

The first two enzymes involved in methane oxidation are methane monooxygenase MMO and methanol dehydrogenase MDH.

This hypothesis is confirmed by the studies of other authors (Harwood & Pirt 1972; Wilkinson & Harrison, 1973). It results from these studies that the growth of bacteria from a group of obligate methanotrophs to which the Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b strain can be classified, may limit even small amounts of methanol added to the nutrient medium.

Today a number of alternate strategies for methane conversion, which engage nitrate, sulfate, or three metal oxides to fulfill oxygen's functions, are being discussed. Below, the cost of each conversion is estimated based on the current prices of the nutrients required for methane oxidation. Aerobic methane conversion requires an oxygen input with at least a 1:1 methane to oxygen ratio. Oxygen is widely available, but it is a pricy feedstock. The cost of oxygen is directly linked to energy cost (mostly electricity) and might vary from $100 to $125 per ton. 27 That estimation would bring the cost of aerobic methane conversion to at least $200-$250 per one ton of methane (Figure 13.1).

The ANMO-SR mode is directly linked with the formation of volatile sulfur compounds, such as H 2 S. This mode of methane oxidation would not be feasible for technological applications unless a sustainable solution for conversion of H 2 S back to sulfate or elemental sulfur is found.

Hence, there has been a resurgence in interest in methanotrophs, which are able to use methane as a sole energy and carbon source under mild growth conditions (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015; Lee et al., 2016). These strains have great potential as a platform strain for the utilization of methane for chemical production, and also in the mitigation of climate change via removing methane as greenhouse gas (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015; Strong et al., 2016a). There are different groups and types of methanotrophs depending on the three different pathways primarily employed by methanotrophs to assimilate  formaldehyde  into  biomass:  the  Ribulose  monophosphate (RuMP) pathway occurring in Group I methanotrophs (Gammaproteobacteria, Type I and Type X), the serine cycle of Group II methanotrophs A B S T R A C T Methane,  the  predominant  element  in  natural  gas  and  biogas,\n\nOutput: information. The RuMP pathway occurs in Group III methanotrophs (Bacteroidetes, Chloroflexi, Planctomycetes, Firmicutes, Actinobacteria, and Verrucomicrobia), while the serine cycle occurs in Group IV methanotrophs (Archaea). In addition, some methanotrophs can utilize other organic compounds such as acetate or formate as substrates instead of methane (Strong et al., 2016b).\n\nThe conversion of methane is problematic because it requires a significant amount of energy to break the strong C-H bonds in",

Methanotrophs, methane-utilizing bacteria, can make a significant contribution to the production of various valuable biofuels and chemicals from methane. Type II methanotrophs in comparison with Type I methanotrophs have distinct advantages, including high acetyl-CoA flux and the co-incorporation of two important greenhouse gases (methane and CO2), making it a potential microbial cell-factory platform for methane-derived biomanufacturing.

First,  this  group  has  a  comparably  high  flux  of  CoAderivatives,  such  as  acetyl-CoA,  propionyl-CoA,  and  crotonyl-CoA, which  could  be  used  for  biofuel  production  (Bordel  et  al.,  2019b; Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2013). Second, a typical Type II methanotroph (e.g. M. trichosporium OB3b) can assimilate significant amount of CO2  (Yang et al., 2013). Type II methanotrophs are appropriate biocatalyst for biogas conversion because of their ability to coutilize  methane  and  CO2.  Third,  many  Type  II  methanotrophs  have broad-spectrum  substrates  that  can  assimilate  from  C1 to  C2  and  C3 compounds, which\n\nOutput: [('UHVHUYHGg', 'ALRWHFKQRORJ\\\\', 'mb'), ('mb', 'iyeyT', 'Tebbee Feedstock Technology Products D.T.N.

The soluble methane monooxygenase  (sMMO)  (mostly  present  in  Type  II  more  than  Type  I methanotrophs) can catalyze both the oxidation of methane and the transformation of a wide spectrum of aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons and their derivatives (Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008). Thus, sMMO can play an important role in the bioremediation of polluted environments as well as biocatalyst for biotransformation (Dalton, 2005; Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008). Moreover, most of Type II methanotrophs have been shown to be capable of nitrogen fixation, while only some Type I methanotrophs have such capability (Auman et al., 2001; Stein, 2018; Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008).

Furthermore, Type II methanotrophs employ the glutamate cycle with glutamine synthetase and glutamine-oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GOGAT) system for NH4 assimilation, whereas Type I methanotrophs assimilate NH4 predominantly  via  reductive  pyruvate  or α -ketoglutarate  amination (Trotsenko  and  Murrell,  2008).  The  GOGAT  of  Type  I  is  peculiar  to NADPH and is quite unsteady, while this enzyme is more stable in Type II methanotrophs and specific for NADH cofactor (Trotsenko and Murrell, 2008). Another advantage of methanotrophs is their ability to utilize either nitrate or ammonium as a nitrogen source, where the growth rate  of  methanotrophic  bacteria  is  affected  by  the  nitrogen  source.

For methane oxidation, type II methanotrophs are expected to employ the redox arm mechanism where pMMO takes electrons from ubiquinone/ubiquinol pool of the methanol oxidation process, resulting in lower biomass yields than Type I methanotrophs possessing the direct coupling system where electrons from methanol oxidation are directly transferred to pMMO (Akberdin et al., 2018; Bordel et al., 2019b).

This model serves as a specialized database for investigating methane metabolism in alphaproteobacteria (Naizabekov & Lee, 2020).

To produce 3-HP from glycerol, the glycerol metabolism  in K.  pneumoniae and E.  coli could  be  applied  by  expressing glycerol dehydratase, which catalyzes the conversion of glycerol to 3hydroxypropionaldehyde, and aldehyde dehydrogenase, which subsequently converts 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde to 3-HP (Raj et al., 2008).

The goal is to identify subject, predicate, and object within each sentence and compile them into a structured format such as a triple. This process requires understanding the context and meaning of sentences to determine which parts are subjects, predicates, and objects. Once identified, these components can be organized into a coherent set of triples that represent the knowledge contained in the original text. To accomplish this task, one must carefully analyze the text and make judgments about what constitutes a subject, predicate, and object based on their roles in conveying information.

The direct hydration of ethylene is accomplished at 250-300 °C and 70-80 atm in the presence of steam [4]. The requirement of high temperature and high pressure causes an increase in production cost [5]. In the case of bioethanol fermentation, one molecule of glucose produces two molecules of bioethanol with release of two molecules of CO2.

At low  concentrations  of  copper,  sMMO  is  expressed  and  catalyzes  methane  oxidation  using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as the reducing agent in the cytosol. At a high level of copper concentration, pMMO is expressed in the intracytoplasmic membranes and uses a reduced ubiquinone as the electron donor [10-12]. Some methanotrophs possess both sMMO and pMMO, and the expression of sMMO and pMMO is regulated by copper concentration. Cells expressing pMMO have a higher growth rate due to the higher affinity of pMMO for methane [13,14]. Ethane is used for the production of ethylene by steam cracking.

This process is not accompanied by carbon dioxide emission since MMO converts  one  molecule  of  ethane  into  one  molecule  of  ethanol  in  mild  conditions,  which  is  an environmentally friendly approach compared to the chemical process [10,18].

A further increase of inhibitors over 0.3 mM EDTA or 300 mM phosphate resulted in a decrease of ethanol concentration. Cytochrome cL is  the  primary  electron  acceptor  of  MDH,  and  the  electron  is  expected  to  be  transferred  by  the coupling of lysyl residues on MDH surface and carboxyl groups of cytochrome cL. EDTA hinders the cytochrome from moving to the optimal position for the next electron transfer as it binds to MDH, which inhibits MDH activity [29].

The decrease of ethanol concentration in the presence of more than 300 mM phosphate could be due to the depression of pMMO catalytic activity by intolerable phosphate concentrations [31]. The production of ethanol from ethane would be practiced on an enormous scale. The use of 300 mM phosphate as a means of retarding ethanol oxidation is not practical because of limited global phosphate reserves and environmental contamination [32]. We concluded that the addition of 0.3 mM EDTA was the most suitable alternative for efficient ethanol accumulation. Figure 4.

Introduction Methanotrophs are microbes that utilize methane (CH4) for growth and produce numerous value-added bioproducts such as methanol, 2,3-butanediol, ectoine, lactic acid, and biopolymers [1,2]. In recent years, the analysis of methanotrophic pathways and their metabolic engineering has significantly expanded to produce bioproducts from CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) as greenhouse gases (GHGs) [3,4]. Methanol production by methanotrophs can be beneficial over CH4 as an energy source due to its ~400 times higher density. Methanol can readily be transported or stored under ambient conditions compared with CH4. [5]. Methane monooxygenases (MMOs) catalyze CH4 to methanol in methanotrophs.

Conclusions The use of renewable energy sources derived from GHGs is a suitable GHG mitigation strategy. In this study, the use of Cu- and Fe-based NPs proved beneficial for the growth of methanotrophs as inocula in converting simulated biogas to methanol. Furthermore, polymeric-matrix- and NP-based encapsulation systems of methanotrophs exhibited significantly higher residual methanol production than the control. The cells encapsulated within a polymeric matrix containing CuFe2O4 exhibited superior methanol production stability under repeated batch recycling. The addition of CH4 vectors during bioconversion by encapsulated cells resulted in high methanol production potential and retained better recycling stability. These findings suggest that polymeric matrices and NPs are desirable for high methanol production from simulated biogas.

Introduction Methane constitutes a large carbon feedstock that can potentially be used for the production of valuable oxygenated liquid products such as methanol or formic acid (Caballero and Perez, 2013). Developing processes that allow the selective hydroxylation of methane, i.e., its conversion into methanol, is thus of great interest. The high stability of its C-H bonds makes methane remarkably inert, however, and despite recent progress, its chemical activation remains unselective and highly energy consuming (Alvarez-Galvan ⇑ Corresponding author.\n\nOutput: facts = [\n    ('batch reactor', 'type', 'Membrane bioreactor'),\n    ('batch reactor', 'avoidance', 'gas bubbles'),\n    ('batch reactor', 'avoidance', 'dangerous gas mixtures'),\n    ('obtained productivity', 'higher than', 'only other MBR reported'),\n    ('methane', 'carbon feedstock', 'valuable oxygenated liquid products'),\n    ('methane', 'conversion', 'methanol'),\n    ('methane', 'chemical activation', 'unselective and highly energy consuming'),\n    ('methane', 'C-H bonds', 'remarkably inert')",

Regarding the mass transfer between the gas phases and the liquid containing the bacteria, it should be enhanced to avoid any substrate limitation.

In the case of batch reactors (Duan et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2004), the headspace is commonly filled with a substrate mixture containing a large methane excess to avoid explosion. In such reactors, the effective mass transfer area, which corresponds to the physical contact surface between gas and liquid, is relatively small and may limit the transfer. This notably explains why continuously sparging the gaseous substrates directly into the bacterial suspension constitutes a usual way of feeding to prevent any substrate depletion (Kim et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2004; Markowska and Michalkiewicz, 2009).

Moreover, the biocatalyst concentration can be also identified as a key parameter for methanol production once there is no substrate limitation.

The latter phenomenon has been already observed by Coutte et al., 2010 for surfactant production. When washing the modules, we noticed that bacteria were adsorbed on the surface of the hollow fibers and the observation was completed by OD600nm measurements in the bioreactor. However, in our case, the OD600nm of the suspension measured at 6 h was the same as the initial value. So the initial substrate limitation observed was certainly due to very rapid substrate consumption during the first hours of the bioreaction. After 6 h, the dissolved oxygen concentration rose to 5.0 ± 0.1 mg L /C0 1 , which is lower than the saturated oxygen concentration. The fact that the dissolved oxygen did not reach the saturated concentration (6.2 ± 0.1 mg L /C0 1 ) may be attributed to adsorption on the membranes as 33 ± 4% of the bacteria\n\nOutput: sentences = [\n    ('substrate consumption', 'very high', 'reasons'),\n    ('mass transfer', 'dramatically decreased', 'reasons'),\n    ('plugging', 'bacteria', 'adsorption'),\n    ('observation', 'completed', 'by'),\n    ('OD600nm', 'measurements', 'bioreactor'),\n    ('initial substrate limitation', 'observed', 'during the first hours of the bioreaction'),\n    ('dissolved oxygen concentration', 'rose', 'to 5.0 ± 0.1 mg L /C0 1'),\n    ('saturated oxygen",

Moreover, with a lower biocatalyst concentration (11 u ml /C0 1 ), the dissolved oxygen concentration was equal to the saturation value even though a similar adsorption was observed (35 ± 4% of the bacteria were adsorbed after 22 h). The fact that the catalytic concentration was 6.4-fold higher at 70 u m /C0 1 than at 11 u ml /C0 1 induced a 9-fold higher mass concentration in this case, which could explain why adsorption had an effect on the mass transfer at 70 u ml /C0 1 and not at 11 u ml /C0 1 . In conclusion of this study on the influence of the biocatalyst concentration, as methanol production kinetics were similar for all the concentrations tested, the minimum biocatalyst concentration tested (11 u ml /C0 1 ) can be considered the most attractive since it limits the quantity of bacteria used. 4.

One of these oxygen atoms oxidizes methane into methanol, whereas the other gets hydrogenated to produce water. The oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde releases PQQH2 and the oxidation of formaldehyde to CO2 via formate releases NADH. NADH thus generated is reutilized by MMO for the oxidation of methane to methanol (Xin et al., 2007).

MASS TRANSFER AND SOLUBILITY LIMITATIONS IN METHANOTROPH BASED GAS FERMENTATION Commonchallenges associated with gas fermentation systems are gas-to-liquid mass transfer limitations and lower solubility of the gaseous substrates. Researchers have outlined the role of certain physico-chemical parameters like partial pressure, and extrinsic approaches like reactor configurations and mass transfer vectors to address these limitations. Bioreactors help in achieving higher gas-to-liquid mass transfer rates as compared to other culture systems, facilitating easier and higher uptake of gases by the cells. Bubble column reactors have been predominantly used for cultivation systems where the objective is to replace mechanically driven stirring and to reduce the shear-stress on the cells. They are suitable for application when the requirement is to maintain directional flow and circulation, efficient mass transfer and heat transfer, especially while working with gas fermentation\n\nOutput: facts = [\n    ('mass transfer', 'limitations', 'gas fermentation'),\n    ('gas fermentation', 'common challenges', 'gas-to-liquid mass transfer limitations and lower solubility of the gaseous substrates'),\n    ('physico-chemical parameters', 'role', 'partial pressure'),\n    ('extrinsic approaches', 'to address', 'reactor configurations and mass transfer vectors'),\n    ('bioreactors', 'help achieve', 'higher gas-to-liquid mass transfer rates'),\n    ('bubble column reactors', 'used for', 'cultivation systems'),\n    ('objective', 'is to replace', 'mechanically",

While high partial pressures do result in increased solubility of the gases, they might interfere with the growth or product formation metabolism resulting from the interaction of the gaseous substrate with the key enzymes (Hurst and Lewis, 2010). In a study outlined by Soni et al.

Production of methanol from the methanotrophic reduction of CO2 appears to be a promising alternative in this regard. The current state-of-the-art technology for the production of methanotrophic high-value products, is constrained by low product titer and productivity.

Introduction Overpopulation and economic development have led to increased greenhouse gas emissions since the beginning of the pre-industrial era, resulting in unprecedented levels of atmospheric methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide (CO2) concentrations. The consequent effect has been reflecting through global climate change and enhanced global warming since the mid-20th century. Worldwide anthropogenic emission of CO2 has almost hit 43.1 billion tonnes (Global Carbon Project Budget, 2019). Methane has a global warming potential 28 -36 times that of CO2 over a 100-year-timescale (US EPA, 2020). Furthermore, the global emission of methane stands at 570 million tonnes, of which 342 million tonnes is accounted for by anthropogenic sources, while the residual 228 million tonnes  originate\n\nOutput: links = [\n    ('Institute of Technology and Management (GITAM) University', 'Visakhapatnam', 'Andhra Pradesh'),\n    ('Institute of Technology and Management (GITAM) University', '530045', 'India'),\n    ('Introduction', 'Overpopulation', 'economic development'),\n    ('Introduction', 'increased greenhouse gas emissions', 'pre-industrial era'),\n    ('Introduction', 'global climate change', 'enhanced global warming'),\n    ('Keywords', 'Methanotrophs', 'Bio-methanol'),\n    ('Keywords', 'Methane', 'Carbon dioxide'),",

There have been initiatives on methanol production via MMO (soluble and particulate) catalysed biological oxidation of methane (Mardina et al., 2016; Patel et al., 2016a, 2020a). However, MDH and other enzymes cause subsequent sequential oxidation of the produced methanol  into  intermediate  metabolites  and  CO2,  resulting  in  decreased extracellular methanol accumulation (Sheets et al., 2016). To that end, various  MDH  inhibitors  ( e.g. ,  NaCl,  NH4Cl,  phosphate,  EDTA,  and MgCl2) are supplemented in the fermentation media to increase methanol  production  (Patel  et  al.,  2016a;  Sheets  et  al.,  2016).  Although, particulate MMOs are also involved in the methanol production metabolism, but they do not require any cofactors for their activity. On the other hand, soluble MMOs require natural co-factor (NADH) regeneration for their activity and increased methanol accumulation. However, the MDH inhibitor-induced inhibition of\n\nOutput:-transcriptional regulation of genes encoding for MDH is responsible for the decrease in methanol production. The authors suggest that this phenomenon can be overcome by using MDH inhibitors with high affinity towards MDH. In addition, it has been observed that the use of different types of MDH inhibitors may result in varying degrees of methanol production enhancement. For instance, the use of NaCl or NH4Cl alone resulted in an increase in methanol production, while the combination of these two inhibitors led to a significant increase in methanol production. Furthermore, the use of MgCl2 or EDTA alone did not significantly enhance methanol production,",

Further,  the  model  provided  an  insight  into  the dissolved methane concentration profile (Fig. 5) as one of the key outputs, thereby offering an easy alternate solution to energy intensive and expensive experimental methods (Aldhafeeri et al., 2020). As the gas was  continuously  sparged  throughout  the  batch  run,  the  overall methane  concentration  initially  increased  and  reached  a  saturation value, beyond which it was approximately constant (Fig. 5). A decrease in the concentration of dissolved methane was observed from 21 h to 100 h, implying a higher substrate uptake rate due to the exponential growth phase of the bacteria. 3.3.2. Kinetic modelling for the second stage For the second stage of the model, batch data with 50% CO2 (Fig. 6a) in the headspace was used for the estimation of model parameters.\n\nOutput: information retrieval system, search engine, web browser\nThe given text does not contain any factual triples.

An initial lag phase of approximately 3 h in methanol production was observed in all the three batch experiments. This lag phase may be attributed to the delayed induction in the mass transfer of CO2 from headspace to the liquid phase (Fig. 6). Beyond the initial lag phase of 3 h, a gradual decrease in headspace CO2 concentration was predicted till the end of the batch (Fig. 6).

The dissolved CO2 concentration eventually became zero, at which point the methanol production was also seen to be saturated. 4. Conclusions Two-stage integrated bioprocess was demonstrated for bio-methanol synthesis using M. trichosporium coupled with sequestration of methane and carbon dioxide. Improved biomass titer, methane fixation rate and methanol titer  was  achieved  via  optimization  of  process  parameters. Semi-batch stirred tank reactor used in the first stage addresses the key challenge  of  mass  transfer  limitation  of  methane  from  gas  to  liquid phase.  Methanol  titer  in  the  second  stage  was  found  to  be  critically dependent on the partial pressure of carbon dioxide in the headspace of batch reactor. A kinetic model was developed to capture phenotypic response of the methanotroph under varying process parameters.

Therefore, the conversion of methane and CO2  into methanol adopt different routes. While the methanol production from biological oxidation of methane requires higher MMO activity coupled with the inhibition  of  MDH  activity;  methanol  production  from  biological reduction  of  CO2  requires  higher  activity  of  formate  dehydrogenase, formaldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  methanol  dehydrogenase,  without any  involvement  of  MMO.  MMO  oxidises  methane  into  methanol. Hence, the activity of MMO in presence of methane has been correlated to  methanol  production,  since  the  methanol  titer  decreases  with  the decrease in MMO activity (Patel et al., 2020a, 2020b). However, the presence of CO2  is known to shift the equilibrium of methanotrophic metabolic  reaction  in  reverse  direction,  thereby  rendering  the ' irreversible enzyme MMO ' non-functional (Sahoo et al., 2021).

For instance, Patel et al. (2020b) reported 1.7-fold increment in methanol production by adding methane vectors to methanotrophic culture as compared to control. Similarly, Patel et al. (2023) reported a residual methanol production efficacy of 28.3 % in presence of paraffin oil as methane vector, as compared to 13.4 % in control, after 6 cycles of biomass reuse. Moreover, the supplementation of methane vectors has shown to enhance the biocatalytic activity of MMO. For instance, Patel et al.

The presence of draft tube in an airlift  reactor  divides  the  vessel longitudinally into riser and downcomer sections. Bubbles rise inside the riser section causing vertical flow of the liquid in upward direction. This upward force exerted in the riser section is counter-balanced by vertical downflow of the liquid inside the downcomer section (Duan and Shi, 2014). The up-flow and downflow of the liquid result in efficient circulation and mixing of the liquid. Improved liquid circulation imparts a uniform velocity to the bubbles causing them to traverse in uniform direction.

It also mentions that the draft tube is placed in the airlift reactor to achieve these improvements. Additionally, it explains how the draft tube works by dividing the vessel longitudinally into riser and downcomer sections. The riser section causes bubbles to rise vertically, while the downcomer section causes downward flow of the liquid. This results in efficient circulation and mixing of the liquid, which leads to uniform velocity of the bubbles and consequently minimizes the probability of bubble collisions. Duan and Shi, 20",

In the present study, the elevation of operating pressure up to 4 bar resulted in further 3.4-fold increment in methanol production as compared to the previous report.

Use of micro-sparger, engagement of draft tube and supplementation of mass transfer vector in airlift reactor addressed the key challenge of mass transfer and solubility limitations of methane in the first stage. Biomass titer, biomass productivity and methane fixation rate were improved by 126 %, 143 % and 148 %, respectively, compared with the two-stage process without process engineering strategy. In the second stage, elevation of headspace pressure in reactor increased CO2 solubility, leading to 235.6 % increment in methanol titer, relative to atmospheric pressure.

Two of the most important sources of those CH4 emissions are landfills (20%) and manure management sites (8%) [1,2], where anaerobic microorganisms convert organic wastes to biogas (30-70% CH4, 30-70% CO2, 0-2000 ppm hydrogen sulfide (H2S)) that is released directly to the atmosphere [1].

The purpose of this work was to develop a trickle-bed reactor (TBR) to improve mass transfer of CH4 and oxygen (O2) to methanotroph growth media for enhanced CH4 oxidation and methanol production. Mass transport of O2 in a TBR packed with ceramic balls was nearly two-fold higher than an unpacked TBR. CH4 oxidation in the TBR (0.4-0.6 mmol/h) was about four times higher than that in shake flasks that used similar inoculum and headspace:volume and biogas:air ratios. Using optimal operating parameters (biogas:air = 1:2.5, 12 mmol formate addition, 3.6 mmol phosphate), methanol productivity (0.9 g/L/d) from the non-sterile TBR was among the highest reported in the literature.

At the same biogas:air ratio (1:2.5) and a lower formate level (6 mmol), methanol production peaked at 4 h (0.14 g/L), but declined rapidly thereafter (Fig. 4b).

However, Phase 2.2 revealed some issues that need to be addressed prior to scale up. Unstable methanol production after day 20 was presumably because formate and methanol-consuming microbes became prevalent in the TBR.

Studies of the model Type II methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b have provided insight into multiple aspects of methanotrophy, including methane assimilation, copper accumulation, and metal-dependent gene expression. Development of genetic tools for chromosomal editing was crucial for advancing these studies. Recent interest in methanotroph metabolic engineering has led to new protocols for genetic manipulation of methanotrophs that are effective and simple to use.

INTRODUCTION Methanotrophic bacteria are unique in their ability to utilize methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as their sole carbon source (Hanson & Hanson, 1996). In the first step of their metabolic pathway, methane is oxidized to methanol, which can be utilized as a cheap carbon feedstock for industrial chemical processes (Lawton & Rosenzweig, 2016). For this reason, there have been extensive efforts to understand methanotrophy in multiple species of bacteria. Most aerobic methanotrophs are classified as Type I (Gammaproteobacteria) or Type II (Alphaproteobacteria) based on their use of either the ribulose monophosphate or serine cycles for carbon assimilation,\n\nOutput: [('methanotrophic bacteria', 'unique', 'in their ability to utilize methane'), ('methane', 'oxidized', 'to methanol'), ('methanol', 'utilized', 'as a cheap carbon feedstock for industrial chemical processes'), ('Type I', 'ribulose monophosphate cycle', 'carbon assimilation'), ('Type II', 'serine cycle', 'carbon assimilation')] Here's how we arrived at these triples:\n\n1. \"methanotrophic bacteria\" -> \"unique\" -> \"in their ability to utilize methane\": This triple captures the key fact that methanotrophic bacteria possess an",

Methane is oxidized to methanol by methane monooxygenase enzymes (MMOs), followed by methanol conversion to formaldeyhde by methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs). There are two types of MMO, a soluble and cytoplasmic iron-containing enzyme (sMMO) and a 'particulate' and inner membrane-bound copper-containing enzyme (pMMO) (Ross & Rosenzweig, 2016). With the exception of the genera Methylocella and Methyloferula , aerobic methanotrophs express pMMO under most conditions (Semrau et al., 2010; Vorobev et al., 2011). Under copperstarved conditions, some Type I and Type II methanotrophs can switch to sMMOexpression(Semrauetal., 2010), and some Methylosinus and Methylocystis species also produce the copper chelator methanobactin (Dassama, Kenney, & Rosenzweig, 2017).

The first one is a type of bacteria called Methylobacterium which has been found to be able to break down cellulose and other complex carbohydrates into simple sugars through a process known as hydrolysis. Hydrolysis involves breaking down large molecules into smaller ones using enzymes such as cellulase and hemicellulase. These enzymes are produced by the bacteria and help them digest food more efficiently.

However, it is sometimes difficult to insert methanotroph genes, including those in the pmo operon, into this plasmid due to leaky expression at high copy number and subsequent toxicity of the product proteins in E. coli (Ojala et al., 2011). We have employed the following two strategies to circumvent this issue. First, we use the chemically competent E. coli strain CopyCutter EPI400 (Lucigen), designed to control plasmid copy number, to increase the success rate for cloning of methanotroph genes. However, the plasmid must then be incorporated into the E. coli donor strain S17-1 (Simon, Priefer, & P € uhler, 1983) for subsequent conjugation.

GENETIC MANIPULATION VIA CONJUGATION The most common and efficient method for genetic manipulation in methanotrophs requires conjugation (Lloyd et al., 1999; Murrell, 1994; Smith & Murrell, 2011). Typically after conjugation, the shuttle plasmid is incorporated into the chromosome of the recipient strain, followed by counterselection to ensure double recombination and removal of the vector backbone from the chromosome (Lalioti & Heath, 2001). In Ms. trichosporium OB3b, the established conjugation method involves the addition of liquid cultures of both methanotroph and E. coli cells onto a 0.2μ msterile filter paper for mating (Smith & Murrell, 2011).

Introduction 1.1. Sustainable methane from organic waste Methane is the second most abundant greenhouse gas after carbon dioxide. Methane has a global warming potential up to 86 times greater (measured over 20 years) than CO2, and is responsible for 0.48 W m /C0 2 of atmospheric radiative forcing (Howarth et al., 2011; IPCC, 2013; Shindell et al., 2009). Anaerobic microbial catabolism of organic substrates generates significant amounts of global methane. Typically, the substrate is converted into a soluble compound (hydrolysis) that is metabolised to generate organic acids (acidogenesis and acetogenesis). Acetic acid is transformed into biogas (methanogenesis) - a gas mixture composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide (Abbasi et al., 2012). Biogas production and capture is an established and sustainable strategy for treating organic waste. The scrubbed methane is used for generating electricity in gas turbines or steam\n\nOutput: compounds (hydrolysis), metabolised to generate organic acids (acidogenesis and acetogenesis), acetic acid is transformed into biogas (methanogenesis), gas mixture composed primarily of methane and carbon dioxide (Abbasi et al., 2012), generated electricity in gas turbines or steam\nTo extract the factual triples from the given text, I followed these steps:\n\n1.

The rapid expansion of the global market's access to methane, in the forms of natural gas and methane-rich biogas, has improved accessibility and lowered the commodity price. In recent times, there has been growing interest in the biological conversion of methane to fine and commodity chemicals due to economic drivers and the attitude towards sustainable alternatives for the production of these chemicals. Methane represents an enormous resource and opportunity for conversion into higher value products, especially if it can be sourced from stranded natural gas deposits that are not economical to process for conventional heating, or from sustainable point sources, such as high rate digesters or capped landfills.

While a secondary reactor adds to gas consumption and the reactor footprint, recycling the biomass could potentially offset gas usage - as methane could be directed towards product synthesis rather than biomass synthesis. Although SCP is a potential product, the relatively high residual ectoine content poses an unknown health risk for a feed supplement. Its effect on animal health has not been assessed and it may prove unsuitable.

Lipid synthesis in methanotrophs varies with varying salt content in growth media. At higher NaCl concentration phosphatidylglycerol content increases, while phosphatidylethanolamine content decreases. Methylomicrobium alcaliphilus 20Z grown at pH 9.0 in the presence of NaCl had a higher content of acid phospholipids and unbranched fatty acids than cells grown at pH 7.0 without NaCl (Khmelenina et al., 1997). The two-stage process presents an opportunity to harvest intact dead cells that house the pMMO and associated cell machinery with an internal content of ectoine that could stabilise the pMMO. This would represents a major fraction of the biomass (>80%) and render the process nearly free of organic waste disposal.

However, culture at pilot and commercial scale is still an unknown. While high salinity and pH offers some advantages, such as preventing fungal and microbial contamination, these conditions represent a number of technical hurdles (Section 3).

Methane  mono-oxygenase  (MMO)  catalyzes the  single-step oxidation of  methane  to  methanol  according to  the  following equation: Purified MMO is not  suitable in  methanol  synthesis reaction, because of  the  instability. Thus,  the  production of  methanol  from methane with methanotroph  was tried. When  the  cell suspension was treated by cyclopropanol, which  was an  irreversible inhibitor for  MDH,  it led  to  extracellular methanol  accumulation, as  shown in  Scheme 1 (1).

Key words: Carbon dioxide reduction, methane oxidation, methanol production, methanotrophic bacteria, reducing equivalent regeneration INTRODUCTION Methanol is used in the chemical industry in a variety of ways. Methanol is a building block for other chemicals. It can be used directly as an alternative fuel source, as antifreeze and as a precursor to other compounds. Methanol can be produced chemically via methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etcll-s) Synthesis of methanol from carbon dioxide has several obvious advantages.

So no formaldehyde or formic acid was observed in the CO, incubations. The oxidation of methane is catalyzed by methane monooxygenases (MMO), which are classical monooxygenases that utilize two reducing equivalents to split the O-O bonds of dioxygen. One of the oxygen atoms is reduced to form HO and the other is incorporated into methane to form CH,OH|3). In this study, methanol obtained from CO, reduction was accumulated and excreted out of the cells. The result led us to assume that the MMO is not able to catalyze the reverse reaction of the methane monooxygenation.

Direct oxidation of ethylene to epoxyethane with molecular oxygen is a significant synthetic method for both industry and academia. During the last decades, many research works have been focused on epoxidation reactions of ethylene by supported catalysts such as transition metal complexes and metal nanoparticles [3-6]. In contrast with chemical synthetic methods, the biocatalytic reaction appears to be a mild and simple method [7]. One biocatalytic method for producing epoxyethane is using enzymes to insert oxygen across the carbon double bonds of ethylene. Methane monooxygenase (MMO) is such a fascinating enzyme that can efficiently catalyze ethylene to ethylene epoxide with high region specificity and stereoselectivity [8, 9]. Epoxyethane synthesis by MMO catalysis has significant application potential as it is performed at normal temperature and pressure and causes no pollution.

Hou performed a gas-solid bioreactor to ensure continuous production and removal of product 2 Journal of Chemistry epoxide from the microenvironment of the biocatalyst [11].

Formaldehyde and formate completely inactivate cells in the second regeneration cycle. The results suggest that formaldehyde and formate are toxic to the Methylosinus trichosporium IMV3011 cells. In this work, formaldehyde and formate produce a positive effect under the best amendment condition (5 mmol/L formaldehyde, 10 mmol/L formate).

This result suggests that low concentration methane exerts a positive effect on NADH regeneration. In other words, after the initial oxidation step, methane may be further degraded to regenerate reducing NADH, which can promote further ethylene epoxidation. However, the positive effect was outweighed when the methane concentration was higher than 10% of the gas phase because of its inhibitory effect.

The production of epoxyethane from ethylene by cell suspension in the absence of methanol was nearly stopped when the batch reaction was repeated in the 6th batch cycle.

MMO plays a critical role in ethylene epoxidation, which has been found in methanotrophic bacteria. MMO requires a cosubstrate, NADH, for continuous catalysis of the epoxidation of ethylene. In whole cell suspension, when the cosubstrate is depleted, the epoxyethane production stops. Hence, stimulation of epoxidation by methane and its metabolites was investigated in this study. The main reason for the stimulation may be the provision of additional reducing power, or the reduced form of NAD + , for the MMO. Methane and methanol were postulated to be electrondonating cosubstrates since they do not result in toxicity and provide an abundant reductant for ethylene epoxidation.

It is produced by certain methanotrophs such as Methylosinus trichosporium when grown on methane under copper limitation but, due to its low aqueous solubility, methane cannot support dense biomass growth. Since it is water soluble, methanol may be a more attractive growth substrate, but it is widely believed that sMMO is not produced on methanol. In this study, when the growth-limiting substrate was switched from methane to methanol, in the presence of the particulate MMO inhibitor, allylthiourea, growth of M. trichosporium OB3b continued unabated and sMMO activity was completely retained. When allylthiourea was then removed, sMMO activity was maintained for an additional 24 generations, albeit at a slightly lower level due to the presence of 0.70 𝛍 Mof Cu 2+ in the feed medium.

The aforementioned limitations in bioreactor productivity were at least partly due to the low aqueous solubility of methane. As a carbon source, methane is first oxidized to methanol by MMO.

The first module of methanol oxidation can be catalyzed by three methanol oxidoreductases, differentiated by their electron acceptor: (i) pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ) -dependent methanol dehydrogenase (PMDH), (ii) NAD + -dependent methanol dehydrogenase (NMDH) and (iii) O2 -dependent alcohol oxidase (AOX). Among these, PMDH is the most complex as it requires the PQQ | prosthetic group to transfer electrons to cytochrome c . In Methylobacterium extorquens , the expression of up to 15 genes are required to realize its function (M. Zhang & Lidstrom, 2003; W. Zhang et al., 2017). Even in betaproteobacteria with monomeric PMDH (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2008), at least 4 -7 additional enzymes are still required to synthesize PQQ, which additionally requires molecular oxygen (Velterop et al., 1995).

However, the use of hydrogen peroxide also poses some challenges, such as the risk of producing free radicals that could damage cellular components. To address this issue, researchers have developed various strategies to minimize the formation of reactive species. One approach involves using catalysts or inhibitors to control the rate of the reaction. Another strategy is to modify the substrate structure to reduce the likelihood of side reactions.

ACT acts by removing the nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN) moiety of the NMDH -bound NAD + (Arfman et al., 1997; Wu et al., 2016), which increases the affinity of NMDH for methanol and NAD + (Arfman et al., 1991). Therefore, this simple two -component system is much easier to construct than the PMDH complex (Velterop et al., 1995). However, NMDH mainly exists in thermophilic Gram -positive methylotrophs (such as B. stearothermophilus and B. methanolicus ) and has a high Gibbs free energy ( Δ r G ʹ = + 34.2 kJ mol -1 ) (Whitaker et\n\nOutput: [(PMDH, enzyme, methanol oxidoreductase), (NMDH, enzyme, methanol oxidoreductase), (ACT, activator, protein), (ACT, function, removes nicotinamide mononucleotide), (NMDH, substrate, methanol), (NAD+, substrate, NAD+), (ΔrG', Gibbs free energy, +34.2 kJ/mol)], [(B. steathermophiles, organism, Thermophilic Gram-positive methylotrophs), (B. methanolicus, organism, Thermophilic Gram-positive methylotroph",

The third methanol oxidoreductase, AOX, is mainly found in eukaryotic methylotrophs such as P. pastoris . Although this oligomeric flavoenzyme alcohol oxidase has relatively low affinity for both methanol and oxygen, its Gibbs energy is much lower ( Δ r G ʹ = -99.2 kJ mol -1 ) than the other two enzymes (Cereghino & Cregg, 2000; W.

To improve NMDH activity and increase its affinity to methanol, two strategies have been tested. The first is to express an NAD -dependent but ACT -independent Mdh2 enzyme. Both directed evolution and protein engineering have been used to construct such a synthetic enzyme. For example, directed molecular evolution has resulted in a mutated version of CT4 -1 (A126V, A31V, A169V) which has a 6 -fold higher K cat /K m for methanol (9.3 M -1 S -1 ) and 10 -fold lower K cat /K m for n -butanol (48 M -1 S -1 ) in vitro (Wu et al., 2016).

Among these metabolic intermediates, formaldehyde is the most toxic to many microorganisms. Studies have shown that the growth defect of methylotrophic yeast ( Pichia methanolica ) on high methanol media is not caused directly by methanol toxicity, but rather by formaldehyde toxicity (Wakayama et al., 2016). To counter this toxicity, the formaldehyde dissimilation pathway can be activated to detoxify formaldehyde (Pfeifenschneider et al., 2017). These results suggest that the formaldehyde assimilation module may be the limiting step in methanol utilization (Papoutsakis et al., 1978). Therefore, the heterologous hosts must be engineered to either\n\nOutput: facts = [\n    ('ground', 'challenges', 'tolerance of metabolic intermediates'),\n    ('methanol', 'is', 'a promising carbon source'),\n    ('formaldehyde', 'is', 'toxic for cells'),\n    ('formaldehyde', 'is', 'the most toxic to many microorganisms'),\n    ('growth defect', 'of methylotrophic yeast', 'on high methanol media is not caused directly by methanol toxicity, but rather by formaldehyde toxicity'),\n    ('formaldehyde dissimilation pathway', 'can be activated to detoxify formaldehyde'),\n    ('formaldehyde assimilation",

Two approaches can be taken to reduce formaldehyde toxicity in methylotrophic strains. The first is to strengthen the efficiency of the formaldehyde dissimilation pathway. This strategy not only accelerates formaldehyde degradation, but also provides NADH which can be used for ATP generation. However, it leads to carbon loss in the form of CO2. The second approach is to convert formaldehyde into a less toxic compound. For example, in the AX pathway the affinity of dihydroxyacetone synthase (DAS, Figure 2) towards formaldehyde is much higher (Km = 0.43) (Kato et al., 1982) than that of AOX for methanol (Km = 3) (Nichols & Cromartie, 1980), which indicates that DAS may be well -suited for quickly relieving formaldehyde toxicity in synthetic microbes utilizing AX pathway for methanol oxidation. 4.2 Cofactor balance To overcome the thermodynamic constraint on methanol oxidation catalyzed by NMDH ( Δ r G' = 34.2\n\nOutput: [('strengthening', 'the efficiency of the formaldehyde dissimilation pathway', None),\n ('accelerating', 'formaldehyde degradation', None),\n ('providing', 'NADH', None),\n ('carbon loss', 'in the form of CO2', None),\n ('converting', 'formaldehyde into a less toxic compound', None),\n ('AX pathway', 'the affinity of dihydroxyacetone synthase (DAS)', 'much higher'),\n ('Km', 'for formaldehyde', '0.43'),\n ('Km', 'for methanol', '3'),\n ('indicating',",

One way to achieve this is to weaken other NAD + utilization pathways. For example, Meyer et al. has constructed an E. coli strain wherein methanol is essential for growth, by knocking out NAD + -dependent malate dehydrogenase and reducing the function of the NAD repressor nicotinamide mononuculeotide adenylyltransferase NadR (Meyer et al., 2018). These modifications led to a rebalance toward a high NAD + /NADH ratio, which thermodynamically favored | the oxidation of methanol. Another promising method is to build an NADH -ATP generation cycle. Since NADH can be transported into the mitochondria to generate ATP, enhancing the NADH shuttle system (i.e., malate -aspartate shuttle) (Eto et al., 1999) may be a good solution that is capable of not only promoting NAD + regeneration, but also providing additional ATP which can be used to further increase methanol utilization. 4.3 Energy\n\nOutput: [('methanol', 'essential for growth', 'knocking out NAD + -dependent malate dehydrogenase'), ('methyl alcohol', 'essential for growth', 'knocking out NAD + -dependent malate dehydrogenase'), ('malate dehydrogenase', 'NAD + -dependent', 'knocking out NAD + -dependent malate dehydrogenase'), ('NAD + -dependent malate dehydrogenase', 'NAD + -dependent', 'knocking out NAD + -dependent malate dehydrogenase'), ('NAD + -dependent malate dehydro",

This may be the reason why an NADH sink was necessary in a previous report of microbes expressing the NR pathway to metabolize methanol (Price et al., 2016). In contrast to the RuMP cycle, all other methanol -assimilating pathways have an energy demand. So far, two methods have been used to meet this energy demand. One is to strengthen the formaldehyde dissimilation pathway, which produces ATP from the generated NADH, although it can lead to > 40% carbon loss (Jorda et al., 2014). The formaldehyde dissimilation pathway generates 2 mol NADH in two enzymatic steps, which requires a very small proteomic investment and thus more proteomically efficient than glycolysis and the TCA cycle in generating protons for energy production.

The second method to meet the energy demand of methanol utilization is by adding other carbohydrates to the culture medium (Gonzalez et al., 2018; Meyer et al., 2018; Woolston, Roth, et al., 2018).
