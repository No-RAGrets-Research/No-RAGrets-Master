Keywords: biogas; greenhouse gases; encapsulation; methanol; methanotrophs; polymeric matrix 1. Introduction Methanotrophs are microbes that utilize methane (CH4) for growth and produce numerous value-added bioproducts such as methanol, 2,3-butanediol, ectoine, lactic acid, and biopolymers [1,2]. In recent years, the analysis of methanotrophic pathways and their metabolic engineering has significantly expanded to produce bioproducts from CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) as greenhouse gases (GHGs) [3,4]. Methanol production by methanotrophs can be beneficial over CH4 as an energy source due to its ~400 times higher density. Methanol can readily be transported or stored under ambient conditions compared with CH4. [5]. Methane monooxygenases (MMOs) catalyze CH4 to methanol in methanotrophs.

Conclusions The use of renewable energy sources derived from GHGs is a suitable GHG mitigation strategy. In this study, the use of Cu- and Fe-based NPs proved beneficial for the growth of methanotrophs as inocula in converting simulated biogas to methanol. Furthermore, polymeric-matrix- and NP-based encapsulation systems of methanotrophs exhibited significantly higher residual methanol production than the control. The cells encapsulated within a polymeric matrix containing CuFe2O4 exhibited superior methanol production stability under repeated batch recycling. The addition of CH4 vectors during bioconversion by encapsulated cells resulted in high methanol production potential and retained better recycling stability. These findings suggest that polymeric matrices and NPs are desirable for high methanol production from simulated biogas.
