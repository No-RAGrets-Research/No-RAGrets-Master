Therefore, the conversion of methane and CO2  into methanol adopt different routes. While the methanol production from biological oxidation of methane requires higher MMO activity coupled with the inhibition  of  MDH  activity;  methanol  production  from  biological reduction  of  CO2  requires  higher  activity  of  formate  dehydrogenase, formaldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  methanol  dehydrogenase,  without any  involvement  of  MMO.  MMO  oxidises  methane  into  methanol. Hence, the activity of MMO in presence of methane has been correlated to  methanol  production,  since  the  methanol  titer  decreases  with  the decrease in MMO activity (Patel et al., 2020a, 2020b). However, the presence of CO2  is known to shift the equilibrium of methanotrophic metabolic  reaction  in  reverse  direction,  thereby  rendering  the ' irreversible enzyme MMO ' non-functional (Sahoo et al., 2021).

The presence of draft tube in an airlift  reactor  divides  the  vessel longitudinally into riser and downcomer sections. Bubbles rise inside the riser section causing vertical flow of the liquid in upward direction. This upward force exerted in the riser section is counter-balanced by vertical downflow of the liquid inside the downcomer section (Duan and Shi, 2014). The up-flow and downflow of the liquid result in efficient circulation and mixing of the liquid. Improved liquid circulation imparts a uniform velocity to the bubbles causing them to traverse in uniform direction.

Conclusions A combinatorial process engineering strategy was employed to twostage  integrated  bioprocess  for  improved  methanol  production  using M. trichosporium .  Use of micro-sparger, engagement of draft tube and supplementation of mass transfer vector in airlift reactor addressed the key challenge of mass transfer and solubility limitations of methane in the first stage. Biomass titer, biomass productivity and methane fixation rate were improved by 126 %, 143 % and 148 %, respectively, compared with the two-stage process without process engineering strategy. In the second stage, elevation of headspace pressure in reactor increased CO2 solubility, leading to 235.6 % increment in methanol titer, relative to atmospheric pressure.

It can be used in various fields including healthcare, finance, marketing, etc. The main goal is to improve efficiency and accuracy in data analysis and decision-making processes. Information retrieval systems are designed to search through large amounts of data quickly and efficiently, allowing users to find specific information they need without having to manually sift through each piece of data. They use techniques like keyword matching, relevance ranking, and natural language processing to identify the most important pieces of information. Some popular examples of information retrieval systems",
