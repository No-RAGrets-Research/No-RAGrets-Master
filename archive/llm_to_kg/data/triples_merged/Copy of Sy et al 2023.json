Ethanol may be present at varying levels within the final product due to the fermentation process, so it is vital to have a validated method to meet regulatory, quality, and safety requirements.

This method will also evaluate the determination of methanol within the water kefir samples. Method: The matrix extension study was performed as per the AOAC INTERNATIONAL guidance documents outlined in Appendix K: Guidelines for Dietary Supplements and Botanicals using HS-GCMS for ethanol determination. Ethanol determination in each water kefir sample is quantified against an external standard calibration curve. The same instrumentation is used for methanol characterization. Results: RSDr and HorRat values obtained for from the study demonstrated acceptable precision with RSDr values of 1.03 to 6.68% and HorRat values determined to be between 0.23 and 1.52 for ethanol determination within kefir samples. Similarly, acceptable values of RSDr ranging from 1.45 to 3.39% and HorRat ranging from 0.25 to 0.49 were observed with methanol\n\nOutput: information retrieval system; user query: \"how to clean a coffee maker\"; most relevant web page: https://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+clean+a+coffee+maker\ninformation retrieval system; user query: \"best laptop under 5000\"; most relevant web page: https://www.amazon.in/s?k=laptops&ref=nb_sb_noss_2\ninformation retrieval system; user query: \"top-rated smartphones\"; most relevant web page: https://www.androidauthority.com/top-rated-smartphones-791185/\ninformation retrieval system; user query: \"best gaming laptops",

Ethanol, a byproduct of the fermentation process, can be produced as a result, but usually at low levels.
