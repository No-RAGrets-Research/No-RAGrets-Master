Previous works have shown that regardless of the bioreactor design or operation mode, MeOH concentration reaches a threshold after a few hours, but there are no investigations into the reasons behind this phenomenon. The present work entails monitoring both MeOH and formate concentrations during CH4 hydroxylation, where neither a gaseous substrate nor nutrient shortage was evidenced. Under the assayed reaction conditions, bacterial stress was shown to occur, but methanol was not responsible for this. Formate addition was necessary to start MeOH production. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses with 13 C-formate proved that the formate was instrumental in regenerating NADH; formate was exhausted during the reaction, but increased quantities of formate were unable to prevent MeOH production stop.

This latter molecule has garnered growing interest as MeOH can be used as a precursor for plastic and fuel production. Since methanol is liquid at room temperature, it is safer and more convenient to store and transport than pressured gas. Industrial processes that convert CH4 to MeOH currently involve natural gas steam reforming followed by Fisher -Tropsch synthesis on the generated syngas. Several conversion processes exist, but these generally require pressures of around 30 bar and temperatures up to 1,000 ° C (Aasberg-Petersen et al., 2011; Soussan et al., 2016; Lee, 2019), which make them energy intensive. Moreover, these methods only allow partial selectivity and result in signi /uniFB01 cant CO2 emissions (Soussan et al., 2016; Bjorck et al., 2018).

Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b is a model mesophilic non-pathogenic strain that grows at around 30 ° C under atmospheric pressure, whose hydroxylating abilities are well-known (Whittenbury et al., 1970). Methanotrophic central carbon metabolism utilizes CH4 as the sole energy and carbon source, where CH4 is fully oxidized to CO2 through sequential enzymatic oxidations. As shown in Figure 1, the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO) is responsible for CH4 uptake and oxidation into MeOH as per Equation 1: Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) then oxidizes MeOH into formaldehyde, which is later converted into formate by formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FADH).

M. trichosporium OB3b synthesizes two MMO forms, namely soluble MMO (sMMO) and particulate MMO (pMMO), depending on the Cu 2+ concentration (Sirajuddin and Rosenzweig, 2015). Both enzymes catalyze the same oxidation reaction, but pMMO is reported to have greater af /uniFB01 nity toward CH4 (Sirajuddin and Rosenzweig, 2015; Bjorck et al., 2018). pMMO is not stable outside the cell membrane, which explains why whole-cell bacteria are still preferred over the isolated enzyme to catalyze CH4 oxidation into MeOH (Sirajuddin and Rosenzweig, 2015; Soussan et al., 2016). MeOH production has been shown to be exogenous, i.e. , MeOH is accumulated in the external medium (Pen et al., 2014).

Previous studies have evidenced the synergistic effects of NaCl and EDTA (Pen et al., 2014) in ensuring ef /uniFB01 cient MeOH production. As depicted in Figure 1, MDH inhibition interrupts the successive oxidations of MeOH, thus causing collateral damage to the downstream FDH enzyme. This deprives FDH of its substrate, stopping both formate oxidation and NAD + reduction. The addition of sodium formate (NaCOOH) as an external electron donor is therefore necessary to ensure NADH regeneration by FDH, as expressed by Equation 2. Formate also plays a key role in the metabolism of M. trichosporium OB3b (Figure 1); for example, it enters the FIGURE 1 General metabolic pathway for CH4 assimilation in methanotrophic bacteria.

Increasing the initial formate concentration may also be a possible method of preventing formate exhaustion. The MeOH and formate kinetics are displayed in Figure 7B. In all cases, the pH followed identical evolutions (increasing from 7.00 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.80 ± 0.03 at t = 48 h), and the dry biomass concentration remained quasi-constant (data not shown).

As observed previously, a quasi-plateau of the MeOH concentration around 300 mg/L was attained at 20 h, concomitant with formate exhaustion (Figure 7B). Lowering the initial formate concentration resulted in decreased MeOH production.

There were no observed limitations from gaseous substrates or nutrients during the reactions. The results of 13 C-NMR analyses showed that MeOH was produced only by direct CH4 oxidation without formate reduction. In the conditions tested in this work, MeOH was not cytotoxic to the bacteria, whereas the reaction conditions generally appeared to be stressful. Formate was mainly used as an electron donor for NADH regeneration. However, the mass balance calculations highlighted that only half of the NADH produced was devoted to MeOH production. Increasing the formate concentration did not improve MeOH production, hinting that there was metabolic regulation.
