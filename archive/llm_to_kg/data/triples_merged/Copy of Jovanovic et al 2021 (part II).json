I, II) of a complex flow system (Abadie et al., 2012; Gupta et al., 2010; Kruetzer, 2003; Svetlov and Abiev, 2016). Segmented flow, schematically shown in Fig. A1, is often encountered in microscale-based devices. The gas phase in the two-phase flow between parallel plates (Figs. 1 and A1) is most often observed as long ' pancake ' type bubbles. Experimental pieces of evidence of this type of segmented flow in the BLP bioreactor with immobilized methanotrophs are researched and documented in Jovanovic et al. (2018) and Oregon State University (2013). Under these commonly encountered microfluidic conditions, one can suitably simplify the transport of substrate (O2) as presented in the main body of the text. It appears that the microscalebased design of bioreactors with immobilized microbial species (in films, beads, etc.) radically benefits transport intensification in the segmented flow dispositions similar to the one illustrated in Fig. A1.\n\nOutput: [('Navier-Stokes', 'equation', 'Eqs.
