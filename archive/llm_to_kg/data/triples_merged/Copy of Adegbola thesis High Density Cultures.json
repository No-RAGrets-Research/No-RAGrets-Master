SMMO  has gained a great deal of attention in the bioremediation and chemical industries because of its  low  substrate  specificity  and  its  ability  to  oxidize  chlorinated  hydrocarbons.  Much literature exists on cultivating this organism on methane, however no one has achieved dry  cell  weight  densities  exceeding  18  g/L.

This study investigated the growth of M. trichosporium on the water soluble carbon source, methanol while retaining sMMO activity. Methanol was found to completely inhibit growth at 40 g/L. For online methanol measurements  during  fed-batch  cultivation,  an in  situ probe  was  constructed  from autoclavable materials and equipped with a Figaro TGS822 vapor sensor. The probe was designed  to  prevent  the  sensor  coming  in  contact  with  water  aerosols  which  affect  its performance.  The  probe  was  an  essential  component  of  a  feedback  methanol  control system.  The  cumulative  CO2  production  (CCP)  strategy  was  used  to  feed  methanol  in fed-batch experiments.

A  major  problem  encountered  in  high  cell  density cultivation of this organism, is the solubility of methane in liquid medium. At high cell 2 densities,  the  availability  of  the  carbon  source  is  primarily  limited  by  mass  transfer  of gaseous methane to the aqueous phase. A potential solution to this problem is the use of a water  soluble  carbon  source.  Methanol  although  it  inhibits  growth  above  certain concentrations, is a good alternative due to its infinite solubility in water, and low cost. In addition, methanol is less flammable than methane and thus has less of a hazard for large scale use.

A  step  change  in  liquid  methanol concentration from 1 to 2 g/L resulted in similar sensor response times (approximately 12 min)  at  each  flow  rate  (Figure  3-2).  There  was  negligible  effect  of  the  corresponding residence times at the different flow rates because the actual residence time in the probe was quite low in comparison to the overall response time. At a flow rate of 19 ml/min it takes approximately 0.5 seconds to transport methanol from the membrane chamber to the  sensor  (calculated  based  on  the  probe  length  of  1.5  ft  and  PTFE  tube  diameter  of 1/4') and 0.15 seconds at a flow rate of 60 mL/min. This indicates that the limiting factor is mass transfer across the silicone membrane. In Figures 3-2 and 3-3, it can be observed that sensitivity of the sensor output had decreased with increasing air flow rate.  A flow rate of 19 mL/min was fixed for subsequent studies. 23 flow rates, is shown. 1.3 1.6\n\nOutput: sentences = [\n    ('A step change in liquid methanol concentration', 'resulted in', 'similar sensor response times'),\n    ('At a flow rate of 19 mL/min', 'it takes', 'approximately 0.5 seconds to transport methanol from the membrane chamber to the sensor'),\n    ('At a flow rate of 60 mL/min', 'it takes', '0.15 seconds to transport methanol from the membrane chamber to the sensor'),\n    ('The limiting factor is mass transfer across the silicone membrane', 'is', 'the actual residence time in the probe'),\n    ('Flow rate of 1",

The first is a result of the  electronic  measuring  circuit  (Appendix  A)  that  makes  use  of  a  voltage  divider configuration to quantify changes in conductance of the detecting element (SnO2) which yields  a  parabolic  relationship  between  output  voltage  and  conductance.
