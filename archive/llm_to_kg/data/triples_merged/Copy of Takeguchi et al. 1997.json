When methane  is oxidized, the  product is  subsequently oxidized  by methanol  dehydrogenase contained in  the  same bacterium. To prevent further oxidation of  methanol, the  cell suspension was treated by cyclopropanol, an irreversible inhibitor for  methanol  dehydrogenase, leading to  extracellular methanol  accumulation. However,  the  reaction\n\nOutput: [('Copyright GLYPH<14>9 1997', 'by', 'Humana Press Inc.'), ('All rights of any nature whatsoever eserved.', 'reserved.', None)]",

Methane  mono-oxygenase  (MMO)  catalyzes the  single-step oxidation of  methane  to  methanol  according to  the  following equation: Purified MMO is not  suitable in  methanol  synthesis reaction, because of  the  instability. Thus,  the  production of  methanol  from methane with methanotroph  was tried. When  the  cell suspension was treated by cyclopropanol, which  was an  irreversible inhibitor for  MDH,  it led  to  extracellular methanol  accumulation, as  shown in  Scheme 1 (1). In  this paper, we hope to  describe the  improvement  of  methanol  yield by selecting culture and  reaction conditions.

The  propene  epoxidation by the  cells that were not  treated with  cyclopropanol was measured in  the presence  of  methanol  instead of  sodium formate. The rate  of  propene oxide  formation was 116 ~tmol/min/g of  dry  cell, similar to  the  rate of methanol  consumption  (117  ~tmol/min/g of  dry  cell). This  result suggests that in  this system  the  rate of  methane  hydroxylation (the pMMO activity) is  limited by the  rate of  methanol  consumption  (the MDH activity), and Applied  Biochemistry and Biotechnology Vol. 68, 1997 Methanol  Biosynthesis by M. trichosporium OB3b\n\nOutput:  [('Tonge and coworkers', 'propose', 'that the physiological electron donor for pMMO in M. trichosporium OB3b was not NADH'), ('Andrew and coworkers', 'report', 'that quinols are capable of directly reducing detergentsolubilized pMMO from M. capsulatus (Bath)'), ('cells that were not treated with cyclopropanol', 'measured', 'propene epoxidation by the cells')), ('methanol consumption', 'limited', 'by the rate of methanol consumption')] Here's how I arrived at each",
