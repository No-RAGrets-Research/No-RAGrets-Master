Methanotrophic strains were grouped in different categories (Fig. 1) and assessed for their ability to produce methanol based on industrially relevant characteristics. Methanotrophs were segregated into major groups as gamma-proteobacteria (group A, 45 strains) and alphaproteobacteria (group B, 15 strains). Mesophilic strains from each group were further selected to design fermentation process under ambient conditions for industrial product like methanol. Selection of mesophilic methanotrophs resulted in reduction of relevant strains to 33 and 13 from group A and B, respectively (Fig. 1).

Important factors like selection of methanotrophic strain,\nfrom a wide diversity of methanotroph and characteristics like\nmethanol tolerance have not been systematically investigated so\nfar. Methanol being a bulk chemical and its production process\nmust be designed to incur the lowest possible cost. Selection of\nsuitable methanotrophic platform can play a key critical role in\nminimizing process requirements and operational costs. Key char-\nacteristics of methanotroph like optimum temperature for growth,\nmethanol tolerance, methane conversion rate, titer, yield and pro-\nductivity can have an impact on the overall cost of the bioprocess.\nIn the present study, an industrially suitable organism was\nsystematically selected from wide diversity of genus and species of\nmethanotrophs.
