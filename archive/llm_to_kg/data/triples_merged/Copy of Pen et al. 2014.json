Introduction Methane constitutes a large carbon feedstock that can potentially be used for the production of valuable oxygenated liquid products such as methanol or formic acid (Caballero and Perez, 2013). Developing processes that allow the selective hydroxylation of methane, i.e., its conversion into methanol, is thus of great interest. The high stability of its C-H bonds makes methane remarkably inert, however, and despite recent progress, its chemical activation remains unselective and highly energy consuming (Alvarez-Galvan ⇑ Corresponding author.\n\nOutput: facts = [\n    ('batch reactor', 'type', 'Membrane bioreactor'),\n    ('batch reactor', 'avoidance', 'gas bubbles'),\n    ('batch reactor', 'avoidance', 'dangerous gas mixtures'),\n    ('obtained productivity', 'higher than', 'only other MBR reported'),\n    ('methane', 'carbon feedstock', 'valuable oxygenated liquid products'),\n    ('methane', 'conversion', 'methanol'),\n    ('methane', 'chemical activation', 'unselective and highly energy consuming'),\n    ('methane', 'C-H bonds', 'remarkably inert')",

Regarding the mass transfer between the gas phases and the liquid containing the bacteria, it should be enhanced to avoid any substrate limitation. From the safety viewpoint, the risk lies in the fact that the mixture of the two gaseous substrates could be explosive: methane in air is indeed explosive between 5% v/v (LEL: Lower Explosive Limit) and 15% v/v (UEL: Upper Explosive Limit).

In the case of batch reactors (Duan et al., 2011; Kim et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2004), the headspace is commonly filled with a substrate mixture containing a large methane excess to avoid explosion. In such reactors, the effective mass transfer area, which corresponds to the physical contact surface between gas and liquid, is relatively small and may limit the transfer. This notably explains why continuously sparging the gaseous substrates directly into the bacterial suspension constitutes a usual way of feeding to prevent any substrate depletion (Kim et al., 2010; Lee et al., 2004; Markowska and Michalkiewicz, 2009).

In particular, a modification of the NMS medium by an enrichment in iron(II) and copper(II) favors MMO production (Fox et al., 1990).

Nevertheless, total methanol quantities recovered in the condensate volumes ranged from 0.5 to 1.6 ± 0.1 mM and the average methanol quantity accumulated inside the bioreactor over 24 h was 571 ± 28 mM.

The MBR differs from the batch reactor by its regular substrate feed. Its better performance could be due to a substrate limitation in the batch reactor or to enhanced mass transfer in the MBR.

Moreover, with a lower biocatalyst concentration (11 u ml /C0 1 ), the dissolved oxygen concentration was equal to the saturation value even though a similar adsorption was observed (35 ± 4% of the bacteria were adsorbed after 22 h). The fact that the catalytic concentration was 6.4-fold higher at 70 u m /C0 1 than at 11 u ml /C0 1 induced a 9-fold higher mass concentration in this case, which could explain why adsorption had an effect on the mass transfer at 70 u ml /C0 1 and not at 11 u ml /C0 1 .
