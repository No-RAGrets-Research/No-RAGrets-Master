Methane is the primary component  in  natural  and  shale  gas  up  to  95%.  Thus, methane  has  attracted  much  attention  as  the  alternative chemical feedstock on the positive aspect, but in addition to  being  a  greenhouse  gas  25-times  more  harmful  than carbon  dioxide  [12].  Methane  is  the  resource  of  power stations at present and can be used as a basic raw material [19].  However,  methane  is  difficult  to  transport  from production sites in remote locations to the place where it is to be consumed,  since methane  is  a gas  at  ambient temperatures (boiling point: -164 o C) [20]. Conversion of methane to methanol has attracted enormous interest  because  methanol  is  easy  to  handle  and  has  a higher\n\nOutput:satisfaction with their work.

In this work, we produced methanol from  methane  using  whole  cells  of Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  as  the  biocatalyst. M. trichosporium OB3b was cultured on NMS medium with a supply of 7:3 air/methane ratio at  30 o C.  The  optimal  concentrations  of  various  methanol  dehydrogenase  inhibitors  such  as potassium phosphate and EDTA were determined to be 100 and 0.5 mM, respectively, for an efficient production of methanol. Sodium formate (40 mM) as a reducing power source was added  to  enhance  the  conversion  efficiency.  A  productivity  of  49.0  mg/l·h,  titer  of  0.393 g methanol/l, and conversion of 73.8% (mol methanol/mol methane) were obtained under the optimized batch condition.

Thus, there are economic and  technological  demands  for  the  development  of  an efficient  conversion  technology  of  methane  to  methanol. However, the direct conversion of methane to methanol is a technological challenge owing to the strong C-H bonds in methane [11].

As an alternative, direct biological methods can be employed to convert methane to methanol. Biological  conversion  is  more  selective  and  requires  less energy since bioconversion is conducted at ambient temperatures  [6].  Methane-to-methanol  conversion  using methanotrophic cells as the biocatalysts has been conducted to replace the chemical process [5, 13]. In metabolic assimilation of methane in methanotrophs, methane is converted to methanol by methane monooxygenase (MMO). Methanol is converted to formaldehyde by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), which is then oxidized to formate and finally to carbon dioxide [15]. Thus, methanol is not a final  product  and  is  readily  converted  to  formaldehyde, which  is used  to synthesize cell  biomass via ribulose monophosphate  (RuMP)  or  the  serine  pathway  [10].
