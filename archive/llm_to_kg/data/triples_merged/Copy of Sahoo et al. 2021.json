Biotransformation of C1 Compounds Using Methanotrophs can be exploited to produce methanol using methanotrophs. The limitations associated with biological production of methanol from methane can be overcome by utilizing CO2 as the substrate for some methanotrophic species (Xin et al., 2007; Patel et al., 2016a). This is done in a two-stage process, where methane is utilized as carbon substrate during the first-stage to produce biomass, and CO2 is reduced by the generated biomass in the second-stage to produce methanol (Xin et al., 2007). CO2, an end-product of general methanotrophic metabolism (first-stage), tends to shift the reaction equilibrium in the backward direction if fed in excess to the cells (second-stage).
