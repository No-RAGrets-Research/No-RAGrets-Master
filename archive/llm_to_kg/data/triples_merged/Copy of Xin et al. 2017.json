Direct oxidation of ethylene to epoxyethane with molecular oxygen is a significant synthetic method for both industry and academia. During the last decades, many research works have been focused on epoxidation reactions of ethylene by supported catalysts such as transition metal complexes and metal nanoparticles [3-6]. In contrast with chemical synthetic methods, the biocatalytic reaction appears to be a mild and simple method [7]. One biocatalytic method for producing epoxyethane is using enzymes to insert oxygen across the carbon double bonds of ethylene. Methane monooxygenase (MMO) is such a fascinating enzyme that can efficiently catalyze ethylene to ethylene epoxide with high region specificity and stereoselectivity [8, 9]. Epoxyethane synthesis by MMO catalysis has significant application potential as it is performed at normal temperature and pressure and causes no pollution.

In the past few years, many studies have been focused on MMO catalyzed epoxidation of propene, but with little attention to ethylene.

Hou performed a gas-solid bioreactor to ensure continuous production and removal of product 2 Journal of Chemistry epoxide from the microenvironment of the biocatalyst [11]. Xin et al. chose methane as the electron-donating cosubstrate for propene epoxidation and maximum production of epoxypropane occurred in an atmosphere of 30% methane [12].

However, the initial MMO activity is only partly resumed (45%, 55%) with formaldehyde (5 mmol/L) and formate (10 mmol/L) as the regeneration substrates of nonviable cells. Formaldehyde and formate completely inactivate cells in the second regeneration cycle. The results suggest that formaldehyde and formate are toxic to the Methylosinus trichosporium IMV3011 cells. In this work, formaldehyde and formate produce a positive effect under the best amendment condition (5 mmol/L formaldehyde, 10 mmol/L formate).

In other words, after the initial oxidation step, methane may be further degraded to regenerate reducing NADH, which can promote further ethylene epoxidation.

MMO plays a critical role in ethylene epoxidation, which has been found in methanotrophic bacteria. MMO requires a cosubstrate, NADH, for continuous catalysis of the epoxidation of ethylene. In whole cell suspension, when the cosubstrate is depleted, the epoxyethane production stops. Hence, stimulation of epoxidation by methane and its metabolites was investigated in this study. The main reason for the stimulation may be the provision of additional reducing power, or the reduced form of NAD + , for the MMO. Methane and methanol were postulated to be electrondonating cosubstrates since they do not result in toxicity and provide an abundant reductant for ethylene epoxidation. Batch experiment data shows that addition of 10% methane or 3 mmol/L methanol improves production of epoxyethane. A major challenge in the biosynthesis process for the production of epoxyethane is inhibition of production. Results presented here reveal that Methylosinus trichosporium IMV\n\nOutput: three facts:\n\n- \"methane\" has the property \"electrondonating\"\n- \"methanol\" has the property \"electrondonating\"\n- \"Methylosinus trichosporium IMV\" has the property \"inhibits production\"\n\nThe provided text contains no explicit statements about any subject, relation, or object within the context of logical reasoning involving factual triples.

Based on the present results, it is concluded that a whole cell suspension of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 represents an efficient biocatalyst for the biosynthesis of epoxyethane. To make the application of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 on epoxyethane biosynthesis more feasible, uninterrupted reductant for ethylene epoxidation and continuous removal of toxic product are required.
