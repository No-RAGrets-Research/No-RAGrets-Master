The elevation in temperature primarily stems from the escalation in the concentration of greenhouse gases (GHG) such as   CO 2 ,   CH4, and   N 2 O within the atmosphere. Among these gases, methane   (CH 4 ) is particularly significant in driving alterations to the worldwide climate.

Methane oxidation The initial step in the oxidation of methane by aerobic methanotrophs is catalyzed by MMOs.

This utilization has been recently explored and reviewed in publications such as Tentori et al. (2022) and Tyne et al. (2023). Research needs and future direction Currently, no bacterial strain has demonstrated efficient methane assimilation for both cell growth and chemical production. The challenge lies in achieving stable folding of MMO, with the primary obstacle being the control of DNA-protein crosslinking by formaldehyde during methanol oxidation (Cheng et al. 2022). The development of robust synthetic methanotrophs for targeted product production demands significant efforts in engineering techniques and the study of evolutionary mechanisms, as emphasized by Whiddon et al.\n\nOutput: [('pMMO', 'presumed transmembrane region', None), ('extensive dataset', 'pmo', 'functional gene probe'), ('Tentori et al.', 'publication', '2022'), ('Tyne et al.', 'publication', '2023'), ('no bacterial strain', 'efficient methane assimilation', 'cell growth and chemical production'), ('DNA-protein crosslinking', 'formaldehyde', 'methanol oxidation'), ('Whiddon et al.', 'publication', '2022')] Here is the extracted list of factual triples:\n\n1.

To enhance the efficiency of pMMO in different organisms for methane incorporation, it is crucial to understand its native environment and the specific sites where methane binds. These insights would bridge a substantial knowledge gap for researchers. Despite recent advancements in methanogenesis and methanotrophy research, particularly the importance of soils like paddy soils in the methane cycle, further exploration is essential to deepen our understanding of these mechanisms and develop innovative eco-friendly methods. Additionally, a more comprehensive grasp of the contributions of various ecosystems to the global methane balance is needed. Several research areas warrant further investigation, including extensive field studies in rice paddies, exploration of novel methane production processes in aerobic conditions (such as non-microbial methanogenic chemical processes and methane production by terrestrial plants), utilization of advanced molecular biology techniques to\n\nOutput: verbs = ['enhance', 'understand', 'bridge', 'explore', 'deepen', 'develop', 'investigate', 'study', 'research', 'contribute'] nouns = ['pMMO', 'native environment', 'specific sites', 'mechanisms', 'global methane balance', 'methane cycle', 'rice paddies', 'novel methane production processes', 'advanced molecular biology techniques'] entities = ['To', '(2019)', 'For', 'the', 'invention', 'of', 'the', 'development', 'of', 'the', 'application', 'of',",
