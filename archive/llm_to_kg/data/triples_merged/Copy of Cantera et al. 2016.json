Therefore, a more ef /uniFB01 cient transfer of CH4 favored the presence of dominant methanotrophs, while a lower CH4 effective supply rate promoted the occurrence of non-specialized organisms. 4.2.

However, other studies assessing the in /uniFB02 uence of copper on MB structure and MMO expression in natural ecosystems did not observe sMMO or type II MB at concentrations as low as 0.1 m M(Chen et al., 2007; Ho et al., 2013; Semrau et al., 2010). Thus, the mechanisms governing both the environmental distribution of both enzymes and the cross-effect of multiple parameters on the type of methanotrophs enriched or the enzyme expression are still unclear.
