Methanol is used as a solvent component of some antifreeze solutions, paints, gasoline additives and ethanol denaturants. However, most massive methanol poisonings (Argentina 1993, Norway 2002, Czech Republic 2012 and Libya 2013) were caused by the ingestion of adulterated alcoholic beverages (1-3). Methanol is a toxic substance and is metabolized to formaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and is then converted to formic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase in the liver. Formic acid is the principle toxic metabolite that can cause severe problems at high concentrations ( . 200 mg / L) and warrants hemodialysis treatment (4). Therefore, the initial stage of methanol intoxication is typically asymptomatic. During the later stage (6-12 h after ingestion), serious symptoms caused by methanol and formic acid can occur.

Without medical intervention, the high serum concentrations of formic acid can cause respiratory and renal failure, coma and eventually death. In the late phase, the diagnostic hallmark of methanol poisoning is the presence of a high anion gap, osmolal gap and metabolic acidosis. These indicators are unfortunately not specific and can be caused by other conditions, for instance diabetic ketoacidosis or multiple organ failure (5). Thus, measurement of serum methanol, and ideally formic acid, its major toxic metabolite in serum, is required to differentiate the cause of the patient's condition. Despite the toxicity at elevated serum concentrations of formic acid, it is normally present in mammals due to the degradation of amino acids and external sources like the diet, alcoholic beverages or inhalation of methanol vapors. In previous studies, the serum formic acid concentration in living subjects has ranged up to 44 mg / L (6, 7).\n\nOutput: instances of optical nerve, abdominal discomfort, nausea and headache; symptoms of respiratory and renal failure, coma and eventual death; causes of methanol poisoning; diagnostic hallmark of methanol poisoning; indicators of methanol poisoning; non-specificity of indicators; measurement of serum methanol and formic acid; normal presence of formic acid in mammals; sources of formic acid in mammals; range of serum formic acid concentration in living subjects.

Previously published methods employed different sample preparation techniques, including direct injection, static and dynamic headspace or headspace injection using solid-phase microextraction (HS-SPME) (8, 9). Headspace GC (HS-GC) is now the most widely used technique for the detection of volatile organic compounds in biological fluids, mainly for its ability to detect trace levels of volatiles without the need for complex sample preparation. Formic acid is commonly analyzed after derivatization with methanol to methyl formate or with ethanol to ethyl formate under acidic conditions (6, 8, 10).

Formate determination by capillary electrophoresis has been reported, but despite excellent separation efficiency and short separation times, this method is limited to the analysis of small ions only and is rarely used in clinical laboratory practice worldwide (12). Unfortunately, there is a lack of appropriate methods for simultaneous determination of methanol and formic acid. The simultaneous measurement of toxic formic acid along with parent methanol is clearly desirable for both enhanced clinical service and the correct diagnosis.
