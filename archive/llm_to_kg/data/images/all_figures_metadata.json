Different process designs like batch\nmode fermentation, membrane reactor, use of co-culture and\nvarious immobilization strategies have also been investigated\npreviously\nfor\nmethanol\nproduction\n(18e21).\nTable\n1\n(12,15,16,18,22e25) shows recent literature summary of yield,\ntiter and speciﬁc productivity of methanol production by different\nmethanotrophs. Studies on inhibition of methanol dehydrogenase\n(MDH), co-culture biotransformation, use of methane vector and\nregeneration of co-factor from formate have been reported to\nimprove\nmethanol\nproduction\n(1,16,20,26).\nAlthough\nseveral\nstudies have been explored towards production of bio-methanol,\nthe comparison of methanol production between different strains\nis difﬁcult due to variation in culturing protocols, varying cell\nconcentration in biotransformation reaction and supply of reducing\nagent. Important factors like selection of methanotrophic strain,\nfrom a wide diversity of methanotroph and characteristics like\nmethanol tolerance have not been systematically investigated so\nfar. Methanol being a bulk chemical and its production process\nmust be designed to incur the lowest possible cost. Selection of\nsuitable methanotrophic platform can play a key critical role in\nminimizing process requirements and operational costs. Key char-\nacteristics of methanotroph like optimum temperature for growth,\nmethanol tolerance, methane conversion rate, titer, yield and pro-\nductivity can have an impact on the overall cost of the bioprocess.\nIn the present study, an industrially suitable organism was\nsystematically selected from wide diversity of genus and species of\nmethanotrophs. Selected strains were investigated for methanol\ntolerance, requirements of reducing energy and optimization of\nMDH inhibitors. Methanol production using biogas generated on\nsecond generation feedstock was also evaluated.",

In an effort to identify one such lim- \niting component, the effect of the culture medium Fe \nlevel was investigated (Table IV). When about half of \nthe usual Higgins medium Fe level (18 pmol/L) was \nemployed, whole-cell propene oxidative sMMO activity \ndecreased sharply from 105 nmol propene oxide \nformed/mg dry cell wt min to 47 nmol/mg dry cell wt \nmin at around 70 h. The cell density at that time was \n1.5 g dry wt/L, which was also about one-half of the \nfinal cell density achievable with the standard medium \nFe level of 40 pmol/L (Table I). When an additional \n50 pmol/L of Fe was supplemented at 90 h (total \n68 pmol/L), a normal high level of the sMMO activity \nwas restored within 24 h. Furthermore, cell growth \n( p  = 0.009 h-') continued up to 5.4 g dry cell wt/L \nwithout any appreciable decline in the whole cell enzy- \nmatic activity.

This is about five times lower than the \nvalue reported for Klebsiella aerogenes,** and it may be \nattributable to high Fe requirement for sMMO produc- \ntion by some methanotrophic bacteria.

The \nepoxidation of propylene by this soluble methane \nmonooxygenase system using NADH 2 which was \nregenerated/generated by dehydrogenases and their \nsubstrates was also demonstrated (Hou et al. 1982c). \nFigure 1 shows the cofactor regeneration scheme for \nthe production of propylene oxide.",

In addition, it \nwas found that the methanol accumulation reached a plateau at 48 h, \nwhich could be due to the limited amount of formate in the medium. \nThe effect of phosphate addition, formate addition, and CH4/air ratio \non CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency is further presented in Fig. 3. \nSimilar to the results in Fig. 2, the highest CH4 to methanol conversion \nefficiency was observed at 50 mmol/L of phosphate addition, 100 \nmmol/L of formate addition, and CH4/air ratio of 1:1 (Fig. 3). Statistical \nanalysis revealed that 50 mmol/L of phosphate addition significantly (p \n< 0.05) increased the CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency (increased \n1.29–13.16-fold) in comparison with other two trials with different \nphosphate addition (Fig. 3b). While 100 mmol/L of formate addition did \nnot show a significant (p > 0.05) increase in CH4 to methanol conversion \nefficiency compared two 150 mmol/L and 200 mmol/L of formate ad­\nditions (Fig. 3d). It was noted that the CH4 to methanol conversion ef­\nficiency with 50 mmol/L of formate addition was 0 since no methanol \nwas accumulated at the termination (Fig. 3d). There were significant \ndifferences in CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency between CH4/air \nratios of 2:1, 1:1 (or 1:2, or 1:4) and 1:6 (p < 0.05), but no significant \ndifference between CH4/air ratios of 1:1, 1:2, and 1:4 (p > 0.05) \n(Fig. 3f). The maximum CH4 to methanol conversion efficiency of 0.22 \nmol/mol is comparable to that obtained by Methylosinus trichosporium at \nthe same CH4/air ratio [6,41].",

Linearity was analyzed from the\nregression of the calibration curves acquired from the ratio\nbetween the peak area and the concentration of the analyte.\nThe criteria for acceptance of linearity are marked for a\ncoefficient of determination (R2) of at least 0.99. In the\nconcentration range that was studied, which ranged from 0.049\nto 100 g/L, the analytical response was linear with an R2 value\nof 0.994 for methanol and 0.928 for ethanol, indicating a\nproportional increase of peak area to the analyte concentration.\nThe discrepancies noted from the EE calculation of methanol\nand ethanol specifically for extremely low concentrations\nindicate the need for its elimination from the calibration curve.\nThe linearity curve resulting from the elimination of these\nvalues (0.049 and 0.098 g/L) gives an R2 value of 1.000 for\nmethanol and 0.997 for ethanol samples. However, it should be\nconsidered that the linear parameters from the ethanol\ncalibration curve are estimated without considering the ethanol\npresent in ethyl acetate. Figure 4a,b shows the linearity\nachieved for methanol and ethanol in the concentration range\n0.195−100 g/L. Table 5 shows the parameters obtained for the\ncalibration curves of the two analytes extracted using K2CO3\nand ethyl acetate.\nThe constant EE attained for methanol extraction supports\nthe linearity of the calibration curve attained for this method.\nFurthermore, it is worthy to know the influence of CEtAc on the\ncalibration curve of ethanol. A linear correlation can be made\nbetween the concentration of ethanol in the extract estimated\npreviously (Cextract) and peak area. As can be seen in Figure 5,\nthe response is linear with an R2 value of 0.998, indicating a\ngood correlation. Table 5 shows the data indicating the\nlinearity parameters attained for methanol and ethanol\nconcentration studied.\nLimit of Quantification and Limit of Detection.\nAccording to the International Council for Harmonisation of\nTechnical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use\n(ICH) guidelines,37 the LOQ is defined as the lowest\nconcentration of the analyte present in the sample that can\nbe detected and measured with an acceptable level of precision\nand accuracy. Therefore, the LOQ value is taken as the lowest\nvalue on the linearity curve that gives an R2 value higher than\n0.99. As a result, the LOQ estimated from the calibration curve\nis 0.195 g/L for both methanol and ethanol. To confirm the\nreproducibility and accuracy of the measurement, the selected\nconcentration (0.195 g/L) of methanol and ethanol was\nextracted 10 times, and each processed sample was injected\nthree times using the selected GC−FID method.

The cell density was adjusted to 0.6 mg dry\ncells/mL. The sample solution (100 mL), treated with 100\nmM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 mM sodium formate, was\nintroduced into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask with a screw\ncap. After the flask was incubated for 5 min at 25°C, the\nreaction was initiated by replacing 200 mL of air in the\nhead-space of the flask with the same volume of methane/\nair mixture (1:1, v/v). \nMethanol was also produced in a repeated batch mode in\na 500 mL flask. In this process methanol was removed\nperiodically to prevent the accumulation of high concent-\nrations, which can retard further methanol biosynthesis.\nAfter an 8 h reaction, 100 mL of the reaction mixture was\ncentrifuged with sterilized tubes at 15,000 × g, to separate\nthe newly produced methanol from the reaction suspen-\nsion. In the following reaction, the harvested cells were\nresuspended in the 12.9 mM phosphate buffer and intro-\nduced into the 500 mL flask.

Under\nthese conditions, M. trichosporium OB3b accumulated a\nmaximum concentration of 7.7 mM methanol after a 36 h\nreaction. To observe the effect of NaCl on cell morphology,\nthe ultra-structural features of M. trichosporium OB3b\nwere observed by TEM. At a concentration of 100 mM,\nNaCl did not affect the normal cell morphology. Higher\nconcentrations, however, caused the slime layer to dis-\nappear and disrupted the intracytoplasmic membrane struc-\nture (Fig. 2). We found that MDH and pMMO activities\nwere reduced by 55 and 30%, respectively, in the presence\nof 200 mM NaCl, but were reduced by only 25 and 20%,\nrespectively, at 100 mM NaCl. To preserve the activity of\npMMO, which is very unstable under aerobic conditions,\nthe purification procedure should be done under anoxic\nconditions. The reduction in pMMO activity seen with\nhigh NaCl concentrations might be as a result of di-\nsruptions in the slime layer that allow direct contact of\npMMO with oxygen. At the same time, NaCl inhibits the\ntransfer of electrons from MDH to cytochrome cL in the\nprocess of methanol oxidation. These results indicate that\nthe optimum NaCl concentration for stable methanol\nproduction should be lower than 200 mM.",
