    "caption": "Recently, we have identified and purified many \ndehydrogenases from methylotrophic microorgan- \nisms: methanol dehydrogenase (Patel et al. 1978), \naldehyde dehydrogenase (Patel et al. 1980a), formal- \ndehyde reductase (Hou et al. 1982a), formate \ndehydrogenase (Hou et al. 1982b), secondary alcohol \ndehydrogenase (Hou et al. 1979b; 1981a), and \npropanediol dehydrogenase (Hou et al. 1983). We \nhave also demonstrated the epoxidation of alkenes by \ncell-free soluble methane monooxygenase from a \nfacultative methylotroph, Methylobacterium sp. (Pa- \ntel et al. 1982), and an obligate methanotroph, \nMethylosinus sp. CRL 31 (Hou et al. 1982c). The \nepoxidation of propylene by this soluble methane \nmonooxygenase system using NADH 2 which was \nregenerated/generated by dehydrogenases and their \nsubstrates was also demonstrated (Hou et al. 1982c). \nFigure 1 shows the cofactor regeneration scheme for \nthe production of propylene oxide.",

    "caption": "Different whole-cell immobilization methods were \nstudied. Covalent binding of the cells to long ligands \nof a macro molecule or polyacrylamide entrapment of \ncells all resulted in loss of propylene epoxidation \nactivity. This is possibly due to the alteration of the \nmembrane structure or the creation of a diffusion \nbarrier for gaseous substrates by polyacrylamide. \nFinally, a simple gas-solid heterogeneous bioreactor \nsystem was successfully demonstrated for the contin- \nuous production of propylene oxide. Cell paste of \nmethane-grown Methylosinus sp. CRL 31 in 0.05 M \npotassium phosphate buffer pH 7.0 was coated on \nporous glass beads (2 mm diameter). Cells (about 20 \nmg cell protein) were physically adhered in a thin \nlayer on these glass beads (about 7 ml) and were \npacked in a glass reactor (15 cm x i cm 0) 1 (Fig. 2). \nThe bioreactor was equipped with a jacket for \ncirculating water to control reaction temperature.",
