The small footprint of mobile flow reactors and the different supply chain logistics in a\nmicroscale manufacturing sequence compared with the large footprint of fixed batch reactors is illustrated for an industrial plant, but this strategic advantage extends far\nbeyond industrial synthesis to various areas of decentralized just-in-time manufacturing.",

    "caption": "reaction conditions and single and multiphase reactions are\npossible with widely applicable, cost- and resource-efﬁcient\nmanufacturing techniques in modular microreactors made\nof suitable materials [46]. Microreactors can be adapted to\nbioprocess needs, as demonstrated with the multi-input\nreactor in the transketolase-catalyzed synthesis of L-ery-\nthrulose [22]. That there are only two patents for micro-\nreactors designed for biocatalytic reactions indicates the\ndevelopment opportunities [47]. Biocatalytic processes in\nmicroﬂuidic systems encompass a broad range of materials\nand systems, ranging from simple capillaries and tubing to\ncustom-made microchannels, monoliths, and microstruc-\ntured reactors with inserted nanomaterial (Table 2).\nEnzymatic microreactors can be classiﬁed with respect to\nshape, materials used, and interface preparation or with\nrespect to ﬂow characteristics. Y-shaped, C-shaped, T-\nshaped, X-shaped, or tapered are the most common micro-\nchannel shapes, made mainly from glass, silicon, ceramic,\nstainless steel, or polymer materials. Immobilized enzyme\nprocessing and interface preparation in microreactors are\nemerging technologies implemented to increase the surface\narea as a major factor in enzymatic microreactors. Struc-\ntures can be etched from, cast into, deposited onto, or grown\ndirectly from microchannel surfaces [46]. Wall-coated sup-\nports and especially nanosprings or other nanostructured\nmaterials are recognized as another efﬁcient method to\nincrease surface area and enzyme loading in microreactors\n[22,23,48]. Some of the most common types of enzymatic\nmicroreactor already demonstrate the speciﬁc features of",
