Plants convert CO2 into different sources, that is, food and energy, to support human society development.\nExcessive human activity releases large amount of CO2 exceeding the CO2 sequestration speed by plants and leads to accumulation of CO2 in\natmosphere causing “greenhouse effect.” (b) C1 sources (i.e., CO2 and methanol) utilization by microorganisms in biorefinery for production of\nchemicals and biofuels, allowing for a sustainable circular carbon economy. One‐carbon feedstock (CO2‐based or methanol‐based) can be used\nby microorganisms in a biorefinery process to replace fuels and chemicals that produced today by petroleum‐refinery process. 1,3BPGA, 1,3\nbisphosphoglycerate; 3PGA, 3‐phosphoglycerate; DHA, dihydroxyacetone;DHAP, dihydroxyacetone phosphate; F6P, fructose 6‐phosphate;\nG3P, glyceraldehyde‐3‐phosphate; H6P, hexose 6‐phosphate; Pyr, pyruvate; Ru1,5BP, ribulose 1,5‐bisphosphate; Ru5P, ribulose‐5‐phosphate;\nXu5P, xylulose‐5‐phosphate",
