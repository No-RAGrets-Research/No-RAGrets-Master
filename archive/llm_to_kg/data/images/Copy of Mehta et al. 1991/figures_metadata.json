The UF cell was filled with \n50 mL of DEAE-cellulose immobilized microbial cell \npreparation suspended in 20 mM phosphate buffer \n(pH 6.4) at a density of 4 mg dry weight carrier/mL \nreactor volume. The top disc was sealed air tight, and \ntwo silicone rubber tubes (1 mm diameter) were in- \nserted from the inlet hole of the UF cell. One of the \nsilicone tubes was extended to the bottom of the cell \nand connected to a sparger made of a hard, plastic tube \n(1 mm diameter) ring with holes along the periphery. \nThe pressure release vent of the UF cell was replaced \nwith a glass capillary connected through a rubber stop- \nper to be used as an outlet for the circulating gaseous",

The temperature data \nwere replotted in the form of an Arrhenius plot to calcu- \nlate activation energy (E,) for free and immobilized \ncells (Fig. 3). The values of E, for free and immobilized \ncells were computed to be 19,537 and 14,800 cal/mol, \nrespectively. The optimum concentration of phosphate \nions required for inhibition of methanol oxidation activ- \nity was 100 mM, slightly higher than that required by \nthe free cells (80 mM).7 Oxygen appeared to be the rate \nlimiting substrate for methanol biosynthesis in immobi- \nlized cell preparations. The replacement of air with \noxygen in batch cultures supported a total methanol ac- \ncumulation rate of 8.92 pmol/h mg cells, representing \nan increase in conversion efficiency over air supplied \ncells from 10% to 27% (Table I). This value is threefold \nhigher than that reported by HOU\" for propylene oxide \nsynthesis using M. trichosporium OB3b. An increase in \noxygen concentration was seen to result in decreased \nmethane uptake rates. It has been reported that under \noxygen excess (methane limiting) conditions, the en- \nzyme MMO in M. capsulatus and M. trichosporium \nOB3b switches from soluble to particulate form63l3 and \nmay exhibit altered reaction specificities toward differ- \nent substrates. This may be responsible for the observed \nphenomenon. \nThe synthesis of methanol by immobilized cells was \nat a constant rate of 8.75 pmol/h mg cells for the first \n2.5 h (Fig. 4), and the rate fell sharply after 6 h. In our \nearlier studies with free cells, the fall in the methanol \naccumulation rate was attributed to depletion of the \nendogenous NADHz pool, and methanol accumulation \nrate was maximally stimulated by supplying 40 mM for- \nmate to the reaction ves~e1.I~ \nWith immobilized cells, \nmaximum stimulation in methanol accumulation rate to \n8.6 ,umol/h mg cells occurred on addition of 40 mM",

This rate of methanol biosynthesis \ncontinued for 11 h after which a fall in the rate was \nobserved.
