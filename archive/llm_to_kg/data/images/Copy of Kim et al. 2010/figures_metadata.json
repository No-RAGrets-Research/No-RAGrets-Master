Cells were\nharvested in the middle stationary phase by centrifugation\nat 15,000 × g for 10 min, washed with 12.9 mM phosphate\nbuffer (pH 7.0, standard buffer), and resuspended in the\nsame buffer. The cell density was adjusted to 0.6 mg dry\ncells/mL. The sample solution (100 mL), treated with 100\nmM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, and 20 mM sodium formate, was\nintroduced into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask with a screw\ncap. After the flask was incubated for 5 min at 25°C, the\nreaction was initiated by replacing 200 mL of air in the\nhead-space of the flask with the same volume of methane/\nair mixture (1:1, v/v). \nMethanol was also produced in a repeated batch mode in\na 500 mL flask. In this process methanol was removed\nperiodically to prevent the accumulation of high concent-\nrations, which can retard further methanol biosynthesis.\nAfter an 8 h reaction, 100 mL of the reaction mixture was\ncentrifuged with sterilized tubes at 15,000 × g, to separate\nthe newly produced methanol from the reaction suspen-\nsion. In the following reaction, the harvested cells were\nresuspended in the 12.9 mM phosphate buffer and intro-\nduced into the 500 mL flask. Thereafter, 20 mM sodium\nformate was included as a reducing agent for pMMO, and\nthe methane mixture was introduced to the flask. The\nabove procedure was repeated several times.\nLab-scale methanol production was designed in a 3 L\nreactor with 1 L working volume. The reaction was carried\nout in a compulsory circulation diffusion system consisting\nof cylindrical reactor (ø 110 × h 400 mm), portable rubber\ngas bag, mixed gas reservoir containing gas bubbler and\nsilica-gel trap (Fig. 1). The 1 L reaction mixture contained\n100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 20 mM sodium formate, and\n0.6 mg dry cells/mL. A limited volume of fresh methane/\nair mixture was introduced continuously from a rubber gas\nbag into the gas reservoir. Thereafter the mixture was\nforced by an air pump through micro pores prepared in the\nbottom of reactor and dispersed evenly in the reaction\nmixture. Part of methane mixture in the reactor was fed\nback into the gas reservoir, mixed with fresh methane and\nre-circulated into the reactor, until fresh methane in the gas\nbag was consumed completely. This system was set up\nwithin an incubator at 25°C. Produced methanol was",

Effect of NaCl on cell morphology and enzyme\nactivity\nOur previous study established the optimal conditions for\nmethanol biosynthesis by M. trichosporium OB3b: 200\nmM NaCl, 20 mM sodium formate, 0.6 mg dry cells/mL,\n12.9 mM phosphate buffer (pH 7.0), at 25°C [4]. Under\nthese conditions, M. trichosporium OB3b accumulated a\nmaximum concentration of 7.7 mM methanol after a 36 h\nreaction. To observe the effect of NaCl on cell morphology,\nthe ultra-structural features of M. trichosporium OB3b\nwere observed by TEM. At a concentration of 100 mM,\nNaCl did not affect the normal cell morphology. Higher\nconcentrations, however, caused the slime layer to dis-\nappear and disrupted the intracytoplasmic membrane struc-\nture (Fig. 2). We found that MDH and pMMO activities\nwere reduced by 55 and 30%, respectively, in the presence\nof 200 mM NaCl, but were reduced by only 25 and 20%,\nrespectively, at 100 mM NaCl. To preserve the activity of\npMMO, which is very unstable under aerobic conditions,\nthe purification procedure should be done under anoxic\nconditions. The reduction in pMMO activity seen with\nhigh NaCl concentrations might be as a result of di-\nsruptions in the slime layer that allow direct contact of\npMMO with oxygen. At the same time, NaCl inhibits the\ntransfer of electrons from MDH to cytochrome cL in the\nprocess of methanol oxidation. These results indicate that\nthe optimum NaCl concentration for stable methanol\nproduction should be lower than 200 mM.",

Effect of accumulated methanol on further meth-\nanol production\nIt has been reported that the presence of a low concent-\nration of methanol improves methane oxidation in meth-\nanotrophic bacteria, whereas a high concentration of pro-\nduct (methanol) competitively inhibits MMO [13]. Fig. 5\nshows the effect of initial methanol concentration on\npMMO activity in M. trichosporium OB3b, in the presence\nof 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA. Increasing the initial\nmethanol concentration from 5 to 20 mM produced concent-\nration-dependent decreases in both the pMMO-catalyzed\nepoxidation of propene and the conversion of methane to\nmethanol, indicating that high concentrations of methanol\nhave an inhibitory effect on pMMO. The results show that\nmethanol synthesis was inhibited by approximately 60% at\nan initial methanol concentration of 20 mM. This result\nindicates that the removal of methanol accumulated in the\nreaction mixture is required in order to increase the overall\nmethanol production.",
