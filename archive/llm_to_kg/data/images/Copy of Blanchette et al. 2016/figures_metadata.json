Membrane-bound\npMMO is mixed with PEGDA 575 and photoinitiator and exposed to ultraviolet light to crosslink the material. (b) The resulting gel, shown in the vial,\nis immersed in buffer containing the reducing agent NADH and is exposed to CH4 and air. The resulting methanol and protein are quantiﬁed to\ndetermine the speciﬁc activity of the material.",

The methanol produced (per mg of\nprotein) by the thin membrane (black squares) was double that\nproduced by the thick membrane (red circles) over the course of\nthe ﬁrst hour, but then declined relative to that of the thick\nmembrane; after 2 h the average total methanol produced by the\nthin membrane was 1.5 times higher than that produced by\nthe thick membrane. The methanol concentrations produced in\nthe ﬂow reactor were on average 12 and 6% of those predicted\nfor thin and thick lattices, respectively, based on analyte ﬂow\nrates and an assumed pMMO activity of 80 nmol MeOH\nmin \u0002 1mg \u0002 1. The low methanol concentration values relative\nto predicted values may be because of lower actual pMMO\nconcentrations in the material than was calculated based on\ndilution from the stock of known concentration. In addition, a\nsmall amount of methanol (20 mM) was detected in the liquid\nthrough which the gas was bubbling, suggesting that a fraction of\nthe methanol generated was lost as vapour to the gas stream and\nnot collected in the liquid fractions. Further reactor development\nis needed to efﬁciently capture both gas and liquid phase\nmethanol.\nA full understanding of the mass transport and reaction\ncharacteristics of this system would require a kinetic model of the\nenzyme, which is not yet available, and a ﬁnite element model of\nthe membrane, which is beyond the scope of this paper.

The thin membrane may be\nreaction-limited only, unless the crosslinking of the PEG\nsigniﬁcantly slows the transport of NADH. In that case the thin\nmembrane may also be NADH-limited, but less so.
