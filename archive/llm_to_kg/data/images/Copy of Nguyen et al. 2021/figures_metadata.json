Among the 4 types of strains of methanotrophic \nbacteria (M. trichosporium OB3b, M. capsulatus HD6T, M. trichosporium \nIMV3011, Methylomonas sp. GYJ3), M. trichosporium OB3b showed the \nhighest propene epoxidation activity (Zhang et al., 2008b). Xin et al. \nsuccessfully synthesized epoxypropane from propene using methanol as \nthe carbon source and an electron-donating substrate for NADH regen­\neration (Xin et al., 2010). In addition, 0.016% methanol was found to \nhave the highest propene epoxidation capacity of M. trichosporium \nIMV3011. Exhaustion of the reductant and the suppression of toxic \nproducts are difficulties associated with producing epoxyethane from \nethylene. The regeneration of NADH was achieved in batch experiments \nof M. trichosporium IMV 3011 using methane and methanol. The pro­\nduction of epoxyethane was enhanced in 10% gas-phase methane using \nmethane as a reductant for epoxidation. In the case of methanol, the",
