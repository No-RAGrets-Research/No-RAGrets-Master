As shown in Fig. 1, the growth rate of M. trichosporium OB3b \nand the maximum cell density decreased with increasing Cu concentration, \nup to 20 ~M. The maximum specific growth rate was 1.59 x 10-3/min, and \nthe maximum cell density was 0.235 mg dry cell/mL at 1.25 ~d of Cu con- \ncentration. M. trichosporium OB3b grew nicely at 1.25 ~,/of Cu concentra- \ntion, and grew slowly at 20 ~M of Cu concentration.",
