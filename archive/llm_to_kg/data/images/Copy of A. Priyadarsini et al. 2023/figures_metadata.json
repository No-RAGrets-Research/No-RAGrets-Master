The \ndesign of the bioreactor and use of methane vector enhanced the volu­\nmetric mass transfer rate of methane resulting in a high methanol titre \n(Sahoo et al., 2023). The highest methanol titre reported so far is 64.6 \nmM that has been achieved by using co-culture of Metholosinus sporium \nand Methylocystis bryophila and a feed gas composition of methane (30 \n%) and hydrogen (5–20 %) that was derived from anaerobic digestion \nand dark fermentation of rice straw (Patel et al., 2023). Table 1 com­\npares our results with previous literature.",
