The calibration curves were prepared\nas shown in Figure 1. These procedures\nresulted in final concentration of 7.5, 15, 30,\n60, 120, and 240 mg/L of methanol, acetone,\nand acetaldehyde, and with 75, 150, 300, 600,\n1200, and 2400 mg/L of ethanol. These cali-\nbration standards, in B and VH, underwent a\n5 times dilution with a solution containing\n1.2% of Triton X-100 and 1.8 g/L of acetonitrile\nin water, to decrease sample viscosity and\ntherefore facilitate volume measurements and\nsample injection, according to the method\ndescribed by Dubowski (27).\nEach tube was vortex-mixed and centrifuged\nat 16,000 g for 5 min at 4°C. A fixed volume of\nsupernatant (0.5 µL) was injected into the\nchromatographic system.",
