    "caption": "In most batch cultures, microorganisms stop growing at \nthe end of cultivation due to either the depletion of es- \nsential nutrients or the accumulation of inhibitory \nmetabolites in the culture medium. Since raising the \nmedium nitrate concentration did not influence the fi- \nnal cell density (Fig. 6) and the metabolites present in \nthe spent bioreactor medium did not inhibit cell growth \n(data not shown), the maximal cell density attainable \nwith the medium in Table I (lacking CuS04) seems to \nbe determined by some component(s) other than the C, \n0, and N sources. In an effort to identify one such lim- \niting component, the effect of the culture medium Fe \nlevel was investigated (Table IV). When about half of \nthe usual Higgins medium Fe level (18 pmol/L) was \nemployed, whole-cell propene oxidative sMMO activity \ndecreased sharply from 105 nmol propene oxide \nformed/mg dry cell wt min to 47 nmol/mg dry cell wt \nmin at around 70 h. The cell density at that time was \n1.5 g dry wt/L, which was also about one-half of the \nfinal cell density achievable with the standard medium \nFe level of 40 pmol/L (Table I). When an additional \n50 pmol/L of Fe was supplemented at 90 h (total \n68 pmol/L), a normal high level of the sMMO activity \nwas restored within 24 h. Furthermore, cell growth \n( p  = 0.009 h-') continued up to 5.4 g dry cell wt/L \nwithout any appreciable decline in the whole cell enzy- \nmatic activity. This rapid and large Fe effect on the \nsMMO activity is not too suprising, considering that Fe \nis an essential cofactor for the sMMO enzyme complex \nwhich can represent more than 10% of the total soluble \nprotein in some methanotr~phs.'~*'~~~~ \nFrom the depen- \ndence of the final cell density on the initial medium Fe \nlevel, i.e., up to 40 pmol/L, it was possible to calculate \nthe cell yield on Fe as approximately 1.3 x lo3 g dry \ncell wt/g Fe. This is about five times lower than the \nvalue reported for Klebsiella aerogenes,** and it may be \nattributable to high Fe requirement for sMMO produc- \ntion by some methanotrophic bacteria. With an initial \nFe level of either 40 or 80 pmol/L, no sudden decreases \nin whole-cell sMMO activity were observed during the \nbioreactor batch cultivations, although the higher Fe",
