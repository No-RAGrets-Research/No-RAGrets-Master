An increase\nin the copper concentration in nutrient medium above\nthe value of 0.6 × 10−6 mol dm−3 caused intensiﬁca-\ntion of biomass growth, as it was conﬁrmed by ele-\nvation of the growth curves on particular days of the\nprocess operation.\nIn the studies presented in Fig. 3, the largest\ngrowth of biomass was observed when the copper\nconcentration in mineral medium was the lowest\n(0.125 × 10−6 mol dm−3).
