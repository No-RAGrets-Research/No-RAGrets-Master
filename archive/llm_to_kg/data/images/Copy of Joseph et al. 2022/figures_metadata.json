    "caption": "Linearity and Range. Linearity was analyzed from the\nregression of the calibration curves acquired from the ratio\nbetween the peak area and the concentration of the analyte.\nThe criteria for acceptance of linearity are marked for a\ncoefficient of determination (R2) of at least 0.99. In the\nconcentration range that was studied, which ranged from 0.049\nto 100 g/L, the analytical response was linear with an R2 value\nof 0.994 for methanol and 0.928 for ethanol, indicating a\nproportional increase of peak area to the analyte concentration.\nThe discrepancies noted from the EE calculation of methanol\nand ethanol specifically for extremely low concentrations\nindicate the need for its elimination from the calibration curve.\nThe linearity curve resulting from the elimination of these\nvalues (0.049 and 0.098 g/L) gives an R2 value of 1.000 for\nmethanol and 0.997 for ethanol samples. However, it should be\nconsidered that the linear parameters from the ethanol\ncalibration curve are estimated without considering the ethanol\npresent in ethyl acetate. Figure 4a,b shows the linearity\nachieved for methanol and ethanol in the concentration range\n0.195−100 g/L. Table 5 shows the parameters obtained for the\ncalibration curves of the two analytes extracted using K2CO3\nand ethyl acetate.\nThe constant EE attained for methanol extraction supports\nthe linearity of the calibration curve attained for this method.\nFurthermore, it is worthy to know the influence of CEtAc on the\ncalibration curve of ethanol. A linear correlation can be made\nbetween the concentration of ethanol in the extract estimated\npreviously (Cextract) and peak area. As can be seen in Figure 5,\nthe response is linear with an R2 value of 0.998, indicating a\ngood correlation. Table 5 shows the data indicating the\nlinearity parameters attained for methanol and ethanol\nconcentration studied.\nLimit of Quantification and Limit of Detection.\nAccording to the International Council for Harmonisation of\nTechnical Requirements for Pharmaceuticals for Human Use\n(ICH) guidelines,37 the LOQ is defined as the lowest\nconcentration of the analyte present in the sample that can\nbe detected and measured with an acceptable level of precision\nand accuracy. Therefore, the LOQ value is taken as the lowest\nvalue on the linearity curve that gives an R2 value higher than\n0.99. As a result, the LOQ estimated from the calibration curve\nis 0.195 g/L for both methanol and ethanol. To confirm the\nreproducibility and accuracy of the measurement, the selected\nconcentration (0.195 g/L) of methanol and ethanol was\nextracted 10 times, and each processed sample was injected\nthree times using the selected GC−FID method.
