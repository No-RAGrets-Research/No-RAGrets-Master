    "caption": "In order to investigate the effect of sodium formate concentration on ethane-to-ethanol \nconversion, reactions were conducted with 2.4 g DCW/L of methanotrophic cells with various \nconcentrations of sodium formate (Figure 3). The replenishment of NADH by supplying sodium \nformate increased the ethanol titer in ethane-to-ethanol conversion by transferring electrons to the \nMMO [21]. The formation of ethanol was enhanced as the formate concentration increased until 80 \nmM. However, formate concentration above 80 mM was not profitable for ethane oxidation and \nresulted in a decrease of ethanol concentration. This was probably due to the high concentration of \nNa-formate that causes the disruptions of intracytoplasmic membranes where pMMO binds [21]. An \n80 mM formate was chosen for maximum ethanol production.",
