The conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol is energy-intensive and requires reducing equivalent to push the reaction along against energy laws.

By alternate reaction and regeneration, the results show that resting cell of M. trichosporium IMV 3011 can be used for many times to catalyze the reduction of carbon dioxide, in which the origin of the reducing equivalent is methane. It is possible to theoretically deduce that the overall reaction for methanol synthesis can be completed by biocatalysis using greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide and methane) as raw materials without adding hydrogen.

Methanol can be produced chemically via methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etcll-s) Synthesis of methanol from carbon dioxide has several obvious advantages. For example, carbon dioxide is one of the greenhouse gases, which have been theorized to contribute to global warming. However, the conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol is fundamentally difficult to achieve under mild condition in chemical catalysis. Conventional methods for synthesizing methanol from CO, suffer from certain drawbacks such as inefficiencies, costs, high energy consumption and the need for special equipment adapted for high temperature or highly corrosive environments. Enzymatically coupled sequential reduction of CO, to methanol, using a series of reaction catalyzed by three different dehydrogenases, particularly appealing. In the process, the ability of the dehydrogenases to catalyze the reverse reactions in the presence of an excess of reducing equivalent has been exploited to facilitate reductions of CO, that are difficult to achieve using traditional chemical methods. However, the process presents a number of technical problems, for example, in order to keep the conversion process going, costly reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) must be used as reducing equivalent for each dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction. NADH is depleted in the reaction and subsequently more NADH must be added. Also, it is very difficult to control the multi-step reaction in a given reaction sequence and to proportion the suitable enzyme dosage. In addition, intermediates of the pathway may be used in other reactions, diluted and exposed to bulk solvent where they may be degraded.",

Thus, reducing equivalents, substrates and intermediates have shorter distances to travel to each enzyme. So no formaldehyde or formic acid was observed in the CO, incubations. The oxidation of methane is catalyzed by methane monooxygenases (MMO), which are classical monooxygenases that utilize two reducing equivalents to split the O-O bonds of dioxygen. One of the oxygen atoms is reduced to form HO and the other is incorporated into methane to form CH,OH|3).

The result suggests that methane can be simultaneously oxidized into methanol during reduction of CO, to methanol and the further oxidation of methanol can be perfectly inhibited in the presence of an excess of CO,.

      "orig": "For maintenance of methanol biosynthesis for a long time, methane was selected as a substrate for reducing equivalent regeneration. The inviable cell suspension of M. trichosporium IMV 3011 was in vivo regenerated with methane and air (1:10, v/v) in the flask for 12 h at 32°C. After the regeneration process, the cell suspension was continuously (or immediately) used to produce methanol. As shown in Fig. 3, the rapid resumption of reduction activity of the inviable cells suggests that a rapid process (reducing equivalent regeneration) was responsible, rather than slower processes (generation of additional cells or of dehydrogenase enzyme). As shown in Fig. 2, the inviable cell still partly retained the ability to synthesize methanol from CO, after 12 h incubation without methane. It is suspected that the methanotrophic bacteria may rely on their endogenous reserves (eg., lipid inclusions) for a source of electrons and energy during starvation.",
      "text": "For maintenance of methanol biosynthesis for a long time, methane was selected as a substrate for reducing equivalent regeneration. The inviable cell suspension of M. trichosporium IMV 3011 was in vivo regenerated with methane and air (1:10, v/v) in the flask for 12 h at 32°C. After the regeneration process, the cell suspension was continuously (or immediately) used to produce methanol.
