Among selected methanotrophs M. alcaliphilum showed maximum methanol tolerance of 6% v/v along with maximum methanol production of 307.90 mg/L and 247.37 mg/L on pure methane and biogas respectively. Activity of methane monooxygenase and formate dehydrogenase enzymes in M. alcaliphilum was signi /uniFB01 cantly higher up to 98.40 nmol/min/ mg cells and 0.87 U/mg protein, respectively. Biotransformation trials in 14 L fermentor resulted in increased methanol production up to 418 and 331.20 mg/L, with yield coef /uniFB01 cient 0.83 and 0.71 mg methanol/mg of pure methane and biogas respectively.

  "Greenhouse gas emission (GHG) due to anthropogenic or natural processes is harmful for the environment. In various natural and anthropogenic processes 900 Tg methane emission signi /uniFB01 -cantly affects climate change (1). Valorisation of these gases into value added products can be an ideal scenario for decarbonization and bio-economy. Biogas is one of the potentially accessible GHG with methane (50 e 70%) and carbon dioxide (25 e 50%) as its major constituents (2). Industrially biogas is produced from major feedstocks like distillery spent wash, food waste, municipal solid waste, sugars, and bio-oil industries. In addition to these bio-based waste residues, second generation feedstocks from agricultural residues like sugarcane bagasse, rice straw, corn cobs, sorghum straw, cotton stalk and others also have the potential to produce signi /uniFB01 cant quantities of biogas. Anaerobic digestion of such agriculture residues and industrial waste into biogas provides a sustainable",

Methanotrophic organisms which are known to utilize methane as sole source of carbon can be used to develop technology for biological valorization of methane (1,4,5). Methanotrophs have been demonstrated previously for their",
  "ability to produce wide variety of products including methanol, ectoin, polyhydroxy butyrate, 2,3-butanediol, single cell protein, carotenoids, vitamin B12, lactic acid and electricity generation (3,6 e 8). Biobased methanol is a potential biofuel because of its properties like high octane number, lesser pollutant emission and compatibility in present automobile engines (9). Methane is also known as a fuel but the advantages of methanol like high energy density (400-fold) and its ease of transportation justi /uniFB01 es methanol production from methane (10). Along with CH4, methanol production has also been reported using CO2 as well as mixture of GHGs (5,11,12). Furthermore, the use of methanol derivatives as fuel additives and feedstock for fuel production is an established concept. Due to potential of methanol as a biofuel and its conversion to several intermediate chemicals, methanol is an ideal product from methane (9,13). Methanotrophs metabolize methane to formaldehyde via",
  "methanol and gets assimilated by either ribulose monophosphate (type I) or serine (type II) as primary pathway (14). As conversion of methane to methanol is the /uniFB01 rst step of methanotroph metabolism, methanol production is essentially a biotransformation reaction. Several efforts to produce methanol using different methanotrophs belonging to type I and type II categories have been reported previously (15,16).

Table 1 (12,15,16,18,22 e 25) shows recent literature summary of yield, titer and speci /uniFB01 c productivity of methanol production by different methanotrophs. Studies on inhibition of methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), co-culture biotransformation, use of methane vector and regeneration of co-factor from formate have been reported to improve methanol production (1,16,20,26). Although several studies have been explored towards production of bio-methanol, the comparison of methanol production between different strains is dif /uniFB01 cult due to variation in culturing protocols, varying cell concentration in biotransformation reaction and supply of reducing agent. Important factors like selection of methanotrophic strain, from a wide diversity of methanotroph and characteristics like methanol tolerance have not been systematically investigated so far. Methanol being a bulk chemical and its",
  "production process must be designed to incur the lowest possible cost. Selection of suitable methanotrophic platform can play a key critical role in minimizing process requirements and operational costs. Key characteristics of methanotroph like optimum temperature for growth, methanol tolerance, methane conversion rate, titer, yield and productivity can have an impact on the overall cost of the bioprocess. In the present study, an industrially suitable organism was systematically selected from wide diversity of genus and species of methanotrophs. Selected strains were investigated for methanol tolerance, requirements of reducing energy and optimization of MDH inhibitors. Methanol production using biogas generated on second generation feedstock was also evaluated.

  "updated from previous published reports (27,28). These reports provided data on phylogenetic and physiological characteristics of diverse and pure isolates of methanotrophs from wide variety of habitats. Methanotrophic strains were grouped in different categories (Fig. 1) and assessed for their ability to produce methanol based on industrially relevant characteristics. Methanotrophs were segregated into major groups as gamma-proteobacteria (group A, 45 strains) and alphaproteobacteria (group B, 15 strains). Mesophilic strains from each group were further selected to design fermentation process under ambient conditions for industrial product like methanol. Selection of mesophilic methanotrophs resulted in reduction of relevant strains to 33 and 13 from group A and B, respectively (Fig. 1). As MMO enzyme activity is the most important factor affecting methane to methanol conversion, it was selected to understand variation in types of MMO within different groups. Methanotrophs were",
  "further segregated into subgroups based on the presence and absence of particulate form of methane monooxygenase enzyme. All members of group A possess pMMO, whereas 11 strains of group B were found to have pMMO (group B1) and the rest two strains possess only soluble form of MMO (group B2). Out of three subunits of pMMO, pmoA is considered as a conserved subunit and has been used for studying diversity of methanotrophs by construction of phylogenetic tree (31). Amino acid sequence of pmoA was analyzed using neighbor joining analysis (Fig. 2) to /uniFB01 nd taxonomic difference within groups. Analysis of pmoA sequence separated group A into A1 (6 species) and A2 (22 species), while analyzing group B, Methylocystis bryophila was found to be diverse from rest of group B1.

Selected strains were further evaluated for methanol tolerance and methanol production ability. Methanol tolerance Methanol tolerance of selected strains in the presence and absence of methane was analyzed and different degree of tolerance was observed in each methanotrophic strain (Fig. 3). In both presence and absence of methane, selected strains showed methanol tolerance at or above 4% v/v.

Biogas to methanol conversion Methanol production was further evaluated on biogas produced on rice straw and sugarcane bagasse. In biotransformation using biogas, methanol production decreased in all methanotrophs (Fig. 5B). Amongst all methanotrophs, M. alcaliphilum produced maximum methanol up to 204.98 mg/L and 247.37 mg/L with biogas produced from rice straw and sugarcane bagasse, respectively. In comparison of pure",
  "methane, methanol production by different methanotrophs was found to be decreased by more than 34% and 20% on biogas generated from rice straw and sugarcane bagasse, respectively. Redox regeneration for methanol production The electrons required for methane to methanol conversion could be supplied through NADH generated by sodium formate to CO2 conversion (26,33). Increase in sodium formate concentration affected methanol production positively but use of higher concentration of formate could not increase methanol accumulation in the presence of MDH inhibitor (16,23). To investigate this further, we estimated formate to methanol ef /uniFB01 ciency as mentioned earlier in the Materials and methods section. To evaluate redox regeneration ef /uniFB01 ciency, M. alcaliphilum was selected based on its higher methanol tolerance and methanol production ability. M. alcaliphilum was evaluated for methanol production against different sodium formate concentration in the presence and absence of",
  "ammonium chloride (Fig. 6A). Ef /uniFB01 ciency was estimated in moles of methanol produced against moles of utilized formate. In the presence of ammonium chloride, 80 mmol L /C0 1 sodium formate showed 30.59% redox regeneration ef /uniFB01 ciency, whereas in the absence of inhibitor, although increase in methanol accumulation was observed with increase in sodium formate, the redox regeneration ef /uniFB01 ciency was found to be decreasing (Fig. 6A). DCW after biotransformation reaction was analyzed and no signi /uniFB01 cant change in biomass concentration was observed, indicating formate was used only as source of reducing power and was not utilized for cell growth.

Except for the availability of methane, no other condition rationalizes the widespread abundance of methanotrophs. Cultivation at different temperature, pH, osmolarity and combination of the key factors determines the diversity of methanotroph. It is dif /uniFB01 cult to experimentally evaluate each methanotroph from wide",
  "genera and habitats to identify few ef /uniFB01 cient and industrially suitable methanotrophs for methanol production. In the present study we applied multiple segregation and selection criteria to identify representative methanotrophs based on important characteristics. Factors like physiological conditions for growth and diversity in methane utilization was used as the basis to segregate and select representative methanotrophs. To select suitable methanotrophic strain, data of 60 aerobic methanotrophs spread over 23 genera was analyzed. Out of 60 methanotrophic strains, particulate form of methane monooxygenase was found in 56 strains and the remaining 4 strains from Methylocella and Methyloferula genus possess only soluble form of MMO for methane utilization (27,28). Methanotrophs are known to have higher methane af /uniFB01 nity and utilization when pMMO enzyme is selectively expressed (14). Considering the presence of pMMO activity and its importance for methane utilization, pMMO",
  "based comparison of methanotroph is highly justi /uniFB01 ed. Further the sequence availability of each pMMO subunit from different methanotrophs could be useful for detailed enzyme characterisation and improvement of methane utilization ability is possible using genetic or enzyme engineering approaches. It was observed that the A1 group comprised strains from Methylomonas genus along with Methylomarinum vadi , whereas all other mesophilic gammaproteobacterium methanotrophs separated in the A2 group (Fig. 2). Although total MMO activity of methanotrophs in each sub-group can have wide variation, the diversity of pmoA sequence was used to segregate strains in different subgroups and representative from each subgroup was selected for detailed experimental investigation. To assess methanol production ability of methanotrophs, methanol tolerance should be considered as an important aspect due to challenges associated with product inhibition. Most of the earlier studies on methanol",
  "tolerance have been done using methanol as a substrate (35,36). However, for the production of methanol, better understanding of methanol tolerance in the presence of methane is desirable. To the best of our knowledge, methanol tolerance in the presence of methane has not been investigated previously. The present study on the methanol tolerance of methanotrophs showed high tolerance both in the presence and absence of methane (Fig. 3). Interestingly, in all four selected 5 466 KULKARNI ET AL. J.

Carbon sources used were methane ( /uniFB01 lled bars), biogas from sugarcane bagasse (bars with horizontal lines) and biogas from rice straw (open bars). Data is mean representation of three replicates and standard deviation is displayed as error bars. methanotrophs, methanol tolerance was found to be decreasing in the presence of methane. In the absence",
  "of methane, methanol tolerance of M. alcaliphilum (6% v/v) was found to be in the similar range as reported for Methylotuvimicrobium buryatense (7% v/v) (36). Interestingly, both strains are halotolerant and belong to Methylotuvimicrobium genus. Another similar observation between M. buryatense and methanotrophs investigated in this study was achievement of maximum growth rate at 1% (v/v) methanol (Fig. 3). For increasing methanol accumulation, the optimal inhibitor concentration is important for complete inhibition of MDH enzyme. Methanol production was found to be decreasing beyond the optimal inhibitor concentration (Fig. 4). This effect could be due to inhibition of MMO or formate dehydrogenase (FDH) enzyme which is responsible for supplying reducing energy for MMO activity (26). On comparison of methanol production ability using pure methane, methanol production per gram of biomass by M. alcaliphilum was up to 153.95 mg methanol/g DCW, whereas M. methanica , M. trichosporium and",
  "M. silvestris produced up to 90.49, 149.33 and 88.55 mg methanol/g DCW, respectively (Fig. 4F). As all enzymes required for biotransformation are intracellular, it is important to compare methanol production ability based on speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity and methane to methanol yield. In earlier published reports, methanotrophs have been reported irrespective of important industrial parameters like tolerance, conversion yield, speci /uniFB01 c productivity and MMO activity (Table 1).

Data is mean representation of three replicates and standard deviation /C20 10%. 1.10 g/L was reported with relatively lower speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity (22), whereas in the present study, use of 2 g/L dry cells of M. trichosporium resulted into 1.94 fold higher speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity up to 3.11 mg/g DCW/h. In another study with isolate from Methylocaldum genus, higher speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity and titer was reported, but the lower yield of methane to methanol conversion was",
  "achieved (Table 1). All previous studies of methanol production were performed in less than 300 mL reaction volume in serum bottles or smaller vessels (Table 1). In our studies with 3 L reaction volume M. alcaliphilum showed 41.36% and 35.35% methane to methanol molar conversion on pure methane and biogas with speci /uniFB01 c methanol productivity of 8.71 and 6.90 mg/g DCW/h and yield coef /uniFB01 cient of 0.83 and 0.71 mg methanol/mg methane, respectively. Although overall carbon requirement is higher for methanol production, it could be reduced with approaches like strain engineering, improvement in MMO activity and expression of redox regeneration pathways. After the selection of industrially suitable methanotrophic strain, further enhancement in methanol production can be possible using different process modi /uniFB01 cations like use of paraf /uniFB01 n oil (37), immobilization, coculture, methane vector and cells recycling (1,18,20,25). It was necessary to maintain favorable",
  "conditions for MMO activity during growth as well as biotransformation phase for achieving the maximum methanol production. In the present study, MMO activity of M. alcaliphilum observed to be 3.07, 1.43 and 2.05 fold higher than that of M. methanica , M. trichosporium and VOL. 132, 2021 SELECTION OF METHANOTROPH FOR METHANOL PRODUCTION 467 M. silvestris , respectively (Fig. 5A). Speci /uniFB01 c MMO activity of M. trichosporium and M. alcaliphilum was found to be in the same range as reported in the previous studies of methane utilization using these methanotrophs (29,38). One of the major factors affecting activity of enzyme is the substrate used during growth phase. Methanotrophs grown on different substrates have shown signi /uniFB01 cant variation in gene and energy regulation (35,38,39). Decrease in MMO activity of M. trichosporium on shifting substrate from methane to methanol (35) prompted maintenance of unlimiting concentration of methane and oxygen in both gas and liquid",
  "phase. Supply of fresh methane-oxygen mixture during growth phase at frequent intervals ensured continuous substrate availability in liquid phase. Biotransformation in stirred tank bioreactor improved mixing as well as gas liquid mass transfer. Continuous availability of methane and oxygen resulted in an increase up to 35% in methanol production by M. alcaliphilum as compared to that observed in serum bottles (Figs. 5B and 6B). Methanol production ability of methanotrophs was also found to be affected by factors like stage of cell harvesting, culture motility and time lag between harvesting and biotransformation. We observed that cell harvested during the exponential phase of cell growth produced higher methanol as compared to stationary phase. In trials with M. alcaliphilum negative effect on methanol production in biotransformation was observed if the cell motility was not observed at the time of harvest. Similarly, in case of M. trichosporium , the presence of spores affected",
  "methanol production in biotransformation. Loss of motility and release of spores were observed typically during stationary phase cultures of M. alcaliphilum and M. trichosporium , respectively. For a biotransformation reaction, use of cells stored under cold conditions is expected to preserve enzyme activity. However, in our studies on multiple occasions, methane grown cells stored under cold conditions could not produce methanol and had to be utilized immediately for ef /uniFB01 cient biotransformation (data not provided). Detailed investigation to understand effect of these factors on methanol production need to be conducted. To address the limitation of required electrons for MMO based redox reaction, supplementation of sodium formate has been an established way of increasing methanol accumulation (26,33). To investigate this further, we estimated redox regeneration ef /uniFB01 ciency and observed loss of ability to utilize formate after a threshold concentration resulting in no",
  "increase in methanol production (Fig. 6A). It was also observed that redox regeneration ef /uniFB01 ciency was up to 24 e 31%. This suggests that all the reducing equivalents generated by external addition of formate could not be utilized by methanotrophs for conversion of methane to methanol. This could be possible due to imbalance between NADH/H þ ions produced by FDH and associated reducing equivalent requirement for MMO activity. Excess NADH/H þ provided by formate supplementation could be most likely used for other cellular activities like nongrowth related energy maintenance, nutrient transportation, mobility and other metabolism related energy requirements. With increase in formate concentration, methanol accumulation was observed even in the absence of MDH inhibitors. This could be due to increase in MMO activity or due to inhibition of MDH activity by formate. In our studies, we found supplementation of formate was more critical for methanol accumulation as opposed to",
  "inhibition of MDH activity highlighting continuous supply of reducing equivalent is the most important aspect of methane to methanol biotransformation (Fig. 6A). As continuous supply of formate will increase CO2 emission, effect of CO2 on MMO and FDH activity need to be investigated. Globally, methanol is produced from fossil based feedstocks like coal and natural gas. Both these feedstocks require a twostep process of methanol production involving syngas generation and conversion of syngas to methanol. Multi-step processes based on syngas to methanol require metal catalyst, high temperature and pressure conditions along with cleaning of syngas leading to large capital and operating expenditure (40). A biotechnological route based on methanotrophic organisms can provide a milder and safer fermentation-based technology for methanol production from sustainable feedstocks like biogas. Considering biogas as a potential methane rich feedstock, it was evaluated for methanol production. Use",
  "of biogas reduced methanol production signi /uniFB01 cantly which could be due to the presence of CO2, H2S or any other inhibitors (Fig. 5B). Previously, conversion of biogas to methanol has been reported to be adversely affected due to the presence of impurities like H2S in biogas, as well as inconsistent composition of biogas due to variation in feed like municipal solid waste (2,41). Inhibitory effect of H2S and CO2 on methanol production was reported with other methanotrophs at H2S concentration less than 0.13% (2,12). Studies of Methylosinus sporium on pure methane produced 131.04 mg/L (4.09 mmol L /C0 1 ) methanol and remained unchanged on use of raw biogas with 20% methane concentration (12), while use of raw biogas with 30% and above methane concentration reduced the methanol production by more than 55% (1.82 mmol L /C0 1 ). In our studies with M. alcaliphilum, use of biogas (33% methane) resulted in only 19.77% reduction in methanol production (Fig. 5B). This is the /uniFB01",
  "rst study reporting methanol production on biogas generated from second-generation feedstock like sugarcane bagasse and rice straw. Production of methanol using biogas produced from such agricultural waste can add value along with reduction in GHG emissions. Apart from valorization of methane, CO2 present in biogas is the other major GHG component present in large quantities. Conversion of CO2 to methanol can be achieved using immobilized cultures of methanotrophs as reported in previous studies (5). Other approaches like co-culture of methanotrophs with cyanobacteria can also be a promising way to utilize maximum carbon present in the biogas. Our study presents a systematic approach for selection of industrially important methanotroph for methanol production. Overall representative selection was based on information related to microbial characterization and availability of genetic data in literature. Selected representative strains from wide habitats covering multiple genera were",
  "investigated for key characteristics like product inhibition, product formation potential and variation in source of substrate. Haloalkaliphilic organism M. alcaliphilum showed high methanol tolerance and methanol production ability on pure methane as well as biogas. Further improvement in methanol production is possible with M. alcaliiphilum due to availability of the genome sequence, genome-scale model with metabolic /uniFB02 ux prediction and genetic engineering toolkit (7,38). We propose M. alcaliphilum as a potential methanotrophic platform for methanol as well as value added chemicals.
