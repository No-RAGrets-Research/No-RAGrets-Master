  "wastewater treatment for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). Biogas from wastewater treatment plant was provided, instead of purified CH4, to provide operation and maintenance conditions of bio-catalyst reaction for efficient biological carbon fixation by bacterial community using methane and CO2 . This study assessed the conditions to induce type X methanotrophs that can use CO2 as a carbon source, as dominant species in the bacterial community and continuously and effectively supply reducing equivalents required for the conversion of CO2 to methanol within the system. Herein, the results of inducing efficient co-existence of methanotrophs, Methylophilus , and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria cluster in the bacterial community were shown. Keywords: methanotrophs; carbon fixation; Methylophilus ; ammonia-oxidizing bacteria; CCUS 1. Introduction Methanotrophs can be used for various purposes, such as purification of environments polluted by chlorinated hydrocarbons or harmful",
  "heavy metals [1-3], removal of methane, which is a more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide [4], biological nitrogen fixation and denitrification [5], production of bio-methanol, [6-15], and production of bioplastics, such as poly-3-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) [16,17]. Methanotrophs are bacteria that play an important role in the sustainability of the global environment. Previous studies on methanol production by methanotrophs mainly focused on a single species (mainly type II methanotrophs) and used nitrate mineral salts medium (NMS medium) or ammonium mineral salts medium (AMS medium) [18], which are chemically defined culture media [6-15]. However, chemically defined culture media and commercial media are expensive and generate chemical wastewater. In addition, to create the optimum conditions for a specific single species to enable it to continuously survive as an absolutely dominant species, manipulations, such as sterilization and blocking of external contaminations, are",
  "necessary, which are difficult to be carried out in uncontrolled environments outside the laboratory. To date, high-purity methane (CH4 > 97%) has been used in the production of methanol by methanotrophs. Such production requires purification and separation processes, which are costly. In other words, previous studies lack consideration of realistic alternatives for economic feasibility and can only be conducted in controlled laboratory settings. To improve economic feasibility, certain studies have used biogas, instead of high-purity methane, as a realistic alternative, while others have sought to produce methanol from Catalysts 2021 , 11 , 1342. https://doi.org/10.3390/catal11111342 https://www.mdpi.com/journal/catalysts Catalysts 2021 , 11 , 1342 2 of 15 methane, among other gases that form crude biogas [15-20]. However, these studies also targeted specific species to methanotrophs, limiting the application of the methods outside of laboratories. In a previous study, for the first",
  "time, we used sewage flowing into an urban wastewater treatment plant as a culture medium, as well as biogas generated from a wastewater treatment plant in bio-methanol production [21]. In subsequent studies, we produced methanol using biogas as a carbon source and sewage as a culture medium and proposed a treatment process using the generated methanol as a carbon source for denitrification [22,23]. Furthermore, we investigated the bacterial community formation and the dominance of effectives species in reject water containing high concentrations of ammonia generated by anaerobic digesters in wastewater treatment plants, as well as the mutual roles and correlations between each bacterial cluster involved in the process [24]. Compared to previous studies that used methane (a pure synthetic gas) and chemically defined or commercially sold culture media, our previous studies using biogas generated by wastewater treatment plants as a carbon source, as well as nutrient-rich sewage and",
  "wastewater as culture media, were different [21-24]. The biggest difference was that maintaining an effective single species as a dominant species, using wastewater and biogas, was not possible owing to biological contamination and interference, unlike in controlled laboratory environments. Bacterial clusters of different taxa accumulated to form a bacterial community in which the bacteria are interdependent. The formed bacterial communities were useful in methanol production and wastewater processing [21-24]. Another key difference from controlled laboratory conditions, where only pure methane was used, was the existence of new effectives species under high CO2 ratio of ≥ 30%. The key species in the bacterial community were the Methylophilus strains that used the methanol produced by methanotrophs. Additionally, new species of methanotrophs classified as type X have been observed in experiments using biogas, compared with those using only methane [24]. We observed that type X",
  "methanotrophs could convert CO2 into methanol if a reducing equivalent was present in the reaction system [25-28]. In the current study, for the effective use of CO2 in biological carbon fixation and wastewater treatment and for carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS), we explored biological carbon fixation using bacterial community and biogas. The concept of CO2 fixation by methanotrophs first emerged following the discovery a new methanotroph species that produces methanol from CO2 through the Calvin-BensonBassham (CBB) cycle in the Verrumicrobia phylum. However, this species is a thermophilic methanotroph that inhabits high-temperature environments, such as volcanoes and hot springs; thus, it cannot be widely used for CO2 fixation [25-27]. However, some methanotrophs, such as type X methanotrophs, may be induced to become parts of bacterial community and use CO2 as a substrate to reduce excess CO2 into methanol [28]. In the first step of the process, methanotrophs",
  "proliferate using methane as a carbon substrate. In the second step, CO2 is reduced to methanol by the generated methanotrophs. Reduction of CO2 to methanol is the reverse reaction of methane oxidation to CO2. To reduce CO2 to methanol, a high reducing power is required to induce a reaction that is against the law of energy. In other words, NADH is required to reduce CO2 to formaldehyde, and pyrroloquinoline quinol (PQQH2) is needed to reduce formaldehyde to methanol [25-28]. In this study, we aimed to assess the optimum conditions for generating the driving force of reverse reaction against the law of energy in bacterial community through experiments, as well as to use this reaction to biologically fix and remove greenhouse gases, such as CH4 and CO2, for effective use in wastewater treatment. For these purposes, we efficiently maintained the bacterial community using biogas mainly consisting of CH4 and CO2 instead of manufactured or purified CH4 as carbon sources for bacteria. We",
  "also established the optimum conditions for generating methanotrophs capable of using CO2 as a carbon source, such as type X methanotrophs, as the dominant species in the bacterial community while efficiently and continuously providing the reducing power required to convert CO2 to methanol.

Characteristics of CO2 Utilization by Methanotrophs through the Methane Oxidation Process Residual concentrations of CH4 and CO2 in the flask headspace were measured to indirectly estimate the utilization rates of CH4 and CO2 with reaction time. The initial condition of culture medium and biogas was maintained, not changed every 24 h. The relative distribution of Type X methanotrophs strains was highest in the microbial sludge where cultured cells were centrifuged and dehydrated under the conditions of CH4:CO2 ratio 2.5, as shown in Figure 5. The bacteria community was inoculated with 864 mg · L -1 based on the mixed liquid suspended solid (MLSS; Activated Bacteria Sludge). In the initial 0-24 hr stage, the CO2 consumption rate was -1.32 mL CO2 · day -1 , which",
  "inversely increased the CO2 content in the flask headspace. In the 72-96 h stage, as the CH4 consumption rate was significantly lowered from the initial 5.30 to 0.14 mL CH4 · day -1 , the CO2 consumption rate increased up to 2.37 mL CO2 · day -1 . This implies that CO2 was consumed at the same reducing equivalent as NADH formed in the methane oxidation process by Type X after methane was depleted. In this study, although the changes in CH4 and CO2 utilization rates with reaction time was not monitored all time, the difference in the consumption rate of the two gases was evident in Table 3. The initial increase in CO2 in the head space may have been due to bacteria ′ s respiration, which indirectly showed that the consumption rate of each gas was different, depending on the elapsed reaction, when methane and CO2 coexisted. The CO2 in the flask headspace rather increases due to the respiration of bacteria. Despite the initial CO2 content of 31.3%, the CO2 content of the biogas decreased",
  "to 22.6% after 96 h. From this result, the negative CO2 balance can be estimated by Type X methanotrophs. Table 3. Changes in methane and CO2 consumption rates according to reaction time intervals. Data represent the means ± standard deviations of three replicates (n = 3). Based on these findings, gas composition ratio according to reaction time was established to favor methane oxidation in the first half of the operation time, as well as to reduce and remove CO2 in the second half using reducing equivalents (NADH, PHB) formed through methane oxidation. After completion of methane oxidation by methanotrophs, reducing equivalents accumulated in bacterial cells as a source of CO2. Reducing equivalents were quantitatively confirmed from the amount of methanol produced. After methane oxidation reaction at a CH4/CO2/O2 ratio of 1:0.5:1, bacterial cells were centrifuged, as described in Section 2.1. Next, 835 mg · L -1 MLSS of dehydrated microbial sludge was added to the AMS medium.",
  "Subsequently, only CO2 and O2 (1:1), without CH4, were supplied into the head space for assessment of methanol production (Figure 6), which was then compared with that under control conditions using biogas. The NAD accumulated in bacterial cells existed in two forms: the oxidized and reduced forms [abbreviated as NAD + and NADH (H for hydrogen), respectively; NAD + + Formate ⇔ NADH.

Materials and Methods 3.1. Cultivation of Bacterial Consortium Activated sludge collected from an aeration tank in a wastewater treatment plant was used as a microbial consortium culture. Wet activated sludge was filtered through a sieve (No. 50; 300 µ m) to remove large-sized substances and was placed in several 500-mL flasks. Biogas was injected into 30% of the",
  "upper space filled with air, and the product was stored at 4 ◦ C for use in subsequent experiments. As ammonium was the material of interest in this study, AMS medium containing a high concentration (10 mM) of ammonium chloride was prepared in the laboratory and used as a nitrogen source instead of NMS medium, which is commonly used for culturing methanotrophs [41]. Copper (CuSO4) concentration in the final medium was 20 µ Mfor all medium formulations. The media were buffered to pH 6.8 through the addition of 1.5 mL phosphate buffer (26 g/L KH2PO4, 33 g/L Na2HPO4). Next, 10 g of purified activated sludge sample stored at 4 ◦ C was added to a 350 mL flask containing 200 mL of AMS medium solution. The flask was closed with a silicon stopper, and 20% ( v/v ) of the upper 150 mL space was filled with methane through a gas-tight syringe. The flask was subsequently sealed using a silicone stopper, covered with parafilm, and cultured on a rotary shaker (Lab Champion IS-971R; Champion",
  "Laboratories, Albion, IL, USA). After stirring for 24 h at a culture temperature of 25 ◦ C and stirring speed of 250 rpm, the mixture was allowed to precipitate for 10 min. Next, 100 mL of the mixture was placed in a 350 mL flask containing fresh AMS, and the culture process was repeated six times. The cultured methane-oxidizing bacteria were separated via centrifugation (Centrifuge-416; Dongseo Science, Ltd., Dangjin, Korea) at 2700 × g . The centrifuged pellet was freeze-dried at -55 ◦ C in a freeze dryer (FDS-12003; OPERON, Seoul, Korea) for subsequent use. Cell concentration was determined by measuring the absorbance at a wavelength of 660 nm using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (UV-1600; Shimazu, Japan). The centrifuged pellet was freeze-dried at -55 ◦ C (TFD5505; Ilshin lab., Korea). Different amounts of distilled water were added according to the concentration, and absorbance was measured to prepare a calibration curve. 3.2. Biogas Source Biogas generated from an anaerobic",

The composition ratio of biogas was CH4 (66.9%), CO2 (31.3%), N2 (1.2%), and O2 (0.2%). When it was difficult to control the content of each gas with only biogas and air during the production of mixed gas, CH4 and CO2 were supplied to the biogas from a high-pressure gas tank.

Conclusions This study propose the use of biogas generated from an urban wastewater treatment plant and a bacterial community comprising methanotrophs, Methylophilus , and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria, as an effective method of biological carbon fixation and nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment for CCUS. A significant level (11.2%) of type X methanotroph strains were identified only in methanotrophs cultured with CO2 and biogas. Following culture with CO2 only, higher cell concentration of bacterial community and greater relative ratio of type X methanotrophs were observed with increasing methanol production. At type X methanotroph ratio of 19% and cell concentration of 1025 mg · L -1 , the maximum methanol concentration of 0.41 mM was achieved. The most ideal",

Biological fixation of CO2 by type X methanotrophs was occurred using reducing equivalents, such as NADH, PHB, and NH2OH, which were accumulated in the reactor and cells by methanotrophs (Type I, Type II, and Type X), methylophilus and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria. Based on these findings, it would be possible to set a response system with conditions favorable for the oxidation of methane, methanol, and ammonia in the first half of the operation time and to reduce CO2 using reducing equivalents (NADH, PHB) for biological fixation in the second half of the operation time.
