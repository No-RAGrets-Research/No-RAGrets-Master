Abstract: Sources of methane are numerous, and vary greatly in their use and sustainable credentials. A Jekyll and Hyde character, it is a valuable energy source present as geological deposits of natural gas, however it is also potent greenhouse gas, released during many waste management processes. Gas-to-liquid technologies are being investigated as a means to exploit and monetise non-traditional and unutilised methane sources. The product identified as",
  "having the greatest potential is methanol due to it being a robust, commercially mature conversion process from methane and its beneficial fuel  characteristics.  Commercial  methane  to  methanol  conversion  requires  high  temperatures  and pressures, in an energy intensive and costly process. In contrast methanotrophic bacteria perform the desired transformation under ambient conditions, using methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes. Despite  the  great  potential  of  these  bacteria  a  number  of  biotechnical  difficulties  are  hindering progress towards an industrially suitable process. We have identified five major challenges that exist as barriers to a viable conversion process that, to our knowledge, have not previously been examined as  distinct  process  challenges.  Although  biotechnological  applications  of  methanotrophic  bacteria have been reviewed in part, no review has comprehensively covered progress and challenges for a methane  to  methanol  process  from  an",
  "industrial  perspective.  All  published  examples  to  date  of methanotroph catalysed conversion of methane to methanol are collated, and standardised to allow direct comparison. The focus will be on conversion of methane to methanol by whole-cell, wild type, methanotroph cultures, and the potential for their application in an industrially relevant process.

Introduction Methane is simultaneously a valuable energy resource, significant global waste product and a potent",
  "green-house gas (GHG). The volume of waste methane released from anthropogenic sources is increasing, in addition to natural gas sources becoming increasingly remote and diffuse [1,2]. Gasto-liquid (GTL) technologies are being developed to exploit and monetise a range of underutilised methane resources through chemical conversion to liquid hydrocarbon products that are more readily stored and transported. Methane to methanol conversion is receiving increased research interest due to the drive towards sustainable technologies and renewable fuels. Compared  to  methane,  methanol  can  be  easily  used  as  a  feedstock  for  further  chemical conversion, is suitable for use in the current transportation fuel infrastructure, has a greater energy density,  and  burns  with  fewer  toxic  by-products  [3].  Methanol  is  produced  commercially  from methane via syngas, however the two-step process requires high temperatures (about 900 ° C) and pressures (3 MPa) and as such is energy",
  "intensive [4]. Despite the costs associated with the process, chemical conversion has been successfully commercialised, however the high volumes of methane necessary to make large-scale processes economically viable are not applicable for marginal fields and waste methane sources. In contrast to chemical routes, the oxidation of methane to methanol is performed biologically by methane monooxygenase (MMO) enzymes in a single step at ambient temperature and pressure. Unique  to  methanotrophic  bacteria,  MMO  enzymes  catalyse  the  initial  oxidation  of  methane  to methanol,  ultimately  allowing  the  use  of  methane  as  a  sole  carbon  and  energy  source  [5].  The AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 3 biological conversion offers methane to methanol conversion in an energy efficient and environmentally  benign  manner.  In  addition,  biotechnological  processes  are  well  suited  to  smallscale  operations,  appropriate  for  remote  and  diffuse  methane  sources,",
  "and  require  low  capital investment. The potential to exploit methanotrophs for the partial oxidation of methane to methanol has been explored, however progress towards an industrially relevant biocatalytical process to date has been minimal due to a range of issues. Herein, we have identified five major challenges that exist as barriers to a viable conversion process that, to our knowledge, have not previously been examined as distinct process challenges. This  review  will  comprehensively  analyse  recent  progress  in  these  areas  from  an  industrial perspective, in addition to providing tabulated and standardised data for all published examples  to date  of  the  whole  cell  bioconversion  of  methane  to  methanol  using  methanotrophic  bacteria.  In summary, the potential to exploit methanotrophs in a biotechnological GTL process is vast, however implementation is hindered by the factors identified. Progress in this will be facilitated by the recent shift  in  the",
  "research  community  from  biologically  focused  research  to  take  a  holistic,  engineering approach, and further work is required at the interface of these disciplines. Current innovations and future opportunities are discussed. 2. Setting the scene: the energy and environmental context It  is  now  widely  accepted  that  a  significant  deviation  from  the  unsustainable  global  energy situation is necessary. The scientific consensus is that the Earth's climate is being affected by human activities [6], attributed to the release of GHGs, with atmospheric concentrations at unprecedented levels [6]. Combustion of fossil fuels for energy production is responsible for the majority of GHG emissions,  whilst  also  being  available  as  finite  resources,  and  so  alternative  fuels  that  are  both sustainably sourced and produce lower emissions are of interest. As such, methane has received increased attention from the scientific community. A Jekyll and Hyde character, sources of",
  "methane can be divided into anthropogenic and natural, while there is also a  distinction  between  those  that  are  traditionally  utilised  commercially  and  those  that  result  in atmospheric  and  biogenic  accumulation.  The  resource  most  frequently  exploited  is  geological deposits of fossil formed natural gas, used predominantly for energy generation. As a product of the anaerobic decay of biomass, however, it can be considered either a renewable carbon source or a potent GHG, depending on its final use or treatment. 2.1. Methane sources and uses The main component of natural and shale gases, methane is considered a next-generation carbon feedstock  due  to  the  vast  global  reserves  [7],  with  geological  deposits  of  the  fossil  formed  gas frequently exploited for energy generation. In addition, it is the main constituent of biogas, produced by the microbial digestion of biomass under anaerobic conditions, and as such is a product of many waste  management",
  "processes  and  agricultural  activity  including  enteric  fermentation  and  rice cultivation  [1].  However  methane  is  an  abundant  and  potent  GHG.  The  greatest  source  to  the atmosphere is as a result of anaerobic decay of biomass,  with anthropogenic contribution through AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 4 industrial waste production on the increase [8]. Also the energy sector is responsible for significant methane emissions released during fossil fuel exploration, extraction and transportation. Anthropogenic  methane  emissions  in  2010  were  estimated  to  be  481  billion  m 3 methane, equivalent  in  global  warming  potential  to  6867  Mt  carbon  dioxide  [1],  with  atmospheric  methane concentrations at unprecedented levels, having increased from 715 ppb to 1774 ppb over the past 300 years [6]. This, combined with a global warming potential 25 times greater than carbon dioxide, have resulted  in  methane  being  the  second  most  significant",
  "greenhouse  gas  after  carbon  dioxide, contributing more than one-third of current anthropogenic warming [1]. Methane has a much shorter global atmospheric lifetime (12 years) compared with carbon dioxide (5-200 years) [6], so it would be possible to rapidly reduce atmospheric concentrations through a reduction in emissions. Methane mitigation  strategies  offer  both  the  potential  to  curb  atmospheric  accumulation  and  the  associated climate impact in addition to providing a valuable industrial fuel source and chemical feedstock. Global  natural  gas  production  in  2013  was  estimated  to  be  3369.9  billion  m 3 ,  with  proven reserves  of  185.7  trillion  m 3 [9].  Of  this  it  is  estimated  that  between  30%  and  80%  is  'stranded gas' [10], defined as natural gas that is wasted or unused because the gas field may be too small or remote for production to be economically feasible [2]. An additional environmental concern is the considerable amount of associated",
  "gas that is flared or vented during oil production encouraging the implementation of restrictions on such processes. In 2008, 139 billion m 3 of natural gas was flared globally;  equal  to  4%  of  global  natural  gas  production,  and  resulted  in  the  release  of  more  than 278 Mt of carbon dioxide [11]. Combining the volume of anthropogenic waste methane emissions, stranded and associated gas demonstrates  the  huge  amount  of  unutilised  global  methane  sources  and  the  waste  of  a  valuable resource. 2.2. Gas-to-liquid technologies One difficulty in the use of methane is that it occurs as a gas under ambient conditions (boiling point  -164  ° C)  and  so  storage  and  transportation  are  costly,  further  compounded  for  diffuse  and remote  non-traditional  sources.  Conversion  to  compressed  natural  gas  (CNG)  or  liquefied  natural gas (LNG) are energy intensive and require large capital investment, in addition to being hazardous due to their high pressure",
  "(21-25 MPa) and low temperature (-164 ° C) [2]. This, and the potential to monetise unutilised methane sources has initiated interest in GTL technologies to chemically convert methane to liquid hydrocarbon products that are more readily transported. The most widely deployed, commercially  demonstrated  GTL  technologies  utilise  the  Fischer-Tropsch  conversion  process  to produce  diesel, naphtha  and  waxes  [10], although other conversion  technologies are being investigated  to  generate  products  including  methanol,  dimethyl  ether  (DME)  and  olefins.  GTL processes offer  market diversification and an opportunity to harness  remote natural gas resources, although high costs, price risks, reliability and technical difficulties have hindered implementation [4]. A number of factors impact the suitability and success of such technologies including scale, capital cost  and  potential  markets  for  products  [4].  Large-scale  projects  offer  economies  of  scale  but",
  "typically  require  high  capital  investment  and  a  constant  high  volume  input  of  methane,  not  often available at remote sources. Ultimately, the commercial viability of a plant is determined by natural AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 5 MTBE Formaldehyde Dehydrogenation oxidation Distillates 1 Oligomerisation gas and product prices. Volatility and uncertainty in these markets make justifying the large capital investment  problematic.  Interest  in  small-scale,  modular  GTL  units  has  increased  for  reasons contrasting large-scale projects, such as the suitability for use at low volume gas sources and reduced capital investment. It is anticipated that unit cost and reliability will have the greatest impact on the uptake and success of such technologies [4]. DME aromatisation 2.3. Methanol as a sustainable liquid fuel Direct use Conversion to  methanol  is  an  attractive  option  due  to  the  range  of  applications  and  growing market; global methanol",
  "demand reached 70 Mt in 2015 [12]. Traditionally used as a solvent and feedstock, methanol is utilised in the synthesis of industrially relevant  compounds  including  acetic  acid,  formaldehyde,  methyl  tert-butyl  ether  (MTBE),  and dimethyl ether (DME), whilst the methanol-to-olefin (MTO) process can be used to produce ethylene or  propylene  which  can  be  further  processed  into  a  range  of  hydrocarbon  and  organic  polymeric materials (Figure 1). Figure  1. Possible  industrial  transformations  from  methanol,  including  production processes and products [13]. Methanol also offers great potential as an energy carrier or fuel, with an energy density greater than that of methane (15.6 MJ L -1 and 36.6 ×  10 -3 MJ L -1 respectively). There are five main fuel applications for methanol: directly as a transportation fuel; blended with petrol; converted to DME to be used as a diesel replacement; in the production of biodiesel via trans-esterification; in fuel cells to",
  "generate electricity. The current energy situation has increased interest in methanol in transportation fuel applications due to the potential for sustainable, carbon neutral sources, low cost compared to > Gasoline AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 6 other fuels, and clean burning [14], in addition to offering a range of advantages over both methane, and  current  petrochemical  fuels.  Methanol  exhibits  favourable  combustion  properties,  increased engine  performance  and  greater  efficiencies  over  those  achieved  with  gasoline  [3].  Another advantage of methanol over petroleum based fuels is that it is considered both safer, with a lower or comparable toxicity, and more environmentally benign in case of uncontrolled release as it is highly biodegradable [15]. Perhaps the greatest advantage of methanol as a fuel is related to the GHG emission reduction potential. Comparison of life cycle carbon intensity analysis shows that emissions from methanol as a fuel are",
  "heavily dependent on the feedstock source. Methanol from natural gas has slightly lower carbon  emissions  compared  with  those  from  conventional  gasoline  fuels.  However,  sustainably produced  bio-methanol  is  the  lowest  of  results  calculated  [3].  Combustion  of  methanol  produces fewer  toxic  by-products-about  half  as  much  carbon  monoxide  and  an  eighth  as  much  nitrogen oxides (NOx)-compared with gasoline [16]. In terms of point-of-use emissions for transportation fuels,  methanol  generates  lower  carbon  dioxide  emissions  per  unit  energy  than  conventional petrochemical fuels [17]. It is possible to blend methanol with petrol to increase the octane value and reduce  the  cost,  without  the  need  for  any  engine  modifications  [18],  however  at  high  levels  it  is corrosive requiring specific compatible engines. In an interdisciplinary report prepared by MIT [19] on the future role of natural gas as an energy source, conversion to methanol is",
  "identified as having the lowest cost and GHG emissions in comparison with alternative liquid fuel products as well as being the only potential transformation that has been produced for a long period at an industrial scale. 2.4. Conversion of methane to methanol In theory, conversion of methane gas to liquid products offers many advantages, however the current  reality  is  that  processes  are  energetically  inefficient  and  costly.  The  highly  inert  nature  of saturated hydrocarbons makes chemical transformation challenging, and although high temperatures and pressures can be employed to promote reaction, this often results in loss of selectivity and low yields.  As  the  dissociation  energy  of  the  C-H  bond  in  methane  (440  kJ  mol -1 )  is  greater  than methanol (393 kJ mol -1 ),  under  oxidising  conditions, the  product  methanol  reacts preferentially  to methane forming a mixture of products including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, formaldehyde, and formic acid",
  "[20]. Current commercial methanol production overcomes selectivity issues by utilising  a two-step process in which fossil methane is first converted to syngas via steam reforming, followed by the metal-catalysed methanol synthesis step in an overall endothermic process (ΔH° = +116 kJ mol -1 ) (Figure 2). Initial  conversion  of  methane  and  water  to  carbon  monoxide  and  hydrogen  is  an  energy  intensive process,  operating  at  temperatures  around  900  ° C  and  pressures  of  3  MPa  [4].  Harsh  reaction conditions necessitate costly equipment that account for approximately 60% of the process capital costs [21,22]. In addition, the overall process has a conversion rate of ~25% and selectivity ~70% [21]. Interest  in  a  direct,  single  step  oxidation  of  methane  to  methanol  is  vast,  driven  by  many potential advantages over the conventional two-step process. In contrast to the indirect commercial process, the single step oxidation of methane to methanol is an",
  "exothermic reaction (ΔH° = -128 kJ mol -1 ) (Figure 3), avoiding the energy intensive, inefficient and expensive AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 7 CH, + ½ O2 CH, + H,0 CO + 2H2 CO + 3H2 CO+3 H2 CH.OH Д,H° = + 206 kJ mol-l AH° = - 128 kJ mol-' A,H° = - 90 kJ mol-' (1) (3) (2) syngas formation step. Mild reaction conditions also negate the need for specialist, costly equipment. Despite significant interest and effort in the direct partial oxidation of methane to methanol, many difficulties  remain  unsolved  and  as  such  the  selective  C-H  bond  activation  required  often  is described as the 'Holy Grail' of Chemistry [23]. Figure 2. Energies of indirect methanol formation from methane via syngas [24]. Figure 3. Energies of direct methanol formation from methane [24]. In summary, methane is a major contributor to the climate change problem that could instead be exploited  as  a  chemical  industry  feedstock  and  as  a  fuel.  Conversion  to  methanol  is  an",
  "attractive proposition  but  existing  processes  are  difficult  to  apply  to  less  accessible  methane  sources. Essentially this is due to difficult chemistry that biology has already evolved mechanisms to exploit. Due to it being an efficient energy store, convenient fuel suitable for use in the existing transport fuel infrastructure and raw-material for synthetic hydrocarbons, arguments exist for the implementation of a 'methanol economy' as an alternative to the current fossil-fuel based situation [25]. 3. Methanotrophic bacteria In  nature,  methanotrophic  bacteria  are  able  to  perform  the  controlled  partial  oxidation  of methane to methanol at high conversion and selectivity, allowing the use of methane as a sole carbon and  energy  source. This unique  ability makes  methanotrophs  a  valuable  candidate  for the bioconversion  of  methane  to  methanol.  Driven  by  the  prospect  of  commercial  exploitation  for biocatalysis and bioremediation, interest in these",
  "microorganisms has increased over the last 30 years [5]. 3.1. Methanotrophs: a brief introduction The first methanotroph was isolated by Sö hngen in 1906 which he named Bacillus methanicus [26] . Since then the most significant contribution was made by Whittenbury and his colleagues in 1970, in which over 100 methane-utilising bacteria were isolated, characterised and compared [27]. Playing an important role in the global methane cycle, methane-oxidising bacteria are found across a broad range of natural environments, present in nearly all samples taken from soil, swamps, rivers, oceans, AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 8 CH, - CH,OH ponds and sewage sludge, reportedly representing up to 8%  of the total 'heterotrophic' population [28]. As the majority of methane is naturally produced through the anaerobic decay of organic  matter,  they  are  found  primarily  at  oxic-anoxic  interfaces.  The  majority  of  known methanotrophs are aerobic, however, methane oxidation is",
  "known to occur in anaerobic environments by coupling oxidation to sulphate [29] and nitrite reduction  [30].  As expected from their prevalence within the environment, methanotrophs are found in both mesophilic and extreme environments.  Strains  have  been  isolated  from  temperatures  as  low  as  4  ° C  [31]  and  as  high  as 72  ° C  [32]  and  it  has  been  demonstrated  that  populations  of  methanotrophs  in  nature  adapt  to different temperatures [5]. Two populations of methanotrophs have been identified that exist depending on environmental methane  availability [33]. Low  affinity  methanotrophs  are able to utilise methane  at high concentrations (>40 ppm), and are observed in soils with high methane exposure, accounting for all isolated  methanotroph  cultures  known  to  date.  High  affinity  methanotrophs  are  able  to  oxidise ambient methane concentrations (~ 2 ppm) and although their existence within soil samples has been verified using molecular techniques,",
  "isolation of such bacteria has not yet been possible. Analysis of nucleic acids (DNA  and  RNA),  phospholipids,  methane  oxidation  rates  and  stable isotope probing (SIP) using 13 C labelled methane has provided characterisation information, and confirmed relatively  low  abundance  of  these  high  affinity  methanotrophs  in  soils  [34].  In  contrast  to  the relatively high abundance of methanotroph populations present in the environment, these low affinity methanotrophs account for <0.01% of total bacteria biomass in soils, attributed to low atmospheric methane concentrations [34]. Methane  monooxygenase  (MMO)  enzymes  catalyse  the  initial  oxidation  of  methane  to methanol,  followed  by  sequential  oxidation  to  formaldehyde  by  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH), oxidation of formaldehyde to formate by formaldehyde dehydrogenase (FADH), and finally formate to carbon dioxide by formate dehydrogenase (FDH). Formaldehyde is assimilated into biomass by either the ribulose",
  "monophosphate (RuMP) pathway, or the serine pathway. Figure 4 illustrates the metabolism of methane by methanotrophs. Figure  4. Pathways for the oxidation of  methane and assimilation of formaldehyde in methanotrophic bacteria [5,35]. Cytral 0, pMMO H,O CyCox RuMP Serine pathway pathway AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 9 Traditionally,  all  aerobic  methane-oxidising  bacteria  were  of  the  phylum Proteobacteria ,  and classified  into  two  major  groups:  Type  I  and  Type  II,  based  on  differences  in  physiological  and morphological traits, with Type X methanotrophs further differentiated from Type I [36,37]. Recent characterisation of several new genera and species, and the subsequent increase in the diversity of known methanotrophs, meant this system was no longer useful to characterise all known species, resulting in an update in the taxonomical description used to classify these organisms. Methanotroph  species  are  now  known  in Proteobacteria ,",
  "Verrucomicrobia and  candidate phylum NC10 . Proteobacteria methanotrophs are divided into two classes; Alphaproteobacteria and Gammaproteobacteria .  Current  classification  further  divides Gammaproteobacteria , of  the  order Methylococcales ,  into  three  families: Methylococcaceae ,  which  is  further  separated  into  Type  Ia, including a total of 13 genera, and Type Ib including four genera ( Methylococcus , Methylocaldum , Methylogaea and Methyloparacoccus ); Methylothermaceae ,  Type  Ic,  (genera: Methylothermus , Methylohalobius , Methylomarinovum ); and Crenotrichaceae which includes a single genus ( Crenothrix polyspora ) that to date has not been isolated as a pure culture. Methanotrophs of the family Methylococcaceae , of which the majority are Type Ia, utilise the RuMP cycle for carbon assimilation  and  have  intracytoplasmic  membranes  arranged  as  a  uniform  array  of  bundles  of vesicular  disks  distributed  evenly  across  the  cell.  Differing  from  Type",
  "Ia  methanotrophs  in  the expression  of  low  levels  of  the  ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate  carboxylase  enzyme,  in  addition  to  the RuMP pathway, genera formally identified as Type X were renamed Type Ib. The methanotrophic Alphaproteobacteria have  been  divided  into  two  families; Methylocystaceae ,  Type  IIa  (genera: Methylocystis, Methylosinus )  and Beijerinckiaceae ,  Type  IIb  (genera: Methylocella, Methylocapsa, Methyloferula )  methanotrophs.  Type  II  methanotrophs  of  the  family Methylocystacea ,  utilise  the serine  pathway  for  formaldehyde  assimilation,  with  the  intracytoplasmic  membrane  arranged  as stacks of vesicles in parallel to the cell membrane. Species of the family Beijerinckiaceae , identified as Type IIb, differ from Type IIa methanotrophs in that cells of Methylocella and Methylocapsa do not contain an intracytoplasmic membrane, while in Methyloferula they are found only on one side of  the  cell.  Extremophilic  methanotrophs  belonging",
  "to  the  phylum Verrucomicrobia ,  of  the  genus Methylacidiphilium are  sometimes  described  as  Type  III.  Able  to  grow  across  a  wide  range  of temperatures,  they  are  unique  in  comparison  with  all  other  known  methanotrophs  due  to  their extremely  acidophilic  phenotype  [38,39].  As  with  the  majority  of  methanotrophs  they  possess pMMO  but  lack  the  familiar  formaldehyde  assimilation  pathways,  instead  utilising  the  CalvinBenson  cycle  for  carbon  fixation  [40,41].  Anaerobic  methane  oxidation,  coupled  with  nitrite reduction, has been  observed  in bacteria of the candidate  phylum NC10 ,  and  named Ca. Methylomirabilis  oxyfera [30].  See  reviews  by  Knief  [42],  and  Semrau  [43]  for  comprehensive reviews of the current taxonomy of aerobic methanotrophs. Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (for 'oddball' strain 3b) [44] and Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath)  (originally  isolated  from  the  hot  water  baths  in  Bath,  UK)  [45],  have",
  "proven themselves  to  be  the  experimental  workhorses.  The  majority  of  investigation  into  the  effect  of environmental growth conditions, metabolic characterisation work, and consideration into commercial  applications  has  been  performed  using  these  two  strains  leading  to  for  full  genomic characterisation [44,46], further enhancing molecular and system level research in the species. AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 10 3.2. Biochemistry of methane oxidation using methane monooxygenase (MMO) Unique to methanotrophs is possession of MMO enzymes that catalyse the oxidation of methane to methanol. The initial reaction in the sequential oxidation to carbon dioxide, it is oxygen dependent and the most chemically difficult step. The monooxygenase splits the O-O bond of dioxygen using two reducing equivalents, with one of the oxygen atoms incorporated into methane to form methanol and the other reduced to water [47]. Two  types  of  MMO  have  been  found  in",
  "methanotrophic  bacteria;  a  soluble  cytoplasmic form  (sMMO)  and  a  particulate  membrane-bound  form  (pMMO).  All  methanotrophs,  with  the exception of members of the genera Methylocella [48] and Methyloferula [49],  have the ability to produce pMMO, however Type II methanotrophs are also able to produce sMMO. For those strains able  to  produce  both  forms,  the  environmental  growth  conditions are  responsible  for  dictating  the type of enzyme expressed within the cell, with dependence primarily on the availability of copper. Under  conditions  of  copper  excess  (>0.85  µ mol  g -1 dry  weight  of  cells)  pMMO  is  produced preferentially, while under conditions of limited copper availability, sMMO is generated, although the two are not mutually exclusive [50]. The dependence on copper availability is attributed to its presence in the active site of the pMMO enzyme [51]. The relative ease of isolation of sMMO has resulted in it being thoroughly studied and fully",
  "characterised [47,52]. sMMO  is  known  to be made up of three protein components: a hydroxylase (MMOH), a regulatory protein (MMOB), and a reductase (MMOR). The hydroxylase protein is made up of three polypeptide subunits, arranged as a α2β2γ2 dimer, and contains a di-iron active site where oxygen and methane react using electrons supplied from NADH oxidation at the reductase, facilitated by the regulatory protein [47]. In contrast, significantly less is known about the biocatalysis and structure of pMMO, despite it being more prevalent in nature, due to difficulties in isolation and stability of the membrane bound protein. pMMO is known to be comprised of three subunits: PmoA, PmoB and PmoC, arranged in a trimeric α3β3γ3 complex, with the di-copper active site on the soluble part of the PmoB subunit [53,54]. A number of recent reviews give full structural and mechanistic details of sMMO and pMMO [47,55-57]. Despite their similar function within the cell, sMMO and pMMO are not related",
  "structurally or genetically. Both  forms  of  MMO  are  able  to  co-oxidise  a  range  of  organic  substrates  in  the  presence  of methane  although  they  do  not  support in  vivo growth  [58,59].  sMMO  exhibits  broader  substrate specificity and is able to catalyse a larger number of biotransformations than pMMO. Preferential oxidation of smaller substrates by the pMMO system led to understanding that access to the active site of pMMO is sterically more restricted than sMMO [60]. The differences between the two forms of MMO have been predicted to lead to specific phenotypic differences. Cells that contain pMMO have  greater  growth  yields,  attributed  to  a  reduction  in  the  energetic  requirement,  and  exhibit  a higher affinity  for  methane  than those  containing  sMMO  [61,62].  This  is  related  to  differences  in reducing power utilisation between pMMO and sMMO. Electrons required for the initial oxidation step  are  provided  by  NADH  in  the  sMMO  catalysed",
  "reaction,  whereas  pMMO  utilises  reducing equivalents provided by the MDH co-factor pyrroloquinoline-quinone (PQQ) [61,62]. AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 11 3.3. Utilising methanotrophic bacteria as biocatalysts for the oxidation of methane to methanol The  majority  of  biological  methods  to  exploit  this  single  step  transformation  are  based  on utilising or mimicking powerful MMO enzymes that activate the C-H bond in methane in a highly selective process at ambient temperature and pressure. MMO-catalysed partial oxidation of methane to  methanol  has  a  number  advantages  over  thermochemical  oxidation  routes,  including  higher selectivity, improved process efficiency and safety, milder reaction conditions and energy savings, all leading to associated economic benefits. A  number  of  approaches  have  been  investigated  to  exploit  the  powerful  oxidising  ability  of methanotrophic  bacteria,  with  varying  potential  for  use  in  industrial",
  "processes.  Below  is  a  brief overview  of  these,  including  consideration  of  their  suitability  for  use  in  an  industrially  relevant process. As the method with greatest potential, exploiting whole cell methanotroph cultures will be the focus of this review. 3.3.1. Whole cell methanotroph cultures Whole  cell  methanotroph  cultures  have  the  potential  to  be  a  relatively  cheap  route  for  the bioconversion  of  methane  to  methanol.  The  generation  of  biomass  is  reasonably  simple  and  cost effective,  whilst  the  more  involved  molecular  operations,  such  as  the  synthesis  of  key  MMO enzymes and necessary reducing equivalents, are controlled entirely by the bacteria. Whole cells also have the capacity for self-maintenance and replication. Moreover, there are downstream processing benefits  because  although  the  biochemical  reactions  occur  within  the  intracellular  space,  the methanol accumulates extracellularly, which facilitates product",
  "isolation. Although currently the preferred option, whole cell biocatalysts do pose a number of challenges. Being closely specialised to a particular niche constrains their deployment in dissimilar biotechnological  process  operating  conditions.  High  cell  density  culture  also  has  proven  difficult, which has been attributed to gas-liquid transfer limitations [63,64]. The complex nature of cellular metabolism  in the case of methanotrophic  bacteria presents the risk of over oxidation to formaldehyde,  in  addition  to  complications  associated  with  interrupting  the  natural  biochemical pathways of the cell. An added level of process difficulty exists as it is necessary to design a biphasic growth  process  for  both  cell  growth  (enzyme  manufacturing  phase)  and  bioconversion  (methanol production phase). 3.3.2. MMO enzyme isolates Using methanotrophic bacteria for the desired transformation is ultimately a way to exploit the powerful MMO enzyme. Substantial research",
  "efforts mean MMO enzymes are fully characterised with a high level of understanding of their biochemistry. An alternative strategy uses enzyme isolates from cell cultures. By avoiding various complex cellular interactions, and therefore performing only the desired reaction, the particular benefit of the isolate strategy is that it avoids over oxidation of methanol  through  normal  cellular  metabolism.  The  bacteria  still  perform  the  difficult  MMO production and, in the absence of other cellular components, process interactions are simplified and AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 12 cellular  toxicity  is  not  an  issue.  Using  cell-free  preparations  of  the  MMO  enzyme  however  poses difficulties  in  isolation  and  purification  attributed  to  instability  of  the  purified  enzyme  [57]. Complications associated with working with an integral membrane bound protein hinder the use of pMMO, although cytoplasmic sMMO is more readily isolated. Typically",
  "stabilisation is achieved by enzyme immobilisation  on  or  in  artificial  matrices.  Even  so,  Evolution  did  not  optimise  Nature's catalysts  for  technical  process  conditions  and  so  stability,  activity  and  lifetime  become  process issues  [65].  Additionally,  cofactor  dependency  and  the  necessary  supply  of  exogenous  reducing equivalents favours the use of whole cells. The energy requirements for the system for both biomass production and bioconversion are equivalent to using a whole-cell culture, without the advantage of cell maintenance. 3.3.3. Genetically modified organisms It  is  possible  to  combine  the  advantages  of  whole-cell  systems  with  optimised  reaction processes. By using recombinant microorganisms containing artificial synthetic pathways, methanotrophs offer the potential for specific biotransformations (beyond just methane oxidation to methanol)  and  improved  product  yields.  Progress  here  is  currently  hindered  by  the  inability",
  "to express  functional  MMO  proteins  in Escherichia  coli [66-68].  Away  from  scientific  ability  and innovation,  the  production  and  use  of  GMOs  (genetically  modified  organisms)  poses  significant ethical consideration [69,70]. In the case of methanotrophs, Calysta have patented a process for the biological oxidation of hydrocarbons using a genetically engineered form of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, although a lack of published data to verify the system exists [71]. 3.3.4. Synthetic MMO analogues The  thorough  characterisation  and  understanding  of  the  biochemistry  of  MMO  enzymes suggests the design of synthetic 'biomimetic' catalysts with the potential to offer the advantages of using  enzyme  isolates  combined  with  the  stability  of  a  thermochemical  process.  Biologicallyinspired organometallic compounds might be designed so as to maximise selectivity, yield, reaction rate  and  conversion  efficiency,  whilst  increasing  tolerance  to  process",
  "conditions  compared  with purified enzymes, avoiding issues relating to instability of isolated membrane bound proteins, and being less susceptible to product inhibition [72]. However, taken together these objectives constitute a  challenging  optimisation  problem  that  likely  necessitates  a  similarly  complicated  molecular machine to MMO enzymes, which will challenge chemical synthesis. This must be contrasted with the  ease  and  efficiency  with  which  methanotrophs  produce  powerful  MMO  enzymes,  especially given  that  our  rapidly  increasing  ability  to  design  proteins  [73]  with  improved  properties  should overcome  many  of  the  limitations  of  MMO  enzymes.  Despite  efforts,  synthesis  of  a  chemically active MMO analogue has not yet been achieved [72]. AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 13 3.3.5. Ammonia-oxidising bacteria An alternative option utilises ammonia-oxidising bacteria containing the ammonia monooxygenase  (AMO)  enzyme,  a  pMMO",
  "homologue.  Similar  in  both  structure  and  function  to pMMO,  under  typical  cellular  conditions,  AMO  catalyses  the  oxidation  of  ammonia  (NH3)  to hydroxylamine  (NH2OH),  followed  by  the  hydroxylamine  oxidoreductase  catalysed  oxidation  to nitrate  (NO2 -).  The  metabolism  of  ammonia  generates  reducing  equivalents  for  the  cell,  whilst carbon  dioxide  is  used  as  a  carbon  source  [74].  Being  similar  in  structure  to  pMMO,  the  low substrate specificity of AMO also allows it to oxidise methane to methanol [75,76]. Despite  the  potential  of  ammonia  oxidising  bacteria,  a  number  of  challenges  exist  before commercial implementation will be possible, including slow reaction rates, high costs and technical immaturity. 4. Challenges and potential strategies associated with the methanotroph catalysed conversion of methane to methanol The  major  challenges  faced  in  developing  an  industrially  relevant  biological  partial  methane",
  "oxidation process are described below, in addition to approaches investigated to overcome these and optimise  reaction  conditions.  The  success  of  these  can  be  measured  in  terms  of  greater  biomass concentration, improved methanol yields and enhanced enzyme activity. 4.1. Challenge I: gas-liquid mass transfer limitations As in the majority of fermentation processes, biomass and cellular product generation will be limited  by  the  availability  of  metabolic  gases,  especially  at  high  cell  densities.  This  problem  is intensified by the sparingly soluble nature of gases such as oxygen and methane. It has been demonstrated that the low rates of gas-liquid mass transfer of methane in aqueous culture  is  a  growth  limiting  factor  [63,64]  which  is  responsible,  in  part,  for  slow  growth  and difficulty  in  high  biomass  production.  As  MMO  is  a  growth  associated  enzyme,  high  cell  density cultivation  can  result  in  an  increase  in  MMO  containing",
  "biomass  [77],  which  is  desirable  for  the proposed biotransformation. A number of process factors can be addressed to optimise the solubility of gaseous substrates in methanotroph  culture  including  reactor  design,  gas  delivery  method  and  temperature.  As  with  all gases,  the  solubility  of  methane  decreases  with  increasing  temperature  [78],  and  so  to  maximise dissolved methane and availability for the methanotroph culture, a low temperature is desired. This parameter is restricted, however, by the optimum temperature for culture growth and maintenance, as well as for MMO reaction and stability. The impact of temperature is further detailed in Section 4.6.2. 4.1.1. Optimised reactor design to maximise mass transfer Current  investigation  has  focused  on  employing  membrane  reactors  for  the  methanotroph catalysed  methane  oxidation.  The  delivery  of  gaseous  substrates  through  two  porous  membranes AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 14",
  "allows  the  separate  feed  of  methane  and  air  to  the  reactor,  reducing  risks  involved  in  using potentially explosive mixtures of gases (methane in air is explosive between 5% v/v and 15% v/v). The gases are delivered to the methanotroph culture through membrane contactors that offer a large surface area and avoid bubble formation, both of which optimise gas-liquid mass transfer. Duan et al. first demonstrated methane bioconversion in a dense silicon tube stirred membrane reactor. Through improved methane delivery to the liquid phase, methanotroph culture was possible at high cell densities up to 17.3 dry cell g/L, producing 0.95 g/L methanol after 40 h [79]. Pen et al. since  designed  and  demonstrated  methanotroph  biocatalysis  in  a  novel  recirculating  macroporous membrane bioreactor (MBR). The mass transfer achieved was twice that observed in a batch reactor in  similar  conditions,  producing  120  mg/L  methanol  after  24  h  [80].  Calysta's  commercial",
  "FeedKind® protein process is performed in a patented loop reactor optimised for gas-liquid mass transfer.  Rapid  liquid  flow  is  used  to  drive  substrate  gases  downwards  against  gravity,  faster  than they rise, leading to in situ pressurisation of the gases and consequently increased gas dissolution [81]. 4.1.2. Paraffin oil as a 'Methane Vector' In a novel approach to increase the mass transfer of methane from the gas phase to the liquid medium, Han et al. found that adding water-immiscible organic compounds in which methane has a higher  solubility,  showed  significant  improvement  on  cell  density.  With  the  addition  of  5%  (v/v) paraffin oil in the NMS medium, cell density of M. trichosporium OB3b reached 14 g/L (dry weight), around seven times higher than the control after 240 hours culture [63]. Higher concentrations of paraffin did not improve cell growth, suggesting that methane transfer is not the only limiting factor, and also attributed to the fact that cell",
  "growth was observed in the oil phase which could act as a barrier to metal ions and nutrient substrates. Although paraffin in the liquid medium has been shown to enhance methanotroph growth, the effect on methanol synthesis has not been investigated. 4.2. Challenge II: over oxidation of methane beyond methanol As part of the natural biochemical pathway in methanotrophs, methanol is further metabolised through formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide, so it is necessary to stop the reaction at the methanol oxidation level. One approach to enhance the production of methanol is to suppress over oxidation by inhibition of the MDH enzyme as shown in Figure 5. A number of compounds have been identified as MDH inhibitors with varying degrees of success in enhancing methanol production as some have been observed to also reduce MMO activity. The efficiency of methanol conversion is known to be impacted by the nature and concentration of such inhibitors. AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1,",

Cyclopropane-derived inhibitors Cyclopropane-derived compounds  have  been  found  to act as irreversible inhibitors of MDH  [82].  The  ring  opening  reaction  of  the  cyclopropane  functionality  with  pyrroloquinoline quinone (PQQ), the coenzyme of MDH, results in deactivation of the MDH [82,83]. Treatment of cell suspensions of M. trichosporium OB3b with cyclopropanol show extracellular methanol accumulation under a methane atmosphere [83-85]. At a cyclopropanol concentration of 6.18 µ M, MDH activity in M. trichosporium OB3b has been shown to decrease by 79%, although at this  level,",
  "simultaneous  reduction  in  pMMO  activity  of  12%  was  observed  [85].  After  100  hours, M. trichosporium OB3b produced 152 mmol/g (dry cell) methanol which is 51 times higher than produced under 'conventional conditions' although direct comparisons of this data is not possible due  to  the  lack  of  a  control,  and  the  distinct  differences  between  'conventional'  and  'optimum' conditions employed, including temperature and cell density. 4.2.2. High salt concentrations A range of inorganic compounds have been investigated offering MDH inhibition with varying effects on MMO activity. These are considered advantageous over inhibitors such as cyclopropanol as  they  are  cheaper,  more  chemically  stable  and  exhibit  reversible  nature.  It  is  believed  that electrostatic  interactions  between  MDH  and  cytochrome c L,  the  primary  electron  acceptor,  can  be disrupted by high salt concentrations in the culture medium, thus deactivating the enzyme [86,87].",
  "Initially observed in Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b cell-free extracts [88], and Methanomonas  methanooxidans microbial  culture  [89],  the  addition  of  phosphate  resulted  in methanol  accumulation  attributed  to  MDH  inhibition.  Complete  inhibition  of  MDH  has  been observed  in  cell-free  extracts  of M.  trichosporium at  150  mM  phosphate  [88],  with  120  mM pMMO NAD* CH,OH AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 16 phosphate concentration offering maximum inhibition in whole-cell suspensions of M. trichosporium [90]. At a concentration of 80 mM phosphate ions, 80% of the MDH activity was inhibited,  however  this  was  found  to  simultaneously  reduce  MMO  activity  by  16%,  and  FDH  by 20%  [90]. Extracellular accumulation of methanol  has been maximised  using  a phosphate concentration  of  400  mM,  generating  0.96  g/L  methanol  using  a  relatively  high  cell  density  of 17.3  g  dry  cell  L -1 ,  after  43  hours  [79].  Using  a  mixed",
  "microbial  culture,  Han  et  al.  observed maximum methanol production, and highest methane-to-methanol conversion ratio, at a phosphate concentration  of  40  mM  [91].  Inhibition  with  phosphate  was  found  to  be  fully  reversible,  with enzyme  activity  completely  restored  after  washing  of  the  cells  with  low  concentration  phosphate buffer [90]. The inhibition mode of phosphate on MDH was found to be uncompetitive, suggesting phosphate binds to a site on the enzyme or enzyme-substrate complex other than the active site [90]. A sodium chloride concentration of 300 mM has been shown to inhibit 100% of MHD activity in M.  trichosporium OB3b,  while  also  reducing  pMMO  activity  by  50%  [92].  Under  an  optimal concentration of 200 mM sodium chloride, 7 mM methanol accumulated after 36 hours, compared with  no  methanol  accumulation  under  the  same  conditions  in  an  absence  of  salt  [92].  In  a methanotroph based consortia, maximum methanol accumulation of",
  "0.5 mmol was observed with an optimum 100 mM sodium chloride concentration, in addition to a conversion ratio of almost 80% [91]. Electron microscopy has shown that at concentrations above 100 mM, sodium chloride disrupts cell  structure  and,  significantly,  the  intracytoplasmic  membrane  where  pMMO  is  found  [93]. Ethylenediaminetetraacetic  acid  (EDTA)  also  inhibits  MDH  activity,  through  chelation  of  metals present  in  the  enzyme,  and  is  not  known  to  impact  cell  morphology  [87].  Kim  et  al.  used  a combination of sodium chloride and EDTA, thus allowing reduced sodium chloride concentrations but maintaining MDH inhibition. The study demonstrated that the combination of 1 mM EDTA and 100  mM sodium chloride  was  optimal  for  methanol  production  [93].  At  higher  concentrations  of EDTA, methanol production was reduced, attributed to inhibition of MMO. The efficiency of lone EDTA  as  an  MHD  inhibitor  was  much  lower  compared  with  other",
  "inhibitors.  An  optimal concentration of 50 µ M in a mixed methanotroph consortia produced methanol at a conversion rate of just 43% [91]. Ammonium  chloride  is  also  known  as  an  MDH  inhibitor,  inducing  maximum  methane-tomethanol conversion of 80%, and optimal methanol accumulation at a concentration of 40 mM in a mixed microbial culture [91]. 4.2.3. Carbon dioxide Xin et al. investigated the effect of various concentrations of carbon dioxide on the production of  methanol  using M.  trichosporium IMV  3011  [35,94].  They  demonstrated  that  the  addition  of carbon  dioxide  to  methanotroph  cultures  under  a  methane/oxygen  atmosphere  resulted  in  the extracellular  accumulation  of  methanol.  It  was  found  that  40%  v/v  carbon  dioxide  resulted  in  an optimum accumulation of 14 µ mol/L methanol in a sealed flask after 24 h compared with a control where  no  methanol  was  detected  [35].  At  concentrations  above  40%  v/v  methanol  synthesis  was lower,",
  "attributed  to  greater  inhibition  of  methanol  oxidation  causing  NADH  limitation  within  the cells.  Using  an  appropriate  carbon  dioxide  concentration  in  the  gas  feedstock  is  believed  to  offer AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 17 partial inactivation of MDH, allowing simultaneous accumulation of methanol and NADH recycling through  complete  oxidation  of  methane  to  carbon  dioxide.  Although  reducing  the  maximum theoretical  efficiency  to  50%,  the  advantage  of  this  method  is  that  an  external  source  of  reducing equivalents is not needed and instead the natural NADH regenerating cycle can be exploited. 4.3. Challenge III: product inhibition As with ethanol fermentation, the oxidation of methane to methanol by methanotrophic bacteria is hindered by product inhibition [35,83]. Methanol was first shown to be toxic to most methanotroph strains  at  concentrations  as  low  as  0.01%  v/v  [27],  supported  by  the  work  of  Adegbola",
  "where methanol was found to completely inhibit growth at 40 g/L [95]. It has since been demonstrated that the  pMMO  enzyme  in M.  trichosporium OB3b  is  directly  inhibited  at  levels  as  low  as  10  mM methanol, confirmed by the complete inhibition of propene epoxidation [83]. It has been hypothesised that under stress conditions, methanotrophs may excrete various other products in addition to methanol, that could have negative effects on the bacterial oxidation ability. An inability to identify unknown compounds by GC-MS and the ultimate loss of oxidation ability after successive media renewals, suggest this is not the mechanism by which biocatalyst activity is lost [96]. 4.3.1. In situ product removal (ISPR) One method to overcome this issue is immediate removal of the methanol product using in situ product removal (ISPR). Maintaining the methanol concentration below inhibitory levels encourages methane  oxidation,  while  also  maximising  product  recovery  by  preventing",
  "over  oxidation.  ISPR necessitates  consideration  of  reactor  design  and  operation  but  has  the  added  benefit  of  reducing downstream processing and associated costs [97]. A  number  of  published  examples  of  continuous  and  semi-continuous  methanol  biosynthesis utilise  membrane  reactors  in  which  methanol  is  removed  in  the  reaction  media  as  a  means  to maximise product yield. In a semi-continuous process utilising an ultrafiltration cell, a suspension of M. trichosporium OB3b was investigated for methanol production. After incubation for 90 minutes the  reaction  mixture  was  filtered,  separating  product  methanol  from  the  cell  suspension.  This procedure was repeated five times producing a total of 36.1 µ mol methanol compared to 19.6 µ mol after 6 h in a batch reactor under the same conditions [83]. Xin et al. utilised a membrane reactor with a reaction volume of 40 mL and a continuous buffer feed to remove produced methanol from the  cell",
  "suspension.  The  reactor  was  run  for  198  h  without  loss  of  productivity  and  generated  a total ~23 µ mol methanol at a rate of 0.13 µ mol/h [35] . This was in comparison with a batch reaction under the same conditions in which a calculated total ~3.7 µ mol (18.8 µ mol/L quoted) methanol was produced,  as  a  consequence  of  product  inhibition.  Continued  productivity  can  be  attributed  to methanol removal, in addition to allowing a portion of the methanol produced to oxidise to carbon dioxide, generating NADH and maintaining MMO activity. Pen  et  al.  performed  successive  reaction  medium  renewals  over  a  22  h  methanol  production process, demonstrating increased methane oxidation activity compared to a process without media AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 18 renewal. A plateau in methanol concentration was observed at 22 h for both the reaction with and without media change, and the total methanol quantity produced was also comparable: 16.5 mg",
  "for the  consistent  reaction  media  and  18.0  mg  after  3  medium  renewals.  The  apparent  lack  of improvement on methanol production was attributed to a limit to bacterial oxidation capacity [96]. 4.4. Challenge IV: maintaining catalytic activity and methanotroph viability One issue in using whole cell cultures for catalysis is the need to maintain the physiological activity, catalytic activity and viability of the microbes. During the MMO catalysed oxidation of methane, two electrons are used to split the O-O bond in molecular oxygen, supplied by the cell in the form of NADH or cytochrome c (CytC) depending on whether sMMO or pMMO are utilised. Under standard cell conditions, reducing equivalents are regenerated from NAD+ and CytCox during oxidation of methanol via formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide. However, interruption of metabolic pathways by MDH inhibition and extraction of methanol results in the sequential oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide not being",
  "possible, thus preventing regeneration of reducing equivalents. Eventually exhaustion of the energy source results in loss of MMO activity and cell viability (Figure 5). An important point in considering the suitability of an electron source for an industrial process, it that it is low cost and sustainable. 4.4.1. Formate addition The addition of external metabolic electron donors to the reaction media overcomes this issue, allowing  continued  production  of  methanol.  Formate  is  a  preferred  choice  as  a  downstream metabolite  of  the  process  of  interest,  employed  in  the  majority  of  studies  [79,80,83,85,92,93,96,98,99]. Formate added to the reaction mixture is oxidised by FDH in the cell, generating an electron and carbon dioxide. Mehta et al . [98] were first to demonstrate the restoration of methanol synthesis by formate  addition  through  regeneration  of  NADH2.  The  rate  of  methanol  synthesis  in  an  MDH inhibited methanotroph culture was observed to fall",
  "off after 6 h, attributed to depletion of reducing equivalents, and the addition of 40 mM sodium formate to the reaction mixture restored biocatalytic activity  to  the  previous  level.  Takeguchi  et  al.  reported  methanol  accumulation  in  MHD  inhibited M.  trichosporium OB3b  increased  with  increasing  sodium  formate  concentration  in  the  reaction media up to a maximum 14.3 mmol/L [85]. In a study to establish the optimal reaction conditions for methanol synthesis, varying sodium formate concentration was investigated [92]. In agreement with Takeguchi et al., methanol synthesis increased with sodium formate addition, although an optimum concentration of 20 mM formate was determined  above  which  there  was  no  increase  in  methanol  accumulation.  In  conflict  however, Duan  et  al. found  that under  the reaction  conditions  employed,  increased  sodium  formate concentrations between 10 and 80 mM resulted in almost equivalent maximum methanol production, and  the",
  "accumulation  rate  decreased  with  increasing  formate  concentration  [79].  This  lead  to  the suggestion that to maximise rate of methanol synthesis, formate should be added to the media at low concentrations throughout reaction. AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 19 The  effect  on  methanol  synthesis  of  supplementing  the  microbial  culture  with  formate throughout reaction was investigated by Pen et al.. In a culture where maximum methanol synthesis had been achieved, and oxidation activity dropped off, the addition of 20 mM sodium formate did not restart bacterial activity. This suggests that once lost, methane oxidation activity is irreversible. When formate was added whilst the bacteria were still active, an adverse effect was observed. The methanol production rate immediately dropped off compared with a culture without formate addition, and a lower total methanol concentration was achieved (50 mg/L compared with 120 mg/L) [96]. It  is  believed  that  sodium",
  "formate  can  be  used  by  the  cell  in  the  serine  pathway  for  carbon fixation.  This  process  would  compete  with  NADH  regeneration,  with  the  two  processes  in equilibrium,  and  could  explain  the  noted  trend  in  increased  methanol  production  with  formate addition [96]. 4.4.2. Use of cellular regeneration pathways An  alternative  method  to  ensure  the  sustained  activity  of  MMO  is  to  use  the  cells'  natural regeneration mechanism through the complete oxidation of methane to carbon dioxide [35,94]. By supplying methane to the cell and not extracting methanol, reducing equivalents are generated that can  be  utilised  during  the  MMO  catalysed  oxidation  of  methane.  Through  alternating  between methanol  production  and  regeneration  cycles,  semi  continuous  methanol  biosynthesis  can  be maintained. Although use of the methane feedstock in this way reduces the overall process yield, it is necessary to maintain the viability of the cell and",
  "provides a relatively cheap and simple solution. This principle has been demonstrated successfully by Xin et al. for the biosynthesis of methanol from  carbon  dioxide  with M.  trichosporium IMV  3011  [94,100].  The  hydrogenase  enzymes responsible for the oxidation of methanol to carbon dioxide, via formaldehyde and formate, are able to catalyse the reverse reactions, although progressing against the natural biochemical pathway is an energy intensive process requiring an electron for each sequential reduction. In batch experiments after continuous reaction for 48 hours, almost 100% of the methanol synthesis ability of the cells was lost,  however  by  alternate  reaction  for  24  hours  and  regeneration  for  12  hours  with  methane  and air (1:10, v/v) there was no notable loss in methanol synthesis after 9 cycles [94]. It was proposed, due to the rapid resumption of cellular viability and reduction ability, that regeneration of reducing equivalents was responsible rather than",
  "growth of additional cells that would be considerably slower. 4.4.3. Using poly-β-hydroxybutyrate cellular energy store In addition to NADH as a direct source of reducing equivalents, the ability of the cell to store energy in the form of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB) has been considered. PHB is a lipid, produced and accumulated as an intracellular carbon and energy storage molecule by a variety of microorganisms  in  response  to  stress  conditions,  and  undergoes  metabolism  releasing  reducing equivalents  when  standard  energy  sources  are  not  available  [100].  PHB  accumulation  has  been observed in methanotrophic bacteria [27,28,101], and is known to be synthesised by the RuMP and serine pathways in response to nitrogen, phosphate and oxygen limitation [100]. PHB production is believed  to  be  mainly  non-growth  associated,  with  maximum  accumulation  occurring  during  late AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 20 growth  and  early  stationary  phases  [102].",
  "The  main  factor  that  determines  the  extent  of  PHB production is availability of the synthetic precursor, acetyl-CoA. Type II methanotrophs employing the  serine  pathway  are  the  most  effective  producers  able  to  accumulate  up  to  80%  PHB  by  dry weight [103,104]. Thomson et al. noted the metabolism of PHB in the presence of C2 compounds, attributed in part  to  the  satisfaction  of  energy  requirements  in  utilising  non-growth  associated  substrates  [105]. Additionally,  the  capacity  for M.  trichosporium OB3B  to  degrade  trichloroethylene  (TCE)  in  an sMMO catalysed  reaction  was  enhanced  160%  in  cells  containing  10%  PHB  compared  with  2% PHB [106]. Similarly a positive correlation has been noted between PHB content and TCE oxidation ability  in  a  mixed  methanotroph  culture,  supported  by  the  observed  increase  oxidation  rate  on addition  of  the  PHB  monomer,  β-hydroxybutyrate  [107].  It  is  believed  that  the  finite  supply",
  "of reducing equivalents within the cell is supplemented by the metabolism of stored PHB. 4.4.4. Microbial electrosynthesis Microbial  electrosynthesis  is  the  process  by  which  electrons  can  be  transferred  from  an electrode  to  living  cells  to  provide  energy  for  biocatalytic  synthetic  processes.  A  relatively  new concept, the direct supply of electrons from an electrode to microbes was initially investigated by Gregory  et  al . for  the  anaerobic  respiration  of Geobacteraceae [108].  The  idea  has  been  further developed to utilise an applied current in an electrochemical cell to drive microbial metabolism for the production of a range of fuels and chemicals [109,110]. In a novel approach, it is proposed that microbial electrosynthesis could be used to supply reducing equivalents directly to the methanotroph culture in place of formate. To date only a small number of bacterial species have been found to accept electrons directly from an electrode, with no",
  "electrotrophic methanotrophs identified. Should such species be identified and isolated, and using renewably sourced electrical power, it may be possible to provide a cheap and sustainable source of electrons for methane oxidation. 4.4.5. Cell integrity It  has  been  demonstrated,  that  the  addition  of  high  concentrations  of  sodium  chloride  as  an MDH inhibitor has a negative impaction on cell integrity and methane oxidation ability by disrupting the  structure  of  intracytoplasmic  membranes  [93].  This  discovery  prompted  investigation  into alternative MDH inhibitors that do not negatively impact cell morphology. Pen et al. employed flow cytometry to investigate the integrity of the bacterial culture before and after a methanol production experiment. At the beginning of the experiment, 81% of cells were viable, with damaged cells constituting 5% of the bacterial population, which dropped to 41% viable and 38% dead after 48 h methanol production [96]. Loss in methane",
  "oxidation ability of the cells is believed to be related to loss in cell membrane integrity. Despite the presence of 41% viable cells, the oxidation activity loss was measured as 97%, which indicated that the loss of biocatalytic activity of the cells was due to both cell death and an alternative mechanism [96]. AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 21 Pen et al. noted that the proportion of viable cells halved and the bacterial concentration was reduced  by  23%  after  48  h  of  methanol  synthesis.  The  reduction  in  optical  density  (OD) measurements was attributed to cell lysis and absorption of bacteria onto the bioreactor [96]. Cell lysis would result in the release of MMO enzymes from the cell into the reaction media. However, the  low  stability  and  activity  of  MMO  isolates  suggest  the  catalytic  contribution  from  these  to  be minimal. The  effect  of  fresh  biocatalyst  addition  during  the  methane  oxidation  process  has  also  been investigated and",
  "is surprisingly shown to have a negative impact on methanol production. After 22 h, at the point of loss in methanol oxidation activity, addition of fresh methanotroph culture to double the total biocatalyst concentration, showed  a  sudden  and  strong decrease in the  methanol concentration, with 70% of the produced methanol lost after a further 24 h [96]. Biocatalyst addition at  a  stage  whilst  the  bacteria  were  still  viable  and  activity  high,  also  resulted  in  methanol consumption  by  the  bacteria,  even  in  the  presence  of  MDH  inhibitors.  The  explanation  for  this previously  unreported  phenomenon  is  that  the  accumulated  methanol  gives  rise  to  configuration changes on the PQQ group, restoring the ability for electron transfer from PQQ to cytochrome CL, ultimately overriding the sodium chloride MDH inhibition and restoring methanol oxidation [96]. 4.5. Challenge V: toxicity of source methane impurities The oxidation of methane by methanotrophs is",
  "well known to be sensitive to impurities in the methane  feedstock,  attributed to the low  substrate specificity of the  oxidation  enzymes  in methanotrophs  including  MMO,  MDH  and  FDH  [27]  (the  names  of  which  do  not  describe  the specificity for such substrates but their metabolic function within the cell). Non-growth hydrocarbons are  co-oxidised  by  the  bacteria,  producing  toxic  metabolites  that  have  the  potential  to  disrupt metabolic  pathways  through  both  competitive  inhibition  of  catalysts  and  accumulation  of  toxic products, which ultimately results in cell death [84,105]. Ethane is particularly problematic as it is generally the most abundant organic compound in natural gas after methane, and is oxidised through ethanol and acetaldehyde to acetate followed by build-up in the cells. Although free from higher hydrocarbons, methane biogas - the product of industrial anaerobic digestion-contains a mixture of gases depending on the feedstock",
  "composition. Primarily methane  (30%-70%)  and  carbon  dioxide  (25%-50%),  it  also  contains  trace  impurities  including hydrogen sulphide (<2000 ppm), ammonia  (<100 ppm) and organic chlorine and silicon compounds [111]. These impurities pose process difficulties if biogas sources of methane are utilised. The removal of impurities in the methane feedstock can be achieved by the implementation of gas  purification  processes.  Options  are  vast  depending  on  the  methane  source  and  problematic contaminants.  Generally  however  a  number  of  stages  are  required  resulting  in  a  complex,  energy intensive and expensive process [112]. 4.5.1. Microbial consortium Interestingly, methanotroph cultures are abundant in natural gas environments such as around petroleum seeps and vents where longer chain gaseous alkanes including ethane, propane and butane AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 22 are  present  at  inhibitory  concentrations  [113-115].  It  is  well",
  "known  that  natural  methanotrophic populations exist in symbiotic communities with a range of organisms, including a variety of alkane oxidising organisms able to utilise both C1 and ≥C2 substrates [116]. It is believed that within such situations methanotrophs are able to selectively utilise methane whilst potentially toxic ≥C2 alkanes are removed by other bacterial species. Of the methanotrophic strains identified, only those of the genus Methylocella are able to grow on substrates containing C-C bonds [48,117,118], in contrast to numerous bacteria that are capable of growth on linear alkanes C2-C9 but not methane [113]. Han et al. were the first to investigate methanol production using a mixed culture consortium from a natural environment [91]. Isolated from a land fill site, 16S rRNA gene analysis identified the key  species present as Methylosinus  sporium NCIMB  11126, M.  trichosporium OB3b  and M.  capsulatus (Bath).  Maximum  methanol  accumulation  was  demonstrated,  with",
  "sodium  chloride MDH inhibition, at a production rate of 9 µ mol/mg h. No change to microbial community structure was  observed  over  the  24  h  time  course  experiment,  suggesting  stability  of  the  methanotroph community and methane oxidation process. This  has  been  demonstrated  commercially  by  Norferm  AS  who  have  developed  an  industrial process utilising a synthetic bacterial community including M. capsulatus (Bath) to convert natural gas, to a bacterial biomass product known as BioProtein ® [116]. 4.6. Challenge VI: optimised biotechnological conditions and consideration of requirements of the biphasic process The  first  stage  in  the  biocatalytic  process  is  growth  of  biomass,  during  which  the  bacteria multiply  and  manufacture  the  critical  MMO  enzymes.  This  is  followed  by  the  bioconversion  of methane  to  methanol  which  can  be  considered  the  production  phase  and  the  specific  reaction  of interest.  Unsurprisingly  the  optimum",
  "conditions  for  these  two  processes  differ  which  presents  the option  for  using  a  single  vessel  with  compromised  conditions,  or  a  two-step  process  allowing conditions tailored to culture and reaction separately. 4.6.1. Copper concentration It is well documented that the concentration of copper in the reaction medium is responsible for the expression of sMMO and pMMO, and consequently the bacterial growth rate. For strains able to produce both MMO forms, under conditions of copper excess pMMO is made preferentially, while under conditions of limited copper availability sMMO is present [50]. Excess copper beyond that required to switch from sMMO to pMMO expression increases the activity of pMMO [119], and it has  been  demonstrated  that  cells  producing  pMMO  have  a  faster  growth  rate  and  higher  catalytic activity  with  methane  [120].  Cells  producing  pMMO  have  greater  growth  yields  than  those expressing sMMO attributed in part to the reduced energy",
  "requirements on the cell [61,62]. In  terms  of  methanol  synthesis,  it  is  proposed  that  the  copper  concentration  has  an  indirect effect  in  the  form  of  MMO  synthesised  and  the  relative  enzymatic  activity.  Markowska  & Michalkiewicz  showed  a  positive  correlation  between  copper  content  in  the  media  and  methanol synthesis by M. trichosporium OB3b up to 1.0 µ mol/L, above which productivity decreased [121]. AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 23 4.6.2. Temperature It  has  been  observed  that  the  optimum  temperature  is  different  for  MMO  activity  and  cell growth  in  methanotrophic  bacteria.  Mehta  et  al.  found  the  optimum  temperature  for  methanol accumulation in M. trichosporium OB3b to be 35 ° C [90], confirmed by Lee et al. who noted that maximum sMMO activity  is  observed  at  35  ° C  whereas  the  rate  of  cell  growth  is  maximised  at 37 ° C [122]. Above 40 ° C led to a decrease in methanol accumulation [90],",
  "attributed to instability in the  MMO  system.  Takeguchi  et  al.,  however,  observed  maximum  methanol  accumulation  in M.  trichosporium OB3b  by  pMMO  at  25  ° C  [85].  Increasing  temperature  resulted  in  reduced methanol accumulation attributed to instability of the pMMO enzyme at elevated temperatures. 4.6.3. pH The effect of pH on methanotroph growth rate and MMO activity is less sensitive compared to the  temperature  and  copper  concentration  effect.  In M.  trichosporium OB3b  the  optimal  pH  for sMMO  activity  was  shown  to  be  6.2-6.4  compared  with  pH  7.0  for  cell  growth  [122].  In M. trichosporium OB3b expressing pMMO optimal methanol synthesis was observed at pH 6.5 [90]. 4.6.4. Cell concentration The cell concentration in the reaction medium influences extracellular methanol accumulation as  MMO  is  a  growth  associated  enzyme.  Mehta  et  al.  found  maximum  methanol  production  in M.  trichosporium OB3b  at  a  cell  concentration  of  4",
  "mg  ml -1 [90],  in  close  agreement  with  the findings of Xin et al. at 3 mg/ml [35]. In contradiction Lee et al . noted an optimum cell concentration of 0.6 mg/ml for methanol synthesis [92]. It is believed that the maximum cell concentration able to be supported is limited by the availability of methane in the reaction mixture, related to gas-liquid mass transfer limitations and as such delivery methods and culture conditions. The methanol production kinetics, for reaction in a membrane bioreactor, exhibited  the same profile at biocatalytic concentrations between 11 u/ml and 150 u/ml, with little correlation between total methanol production and biocatalyst concentration [80]. This behaviour was shown to be related to oxygen limitation due to absorption of bacteria and fouling of bioreactor membranes. 4.6.5. Bacterial strain To  date Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  has  been  the  preferred  methanotroph  species  for investigation  into  the  potential  for  a  biocatalytic",
  "partial  methane  oxidation  process,  aided  by  the wealth  of  characterisation  data  available.  The  application  of  alternative  species,  in  particular extremophilic and extremotolerant methanotrophs, able to either thrive or tolerate living in extreme environments,  offers  huge  potential  in  terms  of  maximising  methanol  yield  through  process efficiencies. The use of psychrophilic methanotrophs, capable of growth at low temperatures, would be well suited  to  tackling  gas-liquid  mass  transfer  limitations.  The  solubility  of  methane  increases  with AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 24 decreasing  temperature,  however  this  is  currently  constrained  in  methanol  biosynthesis  by  the optimum  temperature  of M.  trichosporium OB3b  which  is  30  ° C.  A  number  of  psychrophilic methanotrophs  have  been  identified  and  isolated  from  a  range  of  low  temperature  ecosystems including Siberian tundra bogs, Antarctic lakes, and bottom",
  "sediments and water from Pacific and Atlantic Oceans [123]. The potential of such species in an industrial process is limited as the rates of in  vivo methane  oxidation  and in  vitro metabolic  activity  have  been  demonstrated  to  decrease significantly as the temperature is lowered from 30 ° C to 5 ° C [124]. MMO  isolated  from  thermophilic  methanotrophs  has  the  potential  to  be  better  suited  to industrial process conditions, offering increased stability under high temperature reaction conditions which  would  promote  increased  reaction  rates.  Tolerance  and  active  growth  of  such  species  in environments of elevated temperatures suggests development of metabolic systems to survive under these extreme conditions. Isolated and characterised by Bodrossy et al . , strain HB was isolated from Japanese  and  Hungarian  hot  springs,  capable  of  growth  at  temperatures  up  to  70  ° C  [32]. Representing a new genus, the name 'Methylothermus' was proposed, however",
  "this organism was not extensively characterised and is no longer extant. With investigation prompted by loss of the HB strain,  the  only  truly  thermophilic  methanotroph  currently  known  is  strain  MYHT,  described  as Methylothermus  thermalis . Isolated from  a Japanese hot spring,  and capable of growth  at temperatures 37-67 ° C (optimum 57-59 ° C), it is closely related to the HB strain [125]. The  biochemical  and  molecular  mechanisms  by  which  methanotrophs  are  able  to  survive  in such harsh conditions is still uncertain, although de novo synthesis of ectoine as a stress protectant is known  [123].  Further  understanding  of  responses  to  stress  conditions  is  needed,  in  addition  to bioenergetic and genetic aspects of extremophile adaptation. Advances have been made, and as such we  are  increasingly  able  to  isolate  and  culture  extremophilic  methanotrophs,  which  furthers  the potential for industrial biotechnological applications. MMO activity is",
  "not only dependent on the expression of either soluble or particulate forms, regulated by copper availability, but also the methanotroph species in question. An example of this is the  low  methanol  productivity  recorded  by  Xin  et  al.  attributed  to  low  specific  MMO  activity  of M. trichosporium 3011, which is about one percent compared with M. trichosporium OB3b [35]. It would therefore be reasonable to expect methanotroph species to exist with MMO activities greater than that in OB3b, which would offer the potential for higher methanol production rates. 4.6.6. Citric acid as a Krebs cycle substrate The effect of various organic chemicals on the growth of M. trichosporium OB3b was studied as a means to improve the cell density by Xing et al. [126]. The addition of vitamins, amino acids and organic acids involved in the Krebs cycle and serine pathway of Type II methanotrophs were anticipated  to  enhance  assimilation  of  formaldehyde  to  biomass.  Addition  of  citrate",
  "had  the  most pronounced  positive  effect,  at  an  optimal  concentration  of  0.015  mmol/L  the  cell  density  was 0.66 g/L (dry weight), more than 3.5 times that of the control, after 4 days cultivation [126]. It is believed the addition of such organic acids alters the metabolic flow of formaldehyde from oxidation to formate, and ultimately carbon dioxide, into the Krebs cycle for cell growth. Although the addition AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 25 of  citric  acid  was  shown  to  greatly  increase  the  cell  density  of  the  bacterial  culture,  the  effect  on methanol synthesis was not investigated. 5.

Conclusion methanol Potential strategies: - Reactor design - Addition of 'Methane vectors' - MDH inhibitors Methane is an abundant natural resource used in the generation of heat and electrical power. Most notably, methane is extracted from geological fossil deposits. A significant proportion of these are  identified  as  stranded  methane  deposits.  GTL technologies are being developed as a means to exploit these remote, often diffuse sources. An additional and often undervalued resource is methane produced during anaerobic digestion that results in large volumes released as a waste product from numerous industrial processes. Consequently atmospheric methane concentrations are at unprecedented levels that, as a potent greenhouse gas, are a major cause for concern. This has led to the instigation of various methane abatement schemes. GTL technologies offer the opportunity to convert",
  "methane into a liquid hydrocarbon fuel that is more  readily  handled  and  transported  than  the  gas  precursor.  Of  the  range  of  possible  products, methanol  is  considered  an  attractive  option  with  the  potential  for  a  'methanol  economy'  to  fulfil both  the  energy  and  hydrocarbon  feedstock  demands  currently  satisfied  by  fossil  fuels.  The commercial production of methanol from methane is an energy intensive two-step process. A direct, single-step oxidation would be an attractive option with the potential for energy and cost  savings.  Methanotrophic  bacteria  utilise  powerful  MMO  enzymes  to  perform  the  desired reaction with a high level of selectivity under mild conditions. It is proposed that the methanotroph catalysed oxidation of methane to methanol is a potential GTL technology. The advantages of such a process are the low energy and cost requirements; suitability for small scale, modular processes thus allowing use of diffuse and remote gas",
  "sources; and the contribution towards methane abatement. Figure  6  summarises  the  five  main  challenges  faced  in  developing  an  industrially  relevant biocatalytic methane oxidation process, and the potential strategies to overcome these. Figure 6. Current challenges and potential strategies for the methanotroph biocatalysed conversion of methane to methanol. Relatively slow growth and the inability to obtain high cell density cultures is attributed to low methane solubility being a growth limiting factor. This can be addressed through process and reactor 2 3 4 5 AIMS Bioengineering Volume 5, Issue 1, 1-38. 31 design to allow optimised gas-liquid mass transfer. In terms of methanol synthesis, the first problem arises as methanol is not the final product in the oxidation of methane, but a precursor used by the cell to generate electrons and synthesise various essential metabolites. For this reason, it is necessary to inhibit the MDH enzyme, which results in the accumulation of",
  "methanol but also causes depletion of cellular reducing equivalents. It is possible to provide exogenous electrons to the biocatalyst from a number of sources, although partial suppression of MDH, rather than complete inhibition, allows a portion  of  methanol  to  be  fully  oxidised  and  so  exploits  the  cell's  natural  regeneration  pathways. Additionally,  methanol  is  toxic  to  most  methanotroph  strains  and  so  must  be  removed  from  the reaction medium before growth and methanol synthesis is affected. Implementation of ISPR methods in the initial  process  design  avoids  biocatalyst  poisoning  whilst  also  maximising  methanol production yields. Although the low specificity of the MMO enzymes is one of the factors that give methanotrophs such potential for applications in biotechnological processes, it presents a complication in biocatalysis of methane. The co-oxidation of contaminants in the feedstock methane gas  are  further  metabolised  generating  toxic  by-",
  "products  that  accumulate  within  the  cell,  causing death and loss of biocatalytic activity. It is proposed that use of either natural or synthetic microbial consortia  will  overcome  this,  mimicking  natural  conditions  where  methanotrophs  are  able  to selectively utilise methane whilst potentially toxic compounds are removed by other bacterial species that utilise higher hydrocarbons. As new strains of methanotrophs are constantly being discovered, isolated  and  characterised,  this  also  offers  potential  to  identify  extremophilic  species  that  may address some of the identified challenges. It is believed that continued progress in these areas will ultimately  allow  the  development  of  a  technically  feasible  and  economically  viable  methanotroph bioconversion of methane to methanol.
