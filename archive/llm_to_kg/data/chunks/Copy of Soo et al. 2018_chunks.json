  "CHAPTER TWELVE Recent Advances in the Genetic Manipulation of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b Soo Y. Ro, Amy C. Rosenzweig 1 Northwestern University, Evanston, IL, United States 1 Corresponding author: e-mail address: amyr @ northwestern.edu Contents Abstract Methanotrophic bacteria utilize methane as their sole carbon and energy source. Studies of the model Type II methanotroph Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b have provided insight into multiple aspects of methanotrophy, including methane assimilation, copper accumulation, and metal-dependent gene expression. Development of genetic tools for chromosomal editing was crucial for advancing these studies. Recent interest in methanotroph metabolic engineering has led to new protocols for genetic manipulation of methanotrophs that are effective and simple to use. We have incorporated these newer molecular tools into existing protocols for Ms. trichosporium OB3b. The modifications include additional shuttle and replicative plasmids as well as",
  "improved gene delivery and genotyping. The methods described here render gene editing in Ms. trichosporium OB3b efficient and accessible.

INTRODUCTION Methanotrophic bacteria are unique in their ability to utilize methane, a potent greenhouse gas, as their sole carbon source (Hanson & Hanson, 1996). In the first step of their metabolic pathway, methane is oxidized to methanol, which can be utilized as a cheap carbon feedstock for industrial chemical processes (Lawton & Rosenzweig, 2016). For this reason, there have been extensive efforts to understand methanotrophy in multiple species of bacteria. Most aerobic methanotrophs are classified as Type I (Gammaproteobacteria) or Type II (Alphaproteobacteria) based on their use of either the ribulose monophosphate or serine cycles for carbon assimilation,",
  "respectively, as well as their phospholipid compositions, cell morphologies, and membrane arrangements (Hanson & Hanson, 1996; Semrau, DiSpirito, & Yoon, 2010). Methane is oxidized to methanol by methane monooxygenase enzymes (MMOs), followed by methanol conversion to formaldeyhde by methanol dehydrogenases (MDHs). There are two types of MMO, a soluble and cytoplasmic iron-containing enzyme (sMMO) and a 'particulate' and inner membrane-bound copper-containing enzyme (pMMO) (Ross & Rosenzweig, 2016). With the exception of the genera Methylocella and Methyloferula , aerobic methanotrophs express pMMO under most conditions (Semrau et al., 2010; Vorobev et al., 2011). Under copperstarved conditions, some Type I and Type II methanotrophs can switch to sMMOexpression(Semrauetal., 2010), and some Methylosinus and Methylocystis species also produce the copper chelator methanobactin (Dassama, Kenney, & Rosenzweig, 2017). Methylosinus trichosporium OB3bis the best studied Type II methanotroph",
  "(Stein et al., 2010). This bacterium can express both sMMO and pMMO, produces methanobactin (Dassama et al., 2017), and can express two distinct MDHs, the calcium-binding MxaF and the lanthanide-binding XoxF (Haque, Kalidass, et al., 2015). Genetic tools developed previously for Ms. trichosporium OB3b have been used to mutate or disrupt the genes encoding several important proteins. Recent studies have focused on sMMO (Borodina, Nichol, Dumont, Smith, & Murrell, 2007; Lock, Nichol, Murrell, & Smith, 2017; Semrau et al., 2013; Smith & Murrell, 2011; Smith, Slade, Burton, Murrell, & Dalton, 2002), proteins in the extended pmo operon (Gu, Haque, & Semrau, 2017), methanobactin transport and biosynthetic proteins (Dassama, Kenney, Ro, Zielazinski, & Rosenzweig, 2016; Gu, Genetic Manipulation of Ms. trichosporium OB3b 337 Baral, DiSpirito, & Semrau, 2017; Gu et al., 2016; Gu, Haque, et al., 2017), and genes related to MDH (Haque, Gu, DiSpirito, & Semrau, 2015). In recent years, new genetic",
  "manipulation tools have been developed for two Type I haloalkaliphilic methanotrophs, Methylomicrobium alcaliphilum 20Z (Kalyuzhnaya et al., 2008; Ojala, Beck, & Kalyuzhnaya, 2011) and Methylomicrobium buryatense 5G (Puri et al., 2015; Yan, Chu, Puri, Fu, & Lidstrom, 2016). These protocols have been used to engineer methanotrophs for biofuel production (de la Torre et al., 2015; Henard et al., 2016; Kalyuzhnaya, Puri, & Lidstrom, 2015) and have also enabled studies of lanthanide-dependent methanol oxidation (Chu & Lidstrom, 2016), ectoine biosynthesis (Mustakhimov et al., 2009), and fatty acid biosynthesis (Demidenko, Akberdin, Allemann, Allen, & Kalyuzhnaya, 2017). This chapter describes the incorporation of these newer techniques developed for Type I methanotrophs into the traditional mutagenesis protocol for Ms. trichosporium OB3b (Murrell, 1994; Lloyd, Finch, Dalton, & Murrell, 1999; Smith & Murrell, 2011). By simplifying cloning, gene delivery via conjugation or electroporation,",
  "and DNA isolation for genotyping, this hybrid method will facilitate future investigations and engineering of Ms. trichosporium OB3b. 2. MS. TRICHOSPORIUM OB3B GROWTH CONDITIONS Ms. trichosporium OB3b strains are grown in nitrate minimal salt (NMS) media (Hakemian et al., 2008) (Table 1). Cultures are grown under either low copper (0.1 μ M CuSO4) or high copper (10 -25 μ M CuSO4) conditions in liquid cultures and agar plates. Many genes of interest in methanotrophs are copper regulated, and it may be necessary to alter the copper concentration to ensure viability and to avoid selection against the genetic modifications. Similar considerations may be appropriate for genes regulated by other environmental factors. Initially, cells at an OD 600 of 0.1 are inoculated into 50mL cultures in 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks sealed with rubber septa. The flasks are then incubated at 30 ° C with shaking at 200rpm, and oxygen and methane levels are maintained via daily sparging with a 1:3 methane-to-air",
  "ratio at 1L/min for 5min. An OD600 of /C24 1.5 is typically reached after 1 week of growth. Agar plates are incubated in GasPak plate incubation chambers (BD) at 30 ° C, and gas exchange is facilitated by use of a vacuum to create negative pressure inside the chamber followed by gas flow at a 1:1 methane-to-air ratio at 338 Soo Y. Ro and Amy C. Rosenzweig Table 1 Ms. trichosporium OB3b Growth Conditions ZnSO4 /C1 7H2O, 0.288; MnCl2 /C1 4H2O, 0.16; H3BO3, 0.06; Na2MoO4 /C1 2H2O, 0.048; CoCl2 /C1 6H2O, 0.048; KI, 0.083 1L/min for 3min. Colonies on plates typically appear in 1 -2 weeks. Antibiotics such as kanamycin (25 μ g/mL) and gentamicin (5 μ g/mL) are used to select for mutants, and naladixic acid (10 μ g/mL) is used to remove donor Escherichia coli strains as described later. The bacterial strains used in this protocol are listed in Table 2. Genetic Manipulation of Ms. trichosporium OB3b 339 p15a oriT KanR pk18mobsacB_p15a trfA- tral oril oriV pAWP89_p15a 3. PLASMIDS FOR",
  "MUTAGENESIS For chromosomal site-directed mutagenesis or gene deletion, a broad host range vector pk18 mobsacB (Sch € afer et al., 1994) has been used in several methanotrophs, including Ms. trichosporium OB3b (Borodina et al., 2007). However, it is sometimes difficult to insert methanotroph genes, including those in the pmo operon, into this plasmid due to leaky expression at high copy number and subsequent toxicity of the product proteins in E. coli (Ojala et al., 2011). We have employed the following two strategies to circumvent this issue. First, we use the chemically competent E. coli strain CopyCutter EPI400 (Lucigen), designed to control plasmid copy number, to increase the success rate for cloning of methanotroph genes. However, the plasmid must then be incorporated into the E. coli donor strain S17-1 (Simon, Priefer, & P € uhler, 1983) for subsequent conjugation. Transformation into S17-1 can also fail due to leaky expression. As a second, alternative strategy, we have",
  "constructed a modified version of pk18 mobsacB under p15a copy control (Selzer, Som, Itoh, & Tomizawa, 1983) to generate the plasmid pk18 mobsacB _p15a (Fig. 1; Table 3). This shuttle vector has improved the efficiency of cloning methanotroph genes, such as those in the pmo operon (Ojala et al., 2011). Replicative plasmids are useful tools for protein overexpression or probing promoters. We tested a replicative plasmid compatible with Type I methanotrophs for function in Ms. trichosporium OB3b. The Lidstrom laboratory has constructed a replicative plasmid pAWP89 that can be maintained in M. buryatense 5G (Puri et al., 2015). We have determined that Fig. 1 Plasmid maps of pk18 mobsacB _p15a and pAWP89_p15a. -p15a 340 Soo Y. Ro and Amy C. Rosenzweig Fig. 2 Ms. trichosporium OB3b transformed with pAWP89_p15a (A) compared to wild-type Ms. trichosporium OB3b (B) on 25 μ g/mL kanamycin NMS agar selection plates. this plasmid can be maintained in Ms. trichosporium OB3b (Fig. 2). For the",
  "purposes of overexpressing toxic methanotroph genes, we have replaced the origin of replication in pAWP89 with p15a to create pAWP89_p15a (Fig. 1; Table 3). 4. GENETIC MANIPULATION VIA CONJUGATION The most common and efficient method for genetic manipulation in methanotrophs requires conjugation (Lloyd et al., 1999; Murrell, 1994; Smith & Murrell, 2011). Typically after conjugation, the shuttle plasmid is incorporated into the chromosome of the recipient strain, followed by counterselection to ensure double recombination and removal of the vector backbone from the chromosome (Lalioti & Heath, 2001). In Ms. trichosporium OB3b, the established conjugation method involves the addition of liquid cultures of both methanotroph and E. coli cells onto a 0.2μ msterile filter paper for mating (Smith & Murrell, 2011). This protocol requires the use and subsequent dismantling of a plastic filter unit or a Pyrex microfiltration glass assembly, followed by cell recovery from filter paper, Genetic",

A simpler conjugation protocol has been developed for the Type I methanotrophs M. buryatense 5G and M. alcaliphilum 20Z (Ojala et al., 2011; Puri et al., 2015). We have modified this protocol, which requires only cells grown on agar plates and disposable cell spreaders, for conjugation in Ms. trichosporium OB3b (Fig. 3): The vector pk18 mobsacB or pk18 mobsacB _p15a (carrying an insert consisting of 5 0 and 3 0 DNA regions flanking the site of gene insertion, deletion, or mutagenesis, as well as any sequence to be inserted or altered) is transformed into the donor strain E. coli S17-1 via either heat shock or electroporation (Simon et al., 1983). Onedayprior to bacterial mating, the E. coli S17-1 cells are streaked onto LB agar plates to obtain a bacterial lawn.

  "conjugation, the introduced plasmid recombines into the targeted site in the chromosome during the first crossover. Transconjugant selection followed by sucrose counterselection induces a second crossover event to remove the plasmid backbone from the chromosome and produce the mutant with the gentamicin resistance cassette ( gen R ) disrupting gene A . genR Ms. trichosporium OB3b Agene A genome 342 Soo Y. Ro and Amy C. Rosenzweig The wild-type recipient strain Ms. trichosporium OB3bis streaked onto an NMSagar medium plate (Table 1) and given 1 week to grow, forming at least a partial bacterial lawn. The donor and recipient strains are harvested from plates and evenly plated and spread onto the same mating agar plate (Table 1) with a cell ratio of 2:1 donor-to-recipient strain. Specifically, a sterile cell spreader is dragged once across the plate containing the recipient methanotroph cells, and then is immediately used to inoculate the mating plate (Table 1). This is repeated for the",
  "donor ( E. coli ) strain, and the donor cells are plated directly on top of the recipient cells in the mating plate. These plates are then incubated at a 1:1 methane-to-air ratio for 48h at 30 ° C in a GasPak chamber. A fraction of the mated cells, just enough to be visible on the bottom of the sterile cell spreader, are scraped off the mating plate and directly plated onto a selection agar plate (Table 1) containing kanamycin (25 μ g/mL). The selection plate is incubated under the same conditions as the mating plate. Single transconjugant colonies that appear are picked with a sterile loop and separately streaked onto selection plates containing kanamycin (25 μ g/mL) as well as naladixic acid (10 μ g/mL) to eliminate remaining cells from the donor E. coli strain. Single transconjugant colonies on selection plates are picked using a sterile loop and streaked onto counterselection agar plates (Table 1) containing 2.5% sucrose and appropriate antibiotics. Single colonies from these",
  "counterselection plates are then picked and streaked once more to obtain sufficient biomass for genotype screening as described in Section 6.1. 5. GENE MANIPULATION VIA ELECTROPORATION In situations where cloning or conjugation fails, electroporation can be employed, as reported for Methylocella silvestris BL2, Methylocystis sp. strain SC2, and M. buryatense 5G (Baani & Liesack, 2008; Crombie & Murrell, 2011; Yan et al., 2016). Linear DNA fragments produced via PCR can be also electroporated into Ms. trichosporium OB3b and integrated into the chromosome (Dassama et al., 2016). Thus far, intact plasmids purified from E. coli cloning strains have not been successfully incorporated into Ms. trichosporium OB3b via this method. Genetic Manipulation of Ms. trichosporium OB3b 343 5.1 Construction of Linear DNA Fragment Homologous recombination of a linear DNA fragment is a technique used for gene disruption, insertion, and modification (Orr-Weaver, Szostak, & Rothstein, 1981; Sharan,",
  "Thomason, Kuznetsov, & Court, 2009). One common use of this technique is gene disruption via insertion of a linear DNA fragment containing an antibiotic resistance cassette into the middle of the target gene. Construction of the resulting linear DNA fragment can be performed via several methods, including fusion PCR (Shevchuk et al., 2004). In that method, /C24 500bp DNA regions flanking the gene of interest and a gentamicin resistance cassette are amplified by PCR. Primers are designed to add 25bp regions onto the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the gentamicin resistance cassette that overlap with the DNA regions flanking the gene of interest. The three PCR products are then joined together through two rounds of fusion PCR (Fig. 4). PCR products for each round of amplification are isolated and purified through gel extraction. In addition, it is necessary to perform a final cleanup of the PCR product using a PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) or equivalent technique prior to sequencing and",
  "electroporation. 5.2 Electrocompetent Cell Preparation 50mL cultures of Ms. trichosporium OB3b cells are grown in NMS medium (0.1 μ M CuSO4) as described in Section 2. Cells are harvested at an OD600 of 1.0, centrifuged at 7000 /C2 g at 4 ° Cfor 10min, and washed twice with 20mL of 10% sterile glycerol at 4 ° C before a final 1mL resuspension in 10% glycerol at 4 ° C. Fresh electrocompetent cells are recommended for every electroporation round. 5.3 Electroporation 100 -500ng of the linear DNA fragment is added to 100 μ L electrocompetent cells in sterile microcentrifuge tubes kept on ice. The mixture is then transferred into a prechilled sterile electroporation cuvette with a 0.2-cm gap width (Bio-Rad). The cuvette is inserted into an electroporation system (Bio-Rad MicroPulser) and subjected to one pulse at 2.2kV for 5ms at 1A ˚ . After electroporation, the cell mixture is added to 5mL of NMS liquid medium (without antibiotics) in borosilicate culture tubes sealed with rubber septa.",

TRICHOSPORIUM OB3B MUTANTS 6.1 DNA Extraction From Ms. trichosporium OB3b Cells on Agar Plates DNA extraction from Ms. trichosporium OB3b is less efficient than DNA extraction from many Type I or Type II methanotrophic bacteria. Existing methods use the neutral lysis/CsCl method or a DNeasy Blood Tissue Kit (Qiagen) for DNA extractions from liquid cultures (Gu et al., 2016; Smith & Murrell, 2011). However, growing liquid cultures to genotype multiple colonies is time-consuming. Instead, an improved method has been developed to extract DNA from cells growing on agar plates",
  "using the MasterPure Complete DNA Purification Kit (Epicentre, Cat. No. MC85200). This method allows for higher-throughput of genotype screening and provides increased yields of DNA from smaller amounts of cells. The MasterPure Complete DNA Purification Kit protocol has been modified for Ms. trichosporium OB3b: Add 20 μ L Proteinase K (NEB, 800U/mL) into 300 μ L 2 /C2 tissue and cell lysis solution for each sample. Drag a sterile inoculating loop across the agar plate culture until the loop is covered with cells (Fig. 5). Fig. 5 Amount of Ms. trichosporium OB3b cells required for DNA extraction shown on a 1μ L inoculating loop. 346 Soo Y. Ro and Amy C. Rosenzweig Swirl the inoculating loop in the lysis solution and resuspend fully by pipetting. Incubate the sample at 65 ° C overnight at 500rpm. Add 5 μ L RNase A (Epicentre, 5 μ g/ μ L). Incubate for 1h at 37 ° C without shaking. Place the samples on ice for 5min. Add 150 μ L MPC protein precipitation reagent and vortex. Centrifuge the",
  "sample at 10,000 /C2 g at 4 ° C for 10min to pellet cell debris. Transfer the supernatant to a new tube and add 500 μ L 100% isopropanol on ice. Manually invert the sample 30 times. Centrifuge the sample at 4 ° C for 30min at 20,000 /C2 g to pellet DNA. Wash the DNA pellet with 750 μ L 70% ethanol on ice. Centrifuge at 20,000 /C2 g at 4 ° C for 5min, remove the ethanol, and repeat the wash step once more. Let the pellet dry at 37 ° C until residual ethanol is gone. Resuspend the pellet with 50 μ L TE buffer and incubate overnight at 4 ° C. DNA yield can vary from 10 to 60 μ g. Additional cleanup steps using silica spin columns (Zymo) may be required for uses other than simple Sanger sequencing. 6.2 Genotyping Mutants To confirm the genotype of Ms. trichosporium OB3b variants, PCR amplification of the altered DNA region is performed. Due to the high genomic GCcontent of Type II methanotrophs, PCR amplification is more successful under reaction conditions optimized for high-GC samples,",
  "such as the 2 /C2 iProof GC Master Mix (Bio-Rad). 100ng of Ms. trichosporium OB3b genomic DNA is an appropriate starting point for a 50μ L PCR reaction. Gradient or touchdown PCR at annealing temperatures of 55 -65 ° C can be employed to identify conditions for specific amplification. PCR cleanup (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) will significantly improve sequencing results. 7. SUMMARY The modifications in plasmid design, construct delivery, and genotyping described here allow for simpler and more efficient genetic manipulation of Ms. trichosporium OB3b, at least until CRISPR or other Genetic Manipulation of Ms. trichosporium OB3b 347 gene editing methods are developed (Tian et al., 2017). These advances will expedite metabolic engineering efforts in this methanotrophic strain and enhance studies of proteins involved in the key processes of methanotrophy.
