Lyngby, Denmark Despite the expanding presence of microscale technology in chemical synthesis and energy production as well as in biomedical devices and analytical and diagnostic tools, its potential in biocatalytic processes for pharmaceutical and fine chemicals, as well as related industries, has not yet been fully exploited. The aim of this review is to shed light on the strategic advantages of this promising technology for the development and",
  "realization of biocatalytic processes and subsequent product recovery steps, demonstrated with examples from the literature. Constraints, opportunities, and the future outlook for the implementation of these key green engineering methods and the role of supporting tools such as mathematical models to establish sustainable production processes are discussed. Microfluidic devices for biocatalytic processes Increasing research efforts and the growing industrial interest in using microscale technology for continuous-flow organic synthesis and for various continuous-flow separations [1-6] shed new light on basic process development and sets a new paradigm for chemical production [7]. Progress in the fundamentals of biocatalysis and its applications in various industrial sectors over the past 50 years [8-10] have already established biocatalysis as a key technology for sustainable chemistry in numerous manufacturing processes for pharmaceuticals, flavors, fragrances, vitamins, and chemicals",
  "[11]. The quest for high-performance manufacturing technology places the combination of biocatalysis and microscale technology as a key green engineering method for process development and production [12-14]. The strategic advantages of microscale technology are reviewed with regard to minimizing the gap between the laboratory and the full-size manufacturing Corresponding author: Wohlgemuth, R.

Strategic advantages of microscale technology for manufacturing Small reactor size (at least one dimension below 1 mm, typically in the range 50-500 m m) and high surface-tovolume ratio (typically 10.000-50.000 m 2",
  "/m 3 ) together with a continuous operation mode resulting in, for example, improved mixing and energy efficiency, heat management, scalability, and safety and lower waste production, are strategic advantages of microfluidic systems over large-scale reactors [1-7]. Safety, health, and environmental advantages Point-of-use generation of toxic, explosive, and hazardous chemicals in situ within integrated microfluidic systems improves safety, health, and environment issues and allows multiple reactions and separations. For example, a robust Glossary Flow chemistry: continuous reactions conducted in microreactors combined with other microscale unit operations such as mixing, heating/cooling, phase separation, concentration, and extraction. In situ product removal (ISPR): a strategy aimed at the removal of an inhibitory product from the reaction mixture as soon as the product is formed, providing immediate relief of the inhibitory action. Lab on a chip: a device that integrates one or",
  "several laboratory functions on a single chip, while transporting and manipulating microliter amounts of fluids. Microfluidics: a research field that develops methods and devices to control, manipulate, and analyze flows on a nanoto microliter scale. Microreactor: a reactor with characteristic dimensions from submillimeter to submicrometer whose operation depends on precisely controlled design features. Microscale technology: technology based on processes and unit operations within microstructured devices. Monolithic microreactors: microscale reactors using organic polymers and silica-based monoliths with porous rod structures providing very efficient mass transfer due to convective flow, giving better accessibility to the biocatalyst active site, low back pressure, stability in most solvents, versatility of functional groups available for surface chemistry, and the possibility of preparing reactors in any size and shape. Multiscale modeling: computational methodology ranging from the",
  "molecular level to the continuum level. Process window: a collection of (biocatalytic) process parameter values that allow the reaching of a specific target, usually expressed in terms of productivity, product quality (purity), or economic process viability. 302 Trends in Biotechnology, May 2015, Vol. 33, No. 5 Review Trends in Biotechnology May 2015, Vol. 33, No. 5 microfluidic set-up for the in situ generation of hazardous ethyl diazoacetate used a dual-channel membrane enabling liquid-liquid separation and a capillary microreactor to perform cascade reactions in a sequential and continuous manner yielding negligible toxic waste [15]. The environmental impact could be significantly improved by using microfluidic devices offering better selectivity and yield and fewer byproducts. The type of manufacturing technology employed contributes to the lower amount of waste produced per amount of product for a petrochemical compared with products in the pharmaceutical/fine chemical industries",
  "[16]. The dimension-dependent benefits apply equally well to bioprocesses (e.g., enzymatic cyanohydrin synthesis) where smaller reaction volumes translate into smaller amounts of hydrogen cyanide (HCN) and hence improved safety with fewer risks [17]. High surface-to-volume ratio One of the most prominent benefits of microscale technology, compared with conventional platforms, is the dramatic increase in heat and mass transfer due to the higher surface-to-volume ratio of microreactors and the short diffusion paths [1-7]. For example, it is advantageous for catalytic reactions occurring on the inner surfaces of microchannel and monolithic reactors with immobilized biocatalysts as well as for packed-bed microreactors offering high catalyst load. Several approaches for surface modification enabling efficient enzyme and cell immobilization are known [18-21]. Further increases in the available surface for biocatalyst immobilization are obtained by the implementation of nanostructured",
  "materials such as nanosprings [22,23]. Product removal/product isolation The high surface-to-volume ratio of microscale reactors is of extreme value for integrated product removal (ISPR) (see Glossary) using either membranes [24] or two-liquid flow for in situ extraction [25-27], which among other factors enable improved catalytic efficiency overcoming thermodynamic limitations, enhanced product purity and prevention of catalyst poisoning, and deactivation by removing undesirable byproducts from the reaction zone. Membranes are integrated within microchannels either to achieve product separation or as a catalyst support. They could be made from various materials including zeolites, carbon nanofibers, metals, nylon, polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE), ceramics, or thin layers of ionic liquids acting as selective media for separation [24]. Continuous processing at smaller scales The introduction of miniaturized versions of tubular reactors, traditionally used for continuous processing in the",
  "petrochemical industry and for heterogeneous catalysis, into organic synthesis has established flow chemistry, opening new approaches and bridging the efforts of engineers and chemists toward sustainable production technology [5]. Continuous processing and bioprocesses have been recognized as the most important key green engineering research areas by pharmaceutical and fine chemicals manufacturers alike [13,28]. Continuous operations have major benefits in reduced costs, equipment size, energy consumption, solvent utilization, and waste. Furthermore, high product quality can be maintained in highly automated production plants incorporating control loops. Numerous applications such as 24/7 manufacturing, multistep synthesis, and repetitive or routine steps are possible [29]. Entirely new pathways can be developed using new processing steps available to continuous manufacturing, as recently demonstrated for the production of the pharmaceutical Aliskiren from advanced intermediates [30].",
  "The easy scaling of reaction conditions in microfluidic systems (Figure 1) is advantageous for the whole process chain [31]. Continuously operated biocatalytic reactions in microreactors, especially reactions at phase boundaries, have been shown to be superior to batch reactors [17-21,25-27]. Mobile process plants The size reduction to microscale devices opens new perspectives for on-demand production of high-energy or reactive reagents instead of their challenging storage and transport. The possibility of transporting the microreactor itself to the place where the starting material is available or where the product is required is an additional degree of freedom that is a great strategic advantage (Figure 1) and can be tailored to new application areas [7]. Better spatial and temporal control Among the most distinct strategic advantages of microreactors is their spatial and temporal reaction control. For example, the reaction time can be adjusted by altering the flow rate of the",
  "reagents added (e.g., in the lipase-catalyzed ring-opening polymerization of e -caprolactone to polycaprolactone [32]) or the reaction channel length [33]. Reaction time control is advantageous for short-lived reactive species, which can be generated and transported to the place of the next reaction before decomposition occurs. Improved transport in multiphasic systems The application of microstructured mixing devices, using active and passive mixing principles, have led to great improvements for miscible liquids and represent a strategic advantage over mixing in batch reactions. Mixing multiphase systems like immiscible liquids becomes even more important, because if one reactant in one phase needs to react with another reactant in a second phase, the flow dynamics and the promotion of phase contacting and mixing are critical parameters for the subsequent reaction [2]. Better control of fluid flow, short diffusion paths, and high interfacial areas have driven the application of",
  "microstructured devices for biocatalytic processing in multiphase systems. Enzymatic microscale reactions in twoliquid-phase systems, often used for poorly water-soluble compounds, to increase biocatalyst stability and/or the yield of thermodynamically limited reactions by in situ product extraction, has been reviewed [26,27]. The use of multiphase systems in enzymatic microreactors shows benefits for bioprocess intensification (Table 1). Energy efficiency The microstructured reactor consumes two to three times less mechanical energy than the equivalent fixed-bed reactor, achieving equal productivities for a heterogeneously 303 Review Trends in Biotechnology May 2015, Vol. 33, No. 5 Continuous in situ production Micro-units Microscale manufacturing sequence with mobile small- footprint flow reactors Chemicals supply Figure 1 .

  "microscale manufacturing sequence compared with the large footprint of fixed batch reactors is illustrated for an industrial plant, but this strategic advantage extends far beyond industrial synthesis to various areas of decentralized just-in-time manufacturing.

Lower power consumption for",
  "mixing multiphase systems is evident from comparing microdroplet/microemulsion formation by pumping two phases within microfluidic systems of specific geometry and energy-consuming stirring in large-scale reactors. The continuous-flow synthesis of a key steroid intermediate for an endothelin receptor antagonist in a microreactor by the Barton reaction using a 15-W black-light source illustrates efficient energy use in photomicroreaction systems [35]. Plug-and-play construction of process configuration The ease with which configuration changes can be made at a microscale is often perceived as an additional advantage compared with large-scale manufacturing equipment. Efficient lipase-catalyzed synthesis of isoamyl acetate in a two-liquid-phase system enabling the reuse of solvent with the dissolved enzyme was developed using commercially available microfluidic units. A miniaturized process system comprising an X-junction glass microfluidic chip provided droplet flow with a very large",
  "interfacial area for the reaction and simultaneous product separation in a silanized polymeric microchannel and a membrane-based phase microseparator [36]. The fully integrated continuous two-step synthesis of Aliskiren at a nominal throughput of 41 g/h illustrates a process configuration comprising tubular reactors and membrane-based separators that were scaled up from microfluidic designs [30]. Faster process development A broader range of reaction conditions can be explored in the development of a process with a given amount of starting material because experiments at a microscale can be performed with reduced reagent consumption. 304 Review Trends in Biotechnology May 2015, Vol. 33, No. 5 Table 1.

A highly sensitive",
  "and high-throughput screening system for new enzymes was demonstrated in microfluidic droplet compartments using only picoliter amounts of cell lysate. A microfluidic platform for directed enzyme evolution in which water-in-oil droplet compartments serve to miniaturize cell lysate assays by a million-fold was reported by Kintses and coworkers [37]. Automated on-line determination of reaction rate parameters can provide reaction kinetics faster and more efficiently [38]. Enzyme inhibition can be measured rapidly with a uniform substrate concentration, an inhibitor concentration gradient using a single microchannel, and a single initial inhibitor concentration [39]. Fast estimation of the immobilized enzyme activity has also been achieved in a segmented-flow reactor [40]. Process conditions like pH, substrate inlet concentration and flow rate, cell permeabilization conditions, and catalyst stability were evaluated, and optimized, within a very short time and under more controlled",
  "conditions when polymeric microchannels were used for L-malic acid production by permeabilized yeast cells compared with their batch counterparts [41]. Expanded biocatalytic process windows The benefit of microreactors for increased process performance by applying novel process windows such as high temperatures, high pressures, and high concentrations 305 Review Trends in Biotechnology May 2015, Vol. 33, No. 5 Substrate/product concentration Reaction rate Toxicity/inhibition Box 1. Expanded biocatalytic process windows Reaction boundaries like reaction rate, toxicity, catalyst inactivation over time (total turnover number), and downstream processing using a window of operation for whole-cell biocatalysis were introduced by Woodley and Titchener-Hooker [93]. Reaction rate acceleration due to the reduction in diffusion path and increased mass transfer in twophase systems within microscale reactors is the most suitable driving force for bioprocess intensification. Time Considering",
  "toxicity and biocatalyst deactivation, various studies have proved the benefit of using microscale technology. Continuous microprocessing with multi-input addition of toxic substrates was suggested to prevent catalyst inactivation [94]. Almost 2 months of production at maximal volumetric productivity was enabled by the continuous feed of a toxic substrate and in situ product extraction over a silicone tube that prevented the inhibition of Pseudomonas sp. cells performing asymmetric epoxidation of styrene [95]. The use of a flow reactor enabled higher quantities of oxidant to be employed for lipase-mediated oxidation of alkenes over prolonged periods of time without deactivation of the biocatalyst [62]. Very short reaction times for acrylamide synthesis in microreactors also greatly weakened the inhibition of Rhodococcus ruber cells by acrylonitrile and acrylamide. Furthermore, the temperature of this exothermic reaction could be much more efficiently controlled compared with",
  "traditional stirring in a conventional reactor leading to additional lowering of biocatalyst deactivation and prevention of byproduct formation [91]. Another critical parameter for enzyme-catalyzed reactions is leaching of enzymes from solid beads, contaminating products and reducing biocatalyst (immobilized enzyme) lifetime. A study of ringopening polymerization of e -caprolactone to polycaprolactone using a packed-bed microreactor with Candida antarctica lipase-B in the form of Novozym 435 indicated that enzyme leaching from porous beads was lower in microreactors compared with batch reactors [32]. The last boundary of the bioprocess window of operation (Figure I) is the efficiency of downstream processing. Typically very low demonstrated for various types of chemical reaction [7] provides new opportunities for biocatalytic reactions. High pressure is a reaction parameter with huge potential for enzyme catalysis and has already been highlighted [42]. Dissolving carbon dioxide at 280",
  "bar in the lipaseB-catalyzed solvent-free synthesis of polyglycerol-3-laurate resulted in a fourfold reaction rate increase [43]. Limitations of bioprocess operation windows related to reaction rate, substrate or product toxicity/inhibition, biocatalyst stability and/or leaching from the reactor, and downstream processing could be overcome by using microscale devices (Box 1). Microreactor technology for manufacturing of biosynthetic products The availability of technologies for building microstructured devices in a controlled and repeatable manner enables the design of microreactors from various materials using a large number of strategies for integrating and releasing reagents [44]. Furthermore, in-line process analysis and control and biocatalyst configuration, as well as integration with downstream processing and possibilities for scale-out, are important considerations in the manufacturing of microfluidic systems [45]. Microreactor manufacturing and materials Materials used in",
  "microreactor manufacturing have to be accepted and compatible with industrial production requirements, reagents, solvents, and processes. A wide range of bioproduct concentrations represent a huge challenge resulting in up to 90% of production costs needed for product isolation. Studies considering liquid-liquid extraction of bioproducts within microfluidic systems clearly confirm the benefit of taking advantage of the high surface-to-volume area and short diffusion paths in either microflow systems with parallel flow enabling phase separation at the exit [25] or droplet or segmented flow, where further phase separation is needed [36]. Figure I . Microscale technologies offer improvements in reaction rate and downstream processing efficiency as well as an increased possibility of preventing the toxic effects of substrate/product on cells and biocatalyst deactivation and/or leaching compared with conventional technology, primarily due to increased mass transfer, higher surface-to-volume",

Microreactors can be adapted to bioprocess needs, as demonstrated with the multi-input reactor in the transketolase-catalyzed synthesis of L-erythrulose [22]. That there are only two patents for microreactors designed for biocatalytic reactions indicates the development opportunities [47]. Biocatalytic processes in microfluidic systems encompass a broad range of materials and systems, ranging from simple capillaries and tubing to custom-made",
  "microchannels, monoliths, and microstructured reactors with inserted nanomaterial (Table 2). Enzymatic microreactors can be classified with respect to shape, materials used, and interface preparation or with respect to flow characteristics. Y-shaped, C -shaped, Tshaped, X-shaped, or tapered are the most common microchannel shapes, made mainly from glass, silicon, ceramic, stainless steel, or polymer materials. Immobilized enzyme processing and interface preparation in microreactors are emerging technologies implemented to increase the surface area as a major factor in enzymatic microreactors. Structures can be etched from, cast into, deposited onto, or grown directly from microchannel surfaces [46]. Wall-coated supports and especially nanosprings or other nanostructured materials are recognized as another efficient method to increase surface area and enzyme loading in microreactors [22,23,48].

Biocatalyst configuration Biocatalysts in microreactors can be used in soluble form or flow freely through the reactors in the form of channels [25,49-51] or with integrated membranes enabling enzyme separation and recycling [52,53]. Biocatalyst immobilization, which may also improve stability and simplify product separation [20,21], can be",
  "achieved on the inner surface of the microchannels [21,41,54-58], in microscale reactors with monolithic structures [59-61] or nanostructured material within the microspace [22,23], entrapped in the bulk space within porous structures [32,62-68] or with the assistance of a magnetic field [69] (Table 2). For example, a comparison of various immobilization methods and supports for threonine aldolases showed a sufficient loading performance under best performance assumptions only when high-value products like pharmaceuticals were considered [23]. Bioprocess intensification and development using either free or immobilized biocatalysts in enzymatic microreactors with nonaqueous media also shows benefits (Table 3). Process analytical and control technology Process analytical technology (PAT) may be efficiently implemented in microreactors due to the high degree of automation and process controllability achievable in small-scale continuous equipment [70]. The use of sensors to analyze",
  "critical parameters and incorporation of the corresponding actuators to exploit the results of the analytical devices are important for general process control. Dissolved oxygen concentrations were monitored on line in a microreactor at various flow rates and microchannel dimensions in the glucose oxidase-catalyzed oxidation of D-glucose [71]. Accurate 2D oxygen imaging was achieved with an oxygen-sensitive platinum-porphyrin complex in the microfluidic system and a color charge-coupled device (CCD) camera, a set up that can be parallelized or applied to resolve oxygen concentrations spatially and temporally inside microfluidic channels [72]. While temperature and pH sensors measure key reaction parameters and are routine inprocess analysis techniques suitable for industrial manufacturing, spectroscopic analyses provide more detailed information but are limited to the laboratory scale. IRand UV-visible light detection linked to flow systems is attractive for on-line monitoring [3].",
  "Classical HPLC, often used in microreactor analysis, is a key component of an automated microfluidic system for online optimization [73]. Microreactor technology has been combined with capillary flow NMR spectroscopy, whereby the two reactants, fed separately and mixed effectively in a micromixer into the probe head, pass through a capillary Enzyme Product(s) (E) 309 Review Trends in Biotechnology May 2015, Vol. 33, No. 5 Table 3.

For example, an integrated microfluidic system was developed that included the cascade generation, extraction, separation, and reaction of hazardous ethyl diazoacetate with aldehydes to yield 2-keto esters with subsequent",
  "gas-liquid separation [15]. Efficient enzyme-catalyzed cholesterol oxidation with in situ product removal was achieved by the parallel flow of an organic and an aqueous phase with phase separation at the exit of a Y-shaped microchannel system (Figure 2). Phase separation was achieved by the establishment of a laminar interface between the two parallel flows throughout the channel length at the position of the inlet and outlet junctures of Y-shaped channels resulting from the adjustment of flow rates ratio according to the relative viscosity of the fluids. The microfluidic device, further integrated with a packed-bed reactor containing immobilized catalase, resulted in continuous cholestenone synthesis for > 300 h at more than 30% of the initial cholesterol oxidase activity [25]. A packed-bed microbioreactor was also integrated with a miniaturized separator for continuous lipase-catalyzed butyl-butyrate synthesis [65]. Simulations enabling process development Many biocatalytic processes",
  "at the microreactor scale have been theoretically described using validated mathematical models on the macroscopic level. Likewise, on-line validated mathematical models have been developed to depict the governing transport characteristics [71]. Finite difference/volume/element (FD/FV/FE) methods, based on the discretization of the continuous form of the relevant transport equations, are the most common macroscale simulation techniques. However, such techniques based on a continuum approximation may not always be readily adapted to describe transport processes and chemical interactions that occur in processes at the microscale. The macroscopic models are often unable to provide conclusive evidence for a given mechanism in systems with the complexity characterizing almost all biochemical processes. By contrast, atomistic-scale simulation techniques, such as molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, can track the motion of individual molecules and allow precise",
  "reconstruction of the molecular architecture and properties. Since the use of these atomistic methods to probe the dynamic behavior at higher scales remains impractical, particle-based mesoscale methods possess the unique ability to model relatively large physical systems and simultaneously effectively capture the essential features of the microand nanoscale structure, architecture, and relevant interactions [75]. Due to the fact that microfluidic phenomena arising from microdevices are characterized by a hierarchal multiscale nature with respect to space and time, hierarchical multiscale modeling is a promising potential tool for developing, designing, and optimizing bioprocesses at the microscale. It aims to develop a viable multiscale computational methodology to improve understanding and predictions of complex physicochemical phenomena in spatial and temporal domains ranging from the molecular level to the continuum level [76]. Although the chemical engineering community has",
  "traditionally been interested in macroscopic continuum models, micro-, meso-, and macro-scales can be linked and integrated to improve understanding and predictions of complex chemical engineering phenomena. Multiscale modeling may help to design and optimize microsystems technology for biocatalytic processes from a microscopic perspective. Moreover, to move lab-on-a-chip biochemistry to the pilot and production scale, multiscale modeling can be implemented for scale out/scale up or numbering up of optimization design (Figure 3). 310 Review Trends in Biotechnology May 2015, Vol. 33, No. 5 Time h S IS 15 - Ab initio pm Engineering design - Scale-up, scale-out, numbering-up Downstream Microreactor Figure 3 .

  "processes in industrial manufacturing remains slow due to several perceived barriers [16,77,78]. Standardized reactor modules that can be combined in various sequences to test novel biocatalytic processes are crucial for rapid development. The feasibility of a wide area of dimensionand timedependent biocatalytic reactions can be explored at the microscale. High space-time yields, high selectivity, and complete conversion are key goals in process intensification and resource efficiency. Microreactors are also of interest for rapid process development if PAT matches the reaction timescale [79,80]. Real-time product analysis is key for quality by design (QbD) of the manufacturing process.

Advances in biocatalyst discovery to biocatalytic microprocess design require not only a new level of understanding of reaction mechanisms and transport phenomena at the microscale, but also computational tools and advanced microsensors to optimize and control bioprocesses in working environments from chemical and energy resources to products. It is important to define key performance indicators as development targets early in projects toward economically viable bioprocesses. Few studies consider increasing the volumetric production rate at the microscale, to design equipment for larger-scale production, and to perform holistic process analysis (e.g., for complex biobased molecules whose production in microdevices remains at an early stage [83]).

In practice, challenges related to the handling of particles and slurries, often leading to clogging of microscale channels and thereby preventing stable microscale reactor operation, as well as differences in capacities of unit operations, necessitate customized reactor design and make plug-andplay construction difficult to realize in practice [85]. Concluding remarks and future perspectives The development of integrated reaction-separation systems at the microscale leading to process intensification of biocatalytic processes [36,65], as well as the increased capability of using mathematical models to predict phenomena in microscale devices, are some of the most significant advances in this field.",
  "Development of a microfluidic platform for directed evolution, using water-in-oil-droplet compartments for screening [37], plays a significant role in faster process development, while multi-inlet microfluidic reactors for controlled addition of inhibitory/toxic substrates [22] and microfluidic devices with entrapped biocatalysts using a magnetic field [69] indicate new possibilities for the establishment of highly efficient biocatalytic processes with long-term stability. The further expansion of microreactors into process development will proceed from established analytical platforms using both continuous and droplet assays. Reductions in development time and cost can be achieved by activity-based reaction screening as a function of pH, temperature, reaction conditions, and substrate scope or by end point determinations. Multiphase flow conditions, where flow instabilities, fast biocatalyst inactivation, and low conversion rates are often encountered [26,27], provide opportunities",
  "for process intensification. Continuous processes will constitute a key research area for the engineering of green and sustainable processes [28]. Microscale technology and flow chemistry is not yet used as much for manufacturing as is batch reactor technology and myths of it not being useful for production persist. Therefore, to be convincing, documenting and reporting the significant advantages for a rapidly growing range of reaction types, in direct comparison with batch reactor technology, is essential. The recent microreactor synthesis of ibuprofen in three sequential reaction steps with each reaction completed within 1 min, leading to an overall reaction time of 3 min and 83% overall yield, demonstrates the capabilities of continuous-flow manufacturing for multistep syntheses using small-footprint reactors [86]. The further development of more precise reaction control in microreactors by suppressed formation of undesired products or byproducts, as well as in situ preparation of",
  "reactive species only when they are needed, will enable telescoped flow synthesis from simple precursors [87]. The higher efficiency of microreactors over batch systems for biphasic gas/liquid systems offers the merits of more convenient protocols [87,88] and the tools for new synthetic manufacturing routes. Reagents can be prevented from destructive interactions and the formation of undesired byproducts by introducing reagents at specific stages of the microscale system, leading to a broader substrate scope and higher reactivity and yield compared with batch processes [88]. An (R)-selective v -transaminase with pyridoxal-5 0 -phosphate immobilized on methacrylate beads in organic solvent enabled the transamination of ketones in a microreactor with a residence time of 30-60 min, > 99% enantiomeric excess (ee), and excellent mass recovery, demonstrating a clean production system without additional work up and purification [67].
