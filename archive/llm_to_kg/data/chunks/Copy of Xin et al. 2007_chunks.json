Methanol  can  be  produced  chemically  via  methane, carbon dioxide, biomass, coal, heavy fuel oils etc. (Arakawa 1998, Cybulski 1994, Marchionna et  al. 1998, Rozovskii  and  Lin  1999,  Lange  2001).

  "methanol dehydrogenase), is particularly appealing (Obert and Dave 1999. In the process, the ability of the dehydrogenases to catalyze the reverse reactions in the presence of an excess of reducing equivalent has been exploited to facilitate reductions of carbon dioxide that are difficult to achieve using traditional chemical methods. However, the process presents some technical problems; for example, in order to keep the conversion process  going,  costly  reduced  nicotinamide  adenine dinucleotide (NADH) must be used as reducing equivalent for each dehydrogenase-catalyzed reaction. NADH is  depleted  in  the  reaction  and  subsequently  more NADH must be added.

In addition,  intermediates  of  the  pathway  may  be  used  in other  reactions,  diluted  and  exposed  to  bulk  solvent where they may be degraded. We  have  investigated  whether  microorganisms  can be used as biocatalysts for the reduction of carbon dioxide  to  methanol,  to  overcome  the  above-mentioned drawbacks,  since  the  enzymes  are  likely  to  be  more stable  in  the  cell  than  in  the  purified  form  and  will ensure  a  continuing  supply  of  NADH.  Unfortunately, up to now, there are no known organisms whose normal  biological  role  is  reduction  of  carbon  dioxide  to methanol.",
  "There  are  microorganisms  called  methane-oxidizing bacteria or methanotrophs that can utilize methane as their sole carbon source and energy source for growing. In these organisms, methane is oxidized via methanol, formaldehyde and formate to carbon dioxide with some formaldehyde  being  incorporated  into  cell  biomass (Hanson  and  Hanson  1996).  The  first  reaction  in  the methane  oxidation  pathway  is  catalyzed  by  methane monooxygenase  (MMO).  MMO  utilize  two  reducing equivalents to split the O-O bonds of dioxygen. One of the  oxygen  atoms  is  reduced  to  form  H 2 O,  and  the other is incorporated into methane to form methanol. Methanol  from  endogenous  (methane  oxidation  via MMO)  is  oxidized  via  formaldehyde  and  formate  to carbon dioxide by methanol dehydrogenase, formaldehyde dehydrogenases and formate dehydrogenase. Most of  the  reducing power required for the metabolism of methane is produced by the oxidation of formaldehyde via formate to",
  "carbon dioxide. The carbon dioxide produced  from  methane  oxidation  is  partly  emitted  and partly  incorporated  into  cell  biomass  via  the  serine pathway (Hanson and Hanson 1996). Reducing carbon dioxide to methanol is the reverse of  the  oxidation  of  methanol.  In  the  previous  works (Xin et al. 2004a , 2004b), we have explored the feasibility  of  using  the  methanotrophic cell for the methanol production  from  carbon  dioxide.  The  results  showed  that  carbon  dioxide  can  be  reduced  into  methanol  by  methanotrophs.  It  is  possible  and  feasible  to reduce carbon dioxide to methanol by methanotrophic whole cells containing formate dehydrogenase, formaldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  methanol  dehydrogenase, despite  the  fact  that  these  enzymes  normally  oxidize their substrates in vivo or in vitro .  Since MMO cannot effectively catalyze the reverse reaction of methane monooxygenation, extracellular methanol accumulation  has  been  found  in  the",
  "carbon  dioxide  incubations. Reducing  carbon  dioxide  to  methanol  is  energy  intensive and requires a considerable amount of reducing equivalent  to  push  the  reaction  along  against  energy laws.  Resting  cells  of  methanotrophs  have  a  finite  or intrinsic  catalytic  capacity  for  methanol  production from carbon dioxide reduction due to a limiting supply of  intracellular  reducing  power.  The  limitation  due  to reducing equivalent availability can be offset by adding NADH. Whereas NADH may serve directly as reducing power, storage polymers such as polyβ -hydroxybutyrate  (PHB)  may  serve  as  an  endogenous  source  of reductant in microorganisms. PHB can be accumulated as an intracellular carbon and energy storage material by  a  variety  of  microorganisms  under  nitrogen,  phosphate, or  oxygen  limiting  condition.  As  shown  in Figure 1,  Methanotrophs  may  accumulate  PHB  by  two possible  pathway  of  carbon  assimilation,  the  ribulose monophosphate",
  "pathway (RMP) and the serine pathway (Asenjo and Suk 1986). Methanotrophs are classified as type I  or  type II,  depending  on  the  differences  in  the membrane structure and in the assimilation pathways. Type II bacteria using the serine pathway are the most effective  PHB  producers  (Wendlandt et al. 2001).  The first step in the conversion of methane into PHB is carried  out  by  nonspecific  MMO  enzyme  systems  (Asenjo and  Suk  1986).  In  certain  methanotrophs,  such  as Figure 1.

  "monooxygenase, sMMO) is produced when Cu is inadequate, while a  membrane bound particulate form (particulate methane monooxygenase, pMMO) of the enzyme is produced when  sufficient  Cu  is  present  (Park et  al. 1991,  1992, Stanley et al. 1983). Cells producing pMMO have a faster growth rate and higher catalytic activities with methane. PHB is an internal reducing-energy storage polymer that  can  be  used  as  an  alternative  reducing-energy source by a number of methanotrophs cultures under starvation  conditions  (Davis et al. 1964).  In  the  PHB cycle pathways shown in Figure 1, the series of reaction involving the conversion of acetyl CoA to PHB and its depolymerization  and  oxidation  back  to  acetoacetyl CoA,  are  confirmed  by  Korotkova  (Korotkova  and  Lidstrom 2001). The degradation of PHB in most bacteria is  catalyzed  by  PHB  depolymerase, β -hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase,  acetoacetate-succinate-CoA  transferase and β -ketothiolase.  Degradation  of  PHB  to",
  "acetoacetic acid would provide reducing equivalents via the action of  the  NAD + -linked β -hydroxybutyrate  dehydrogenase. A  number  of  studies  observed  a  correlation  between Trichloroethylene  (TCE)  oxidation  capacities  and  microbial PHB content (Henry and Grbic /combiningacuteaccent -Galic /combiningacuteaccent 1991, Henrysson  and  McCarty  1993,  Chu  and  Alvarez-Cohen 1996), suggesting that PHB might be used as an alternative NADH source for TCE oxidation by methanotrophs. The presence of endogenous reducing power reserves may  have  great  significance  in  methanol  production from  carbon  dioxide.  Resting  methanotrophic  strains containing PHB as endogenous reducing power reserves may  retain  the  ability  to  reduction  carbon  dioxide longer than strains without PHB. In the present article, in order to assess better some practical applications of the resting cells in the production  of  methanol  from  CO 2 reduction, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 was studied to",

The correlation between total methanol production capacities and microbial  PHB  content  was  investigated.  Also,  the  effects of methanol biosynthesis process on survival and recovery of M. trichosporium IMV 3011 were examined.

  "Under routine cultivation conditions, liquid cultures were  grown  in  50 ml  medium  in  500 ml  Shake-flask. Shake-flask were stoppered with rubber seal and gassed with a methane: air (1:1, v/v) gas mixture. The gas-toliquid  ratio  in  the  flasks  was  9:1.  The  gas  phase  was replenished every 12 h with the same gas mixture. The cultivation  of  cells  was  carried  out  at  30 °C  for  about 96 h. Under PHB accumulation cultivation conditions, various concentrations of CuSO 4 , NH 4 Cl and KNO 3 were added to mineral salt medium as described in the text for  manipulation  of  PHB  content  in  the  cells  and evaluation the effect of PHB on the bacterial capacity to synthesize  methanol.

The concentration of methanol was calculated  by  using  peak  areas  for  the  characteristic methanol  band  in  the  chromatogram.

Formaldehyde was also determined by reaction with the acetylacetone reagent (Malashenko et al . 2000). Methanol production by resting cell suspensions Cells were harvested as described above. The methanol produced in the batch reaction was carried out as follows.  Batch  experiments  were  conducted  in  100 ml sealed conical flasks (under atmospheric pressure) containing 10 ml washed cell suspension.

Results and discussion Methanol production by resting cells pre-grown under routine cultivation conditions M. trichosporium IMV 3011 is a strain of type II methanotroph (Xin et al. 2002). As shown in Fig. 1, in methanotrophs methane is oxidized to carbon dioxide in a linear pathway. Reducing  carbon dioxide to methanol  is the  reverse  of  the  oxidation  of  methanol.  It  has  been found  that  resting  cell  suspensions  of M.  trichosporium IMV 3011  can  reduce  carbon  dioxide  to  methanol, which accumulated in the reaction medium. No product  peak  other  than  methanol  from  carbon  dioxide reduction  was  detected.  For  the  whole  cell-catalyzed pathway to synthesize methanol, three dehydrogenases catalyzing the",
  "sequential reduction of carbon dioxide to methanol  may  be  in  close  proximity  to  one  another within the cell. Thus, reducing equivalents, substrates and  intermediates  have  shorter  distances  to  travel  to each enzyme. Product of one enzyme acts as a substrate of other, and is available for the active site of next enzyme without much diffusion.

  "dioxide reduction was accumulated and excreted out of the  cells.  The  production  of  methanol  from  carbon dioxide  reached  a  maximum  after  24 h  of  incubation. The amount of methanol slowly declined after further incubation (Fig. 2), perhaps through enzymatic or nonenzymatic  degradation  of  methanol,  depletion  of intracellular reducing equivalents (eg. NAD(P)H or PQQH ), the loss of CO 2 by leak and product inhibition etc. The  effect  of  product  inhibition,  enzymatic  or  nonenzymatic degradation of methanol and the loss of CO 2 by  leak  can  be  overcome  or  reduced  by  resuspending the cells in fresh medium and conducting a repetitive batch experiments as described in materials and methods section. However, in the repetitive batch methanol production experiments, cells also lost almost 100% of their initial methanol production ability after 4 repetitions of the process. This may be attributed to depletion of  the  endogenous  intracellular  reducing  equivalents",
  "(eg. NAD(P)H or PQQH ). PHB as possible source of endogeneous reductants for CO 2 reduction The  ability  of  methanotrophs  to  transform  CO 2 to methanol may  be limited by reducing equivalent consumption.  The  transformation,  however,  is  of  no benefit to the cells as they typically consume reducing equivalent  from  this  transformation. M. trichosporium IMV  3011  can  accumulate  PHB  as  carbon  source  and energy source reserve. Fig. 3 showed an electron micrograph  of  an  ultra-thin  section  of  cells  of  the  strain M. trichosporium IMV 3011. PHB exists as discrete inclusions or granule in the bacterial cells. With the intention  of  enhancement  of  the  capacity of  carbon  dioxide  conversion  to  methanol,  PHB  was chosen  as  a  source  of  reducing  power  in  our  experiment. To evaluate PHB as a possible source of reducing power,  the  effect  of  its  monomer,  3-hydroxybutyrate, was examined as the test substrate. As shown in Fig. 4, addition of",
  "3-hydroxybutyrate enhanced the methanol production capacity in the repetitive batch CO 2 conversion  reaction.  There  are  at  least  two  possible  explanations for the result. The first is that the PHB in resting cells can be used as a direct or indirect source of reducing  power.  The  second  is  that  PHB  is  a  marker  for  a higher  reducing  power  state  in  the  cells;  i.e.,  when internal  reducing  power  is  in  excess  of  growth  needs, the cells produce PHB.

Effect of nitrate, ammonium and copper on PHB accumulation in growing cells PHB formation can be affected by various conditions. It has  also  been  reported  that  the  synthesis  of  PHB  is stimulated in cells grown under nutrient-limited conditions,  including  nitrogen,  phosphate,  or  oxygen  limiting  condition  (Shah et al. 1996).  Also,  the  first  step  in the",
  "conversion  of  methane  into  PHB  is  catalyzed  by methane  monooxygenase  (MMO).  It  has  been  found that  the  form  and  catalytic  activity  of  MMO  can  be controlled  by  Cu  (Park et al. 1991,  1992,  Stanley et al. 1983). In an attempt to increase PHB accumulation in the earlier stages of fermentation, cell protein synthesis was limited by further reducing the level of nitrogen in the  culture  medium  containing  various  concentration of Cu. The nitrogen limitation was imposed by decreasing the liquid medium KNO 3 and NH 4 Cl concentration. As  shown in  Fig. 5,  for  cells  cultured  in  medium  containing  0 g/l,  0.002 g/l  and  0.004 g/l  CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O,  a similar  pattern  associated  with  KNO 3 or  NH 4 Cl  reduction  was  observed.  Under  these  initial  Cu  concentration, the reduction of KNO 3 by factors of 2 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.8 g/l), 4 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.4 g/l) and 8 (from 1.6 g/l to 0.2 g/l)  did  not  result  in  an  obvious  increase  in  PHB",
  "accumulation with 168 h fermentation. However, one- fifth  NH 4 Cl  (0.1 g/l)  resulted  in  the  highest  PHB  accumulation  with  168 h  fermentation.  Further  reduction of NH 4 Cl resulted in an obvious decrease in PHB accumulation with 168 h fermentation. This indicated that at NH 4 Cl concentration lower than 0.1 g/l, the synthesis of  the  enzymes  catalyzing  the  conversion  of  methane into PHB may be limited by further reducing the level of  nitrogen  in  the  culture  medium.  Based  on  the  results, 1.6 g/l KNO 3 and 0.1 g/l NH 4 Cl were chosen in the culture medium to use in subsequent studies . As shown in Fig. 5, in addition to the Nitrogen depletion, a limitation of Cu may trigger further accumulation of PHB by this bacterium. These data are in agreement  with  previous  reports  that  a  Cu  limitation  triggers the accumulation of PHB  in methane-grown bacteria (Shah et al. 1996). Because the stress caused by the NH 4 Cl and Cu limitation resulted in a high cellular",
  "PHB content, Cu was further chosen as the effect factor to  induce  PHB  accumulation  in  our  experiment. M. trichosporium IMV  3011  was  cultivated  in  mineral  salt medium with various concentrations of CuSO 4 .  It  was of  interest  to  measure  the  PHB  contents  of  batchcultured  cells  in  medium  containing  varying  Cu  concentration.  As  shown  in  Fig. 6, M. trichosporium IMV 3011 cells  grown  in  mineral  salt  medium  containing 0.002 g/l CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O exhibit a highest PHB accumulation,  a  PHB  accumulation  of  41.0%  was  reached  at 168 h. For cells cultured in mineral salt medium lacking Cu, a PHB accumulation of 7.5% (w/w) was reached at  168 h.  The  increased  PHB  contents  in  the  presence of copper may  be  due  to an improved  efficiency with which M. trichosporium IMV 3011 produces energy (NADH and/or ATP) during methane oxidation to CO 2 . However, further higher copper concentration adversely  affect  the  PHB  accumulation.  CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O",
  "concentration  exceeded  0.002 g/l  resulted  in  a  lower PHB  accumulation.  When  batch  cultivation  were  carried  out  under  0.003 g/l  and  0.004 g/l  CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O concentration,  PHB  accumulation  was  decreased  to only  30.3%  and  12.2%  at  168 h,  respectively.  The  reason  for  this  may  be  an  excess  of  copper  suppress  the large-stage  rise  in  PHB.  However,  the  reduction  of CuSO 4 concentration from 0.004 g/l to 0.002 g/l resulted in  slightly  lower  cell  yields  (data  not  shown).  This  observation  demonstrates  that  copper  has  an  important role  in  controlling  the  PHB  accumulation  of M.  trichosporium IMV 3011. These data suggest that it is possible to increase the internal PHB content in cells by Cu concentration  control.  Hence,  with  regard  to M. trichosporium IMV 3011,  mineral  salt  medium  containing 0.002 g/l  CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O  was  recommend  for  the  PHB accumulation. © 2007 WILEY-VCH Verlag GmbH & Co.

For  cells  obtained after 168h cultivation in mineral salt medium containing  0.002 g/l  CuSO 4 · 5 H 2 O,  the  cells  contained  a  high level  of  PHB (41%). The cells containing 41% PHB lost one-third of their accumulated PHB after 4 repetitions of the batch process (each cycle is 24 h in length). Furthermore, they retained 53% of their methanol synthesis  activity  after  4  repetitions  of  the  process  (the  total methanol production capacity was 0.026 (μmol/mg dry cell  wt)).  However,  slight  depletion  of  PHB  has  been found in the",
  "control batch with N 2 instead of CO 2 . It is suspected  that  the  methanotrophic  bacteria  may  rely on  PHB  for  a  source  of  electrons  and  energy  during starvation. Also, no methanol has been found in control batch with N 2 instead of CO 2 . Table 2 Summarizes the PHB contents and the corresponding total methanol production capacities for cell samples  cultivated  under  optimum  mineral  salt  medium  at  different  time.  The  repetitive  batch  reaction was continued until the subsequent methanol production ceased after seven or eight cycles. Total methanol production  capacity  is  calculated  by  adding  the  celldependent methanol formation during each cycle. A correlation between the amount of PHB in the cells and the total methanol production capacity was found. The total methanol production capacity of resting cells containing 38.6% PHB was 1.9-fold greater than that of Figure 7.

It  is  proposed  that PHB serve as an endogenous source of electrons for CO 2 reduction.  However,  the  total  methanol  production capacity slightly decreased when the cellular PHB contents exceeded 38.6%. The reason for this may be dilution of the dehydrogenase system in the cells with increasing  PHB  contents.  Hence,  with  regard  to M. trichosporium IMV  3011  the  application  of  resting  cells with a PHB content of 38.6% was recommend for the methanol synthesis from CO 2 . Survival and recovery of the cells after repeated batches of methanol production In  the  present  study,  we  examined  the  effects  of methanol production process on survival and recovery of M. trichosporium IMV 3011.  The  control  condition were  obtained  by  replacing  CO 2 with  N 2 .  The  total number of cells in a sample were monitored,",

After  serial  dilutions,  samples  were  plated onto agar plates and incubated at 30 °C with an initial atmosphere  of  50%  methane  in  air.  Colonies  were counted after 10 days of incubation.

  "the standard errors of the means were no more than 5%. b Recovery was calculated as (plate count after batch 8/direct count batch 0) × 100. reduction reaction and control was 76% and 80% of the original number of cells, respectively. Recovery on agar plates incubated for 10 days with 76% indicated that a large  fraction  of  the  population  remained  culturable (Table 3).  The  results  presented  here  show  that  CO 2 reduction  can  be  not  detrimental  to  the  viability  of methanotrophs.  However,  Cell  growth  on  plates  was slow,  and  some  colonies  were  visible  only  after  more than 9 days of incubation. Conclusions In  this  paper,  we  found  that  the  catabolism  of  stored Polyβ -Hydroxybutyrate (PHB) can provide intracellular reducing equivalents to improve the intrinsic methanol production  capacity.  Although  the  PHB  production capabilities  of  methanotrophs  have  been  well  documented,  the  concept  of  capitalizing  upon  this  characteristic  for",
  "the  enhancement  of  methanol  production from CO 2 reduction is novel. The  results  shown  that  the  cell  of  methanotrophic bacteria  with  appropriate  PHB  storage  can  long-term catalyze  the  reduction  of  CO 2 ,  in  which  the  origin  of the reducing equivalent is hydrogen from methane. It is  theoretically  possible  that  the  overall  reaction  can obtain  methanol  without  adding  to  the  greenhouse effect.  Also,  it's  an  efficient,  environmentally friendly, renewable process.
