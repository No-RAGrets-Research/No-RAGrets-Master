Ethanol may be present at varying levels within the final product due to the fermentation process, so it is vital to have a validated method to meet regulatory, quality, and safety requirements. Objective: This study describes using water kefir as a matrix for the evaluation of the previously validated method employing headspace gas chromatography mass spectrometry (HS-GCMS)",
  "detection for ethanol in kombucha. The study objective is to demonstrate the method originally using kombucha is also fit for the analysis of water kefir. This method will also evaluate the determination of methanol within the water kefir samples. Method: The matrix extension study was performed as per the AOAC INTERNATIONAL guidance documents outlined in Appendix K: Guidelines for Dietary Supplements and Botanicals using HS-GCMS for ethanol determination. Ethanol determination in each water kefir sample is quantified against an external standard calibration curve. The same instrumentation is used for methanol characterization. Results: RSDr and HorRat values obtained for from the study demonstrated acceptable precision with RSDr values of 1.03 to 6.68% and HorRat values determined to be between 0.23 and 1.52 for ethanol determination within kefir samples. Similarly, acceptable values of RSDr ranging from 1.45 to 3.39% and HorRat ranging from 0.25 to 0.49 were observed with methanol",
  "determination. For methanol determination, the limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) determined for the method in this study to be 16 and 21ppm, respectively. The methanol spike recovery study gave overall recoveries ranging from 89 to 91%, demonstrating acceptable method accuracy. Conclusions: The results of this study demonstrate the previously validated HS-GCMS method for ethanol determination in kombucha can also be used to quantify ethanol in water kefir samples. The method is also suitable for the determination of methanol within water kefir samples. Highlights: A straightforward method has been adapted to include the the quantification of ethanol and methanol in fermented beverages such as Water Kefir samples. V C The Author(s) 2022.

The final beverage can be flavored with fruit, juice, or herbs to make a variety of flavor profiles (1, 2). Water kefir is gaining in popularity as the rise in fermented beverages is increasing due to the potential health benefits associated with intestinal health. Traditionally, kefir grains have been used for the fermentation of",
  "milk products to produce a fermented dairy beverage (3). This style of beverage has been consumed in parts of Asia for thousands of years and was once commonly fermented naturally in different animal offal, such as hide (1, 4). The kefir grains itself are opaque 'beads' that are white in color and consist of a mixture of yeasts and bacteria surrounded by a polysaccharide and protein matrix to give its bead-like texture (4, 5). Kefir grains contain a very diverse and complex mixture of yeasts and bacteria consisting mainly of lactic acid bacteria (LAB), acetic acid bacteria, and yeasts consisting primarily of Saccharomyces, Candida, Kluyveromyces, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus , Leuconostoc , and Acetobacter (5, 6). During the primary fermentation process, sugar, water, and kefir grains are combined into a fermentation vessel and allowed to ferment aerobically for 24-48 h (7). After the primary fermentation process, the kefir grains are removed and other flavorings such as fruit juice,",
  "teas and herbs are added. This process is also known as secondary fermentation and is typically done anaerobically to produce an effervescent type of beverage from the carbon dioxide production. Ethanol, a byproduct of the fermentation process, can be produced as a result, but usually at low levels. As water kefir is marketed as a nonalcoholic beverage and sold in retail grocery stores, it must have an alcohol by volume (ABV) level below < 0.5% in the United States and < 1.1% ABV in Canada to meet the regulatory requirements of each country. As with other fermented beverages, it is important to ensure that ethanol levels within the product meet regulatory and quality standards. Recent lawsuits, media reports, and scientific studies describing inaccurate labeling and ABV levels of ethanol > 0.5% in kombucha products highlights the potential issues and consequences of the failure to properly monitor and assess ethanol production within fermented beverages (8-12). Due to strict regulatory",
  "labeling requirements and the potential public health risk to susceptible populations such as the elderly, young children, and pregnant women, it is imperative to ensure ethanol levels are accurate and true as per the printed label. Previously, a method titled The Determination of Ethanol Content in Kombucha Products Using Headspace Gas Chromatography With Mass Spectrometry Detection was validated as per AOAC INTERNATIONAL guidelines (13). Herein, we report the results of a matrix extension study validating the use of this method to determine ethanol content within water kefir samples. Additionally, this method was further validated to detect the presence of methanol in water kefir beverage samples. Methanol can be naturally found in a variety of food and beverage products and can pose a potential health concern at higher levels. The validation of this method's ability for methanol determination further enhances the utility of this method in the evaluation of the quality and safety of",
  "fermented beverages such as water kefir. This validation method follows AOAC guidelines (14). As part of this study, several water kefir market samples were analyzed, and their ethanol and methanol contents were determined and reported.

  "vial in mg/mL. Single-Laboratory Validation (SLV) Parameters This method was previously validated as per AOAC guidelines for ethanol determination using kombucha as a matrix (13). This matrix extension study was performed to validate the method to include water kefir samples. Both kombucha and water kefir are fermented products and can be considered similar matrixes. The use of HS-GCMS as an analysis method also mitigates many of the issues associated with matrix interferences. Given these conditions, the procedures that were used to evaluate several of the performance characteristics for kombucha in the previous SLV study were considered applicable for the evaluation of these same performance characteristics for kefir water in this study. As such, several of the performance characteristics for ethanol determination had been assessed and established in the previous single-laboratory validation study. A further extension study was performed to validate this method for the determination",
  "of methanol concentration within water kefir samples. (a) Selectivity.The retention times for the peaks corresponding to ethanol, methanol, and propan-1-ol were confirmed through analysis of their respective working check solutions. Identity of the peaks were confirmed through 352 Sy et al.: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol. 106, No. 2, 2023 | comparison of the obtained mass spectrometry spectrums against the NIST database. Chromatograms of water kefir samples were reviewed to ensure there was adequate separation between the analyte peaks and any other peaks observed in the samples. (b) Linearity.The linear response of ethanol over the desired analytical range had already been assessed in the previous kombucha validation study. For the purposes of this study, five-point calibration curves covering the expected analytical range for the samples being analyzed was used. The linear response of methanol was determined through the preparation of nine separate seven-point calibration curves",
  "prepared using the procedure described above. The r 2 values were determined for each calibration curve, and each curve was visually inspected to confirm linearity over the range. An r 2 value > 0.995 was considered acceptable. (c) Method detection level and limit of quantification (LOQ).The limits of detection and quantification for ethanol were determined previously in the kombucha validation study. For methanol, the limit of detection (LOD) was determined through the analysis of seven replicates of water samples containing no methanol. As per the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) recommendations described in the AOAC guidance document, the LOD was defined as the mean response plus three times the standard deviation obtained from analysis of these samples (14). The LOQ for methanol was defined as 10 times the standard deviation that was used to determine the LOD. (d) Accuracy.The accuracy of the ethanol determination for this method had been assessed",
  "previously in the kombucha study. For methanol, the accuracy of the method was assessed using a spike recovery study. The spike recovery study was performed at three levels: 27, 71, and 105 ppm. Water was used as the blank sample matrix. The appropriate amount of methanol was spiked into the blank matrix and then analyzed in quadruplicate as per the described method. The mean recovery was calculated for each spike level and evaluated against AOAC recommended guidelines for acceptable recoveries (14). (e) Precision.Precision for ethanol determination was assessed through the analysis of the obtained market samples. Eight water kefir samples in quadruplicate were prepared and analyzed on each of three separate days, and ABVs of each sample were determined. For methanol, there was a paucity of samples with quantifiable levels of methanol available on the market. As such, data to evaluate precision were obtained from the spiked samples used in the accuracy study. The within-day, between-",
  "day, and total standard deviations of the obtained results were calculated. HorRat values and relative standard deviation (RSDr, %) were determined and used to evaluate the precision of the method. As per SLV guidelines published by AOAC, a HorRat value of < 2.0 was considered acceptable. 'aio Results and Discussion Method Validation Results (a) Selectivity.Ethanol, methanol, and propan-1-ol peaks on the chromatogram were confirmed using their mass spectrums, and all showed adequate separation ( see Figures 1-3 for the chromatograms showing the analysis of standards and water kefir samples). In each respective figure, the chromatograms show peaks for ethanol, propan-1-ol, and methanol and all are clearly separated from all other peaks seen in the sample. (b) Linearity.The linearity for ethanol over the desired range had already been established in the previous kombucha SLV study. The linearity for this analyte was further confirmed through the observation of linear curves and the",
  "calculated r 2 values > 0.999 for all standard curves used for ethanol quantification in this study. For methanol, all calibration curves prepared appeared linear upon visible inspection. The calculated r 2 values of all methanol calibration curves prepared was > 0.999, which demonstrated the linear response of the analyte over the evaluated range. (c) Repeatability and intermediate precision.The intermediate precision for ethanol was determined using quantitative data from the three days of analysis of samples with four replicates to calculate the between-day, within-day, and standard deviations for the method. Intermediate precision values ranged from 1.03 to 6.68% RSDr. Mean ABV values calculated from these samples ranged from 0.14 to 1.70%. ABV and HorRat values were determined to be 0.23-1.52. A summary of these data is shown in Table 1. For methanol determination, RSDr values for all three levels ranged from 1.45 to 3.39% and HorRat values ranged from 0.25 to 0.49. All HorRat",
  "values were determined to be < 2.0, demonstrating acceptable precision is achieved for both analytes with this method. Figure 1.

These levels are within AOAC guidelines for typical acceptable recovery values for these analyte concentrations, demonstrating the method possesses acceptable accuracy for methanol determination",

Conclusions New flavor profiles and the diversity of fruit combinations have made fermented beverages such as water kefir more desirable to a broader consumer base to include young children, adults, and the elderly. With the rise in consumption, it is imperative to ensure that alcohol levels within such products are accurately conveyed to consumers and meet regulatory 354 Sy et al.: Journal of AOAC INTERNATIONAL Vol. 106, No. 2, 2023 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 0.00 | Ethanol Calibration Curve y = 1.5203x - 0.1488 R = 0.9996. .....0 Figure 4.
