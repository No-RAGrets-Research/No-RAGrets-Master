Introduction Methane  is  the  smallest  of  the  hydrocarbon  family  in  its  most reduced form, which means it is packed with potential energy. It is",
  "also a major greenhouse gas (GHG) which is also called a short-term enforcer, i.e. it persists in the atmosphere for shorter duration, as compared to carbon dioxide (CO2) that can stay in atmosphere for thousand years, but its heating effect is much more potent than that of CO2. Thus, even with a shorter lifespan, methane has 28 -34 times higher global warming potential over a period of 100 years than that of CO2  due to its higher solar  radiation  capturing  efficiency  (Priyadarsini  et  al.,  2020).  Every year millions of tonnes of natural gas are flared at the mining sites as preventive measure for global warming due to its global warming potential as discussed above and also because it is considered as waste. As per the International Energy Agency (IEA) and World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership (GGFR) reports of 2021 on flaring emissions, around 143 -144 billion cubic meters of natural gas was wasted by flaring across the globe (GGFR, 2022; IEA, 2022). Also,",
  "capturing the natural gas evolved from mines is difficult and unprofitable due to lack of proper infrastructure and technologies required to make it A B S T R A C T Fast depletion of fossil fuels has triggered research in gas to liquid (GTL) technologies for synthesis of green transportation fuels. Utilization of natural gas pockets located in remote areas for methanol synthesis is a viable GTL  process.  This  study  has  examined  potential  of  microbial  consortium  enriched  from  rice  field  soil  for bioconversion of  methane to methanol. The presence of Type I methanotrophs was confirmed through PCR amplification  of  genomic  DNA  from  soil  using mmoY1 -mmoY2 primer set  which  is  specific  to Methylococcus capsulatus . Further, the methanol production profiling (without MDH inhibitors) revealed ~130 mM (4.16 g/L) methanol production from enriched consortium, which was close to 132.5 mM (4.24 g/L) methanol production by pure strain of Methylococcus capsulatus .  The  yield",
  "of  methanol for enriched consortium was 78.31 % and M. capsulatus was 79.81 %. These results show that enriched consortium holds high potential for BioGTL process for methanol synthesis. consumable for the end-use (Wood et al., 2012). Thus, flaring causes wastage  of  enormous  amount  of  potential  energy  feedstock,  carbon monoxide emission and hazardous black carbon production by incomplete burning (Dong et al., 2017; Gvakharia et al., 2017), not to mention the fire hazards and accidents associated and reported at the oil mining and flaring sites due to human error (Brki ´ c and Praks, 2021; Chen et al., 2022; Mignan et al., 2022). On industrial scale, methane (natural gas) is used as feedstock for production of  various  hydrocarbon  derivatives  using  Fischer-Tropsch process (Dry, 2002; Holditch, 2003; Jones et al., 2022). One of the derivatives is methanol (15.6 MJ/L) which has higher energy density than methane (36.6 × 10 GLYPH<0> 3 MJ/L).  As  a  liquid  fuel,  it  is  much",
  "easier  to handle, easier to blend with gasoline, fits into current infrastructure and can be used as a feedstock for other chemical processes (Bromberg and Cheng,  2010;  Ge  et  al.,  2014a).  Methanol  is  also  produced  using methane by direct methane to methanol (DMTM) technique which is also  a  chemical  process  (Wang  et  al.,  2022b).  Both  Fischer-Tropsch process and DMTM process are chemical routes with very poor selectivity and low yields (Conrado and Gonzalez, 2014) for gas to liquid (GTL)  conversion  which  are  also  energy  intensive,  uneconomic  and * Corresponding author at: Department of Chemical Engineering, Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, Guwahati 781 039, Assam, India.

To address these concerns significant amount of effort has been put into biological gas to liquid (BioGTL) conversion technology that are not energy intensive as the fermentations take place at ambient operating conditions of temperature  and  pressure,  relatively  cost  effective  and  cleaner  for  the environment than chemical routes (Conrado and Gonzalez, 2014; Haynes and Gonzalez, 2014). Biological methane to methanol conversion (bioconversion) is carried out by a set of organisms known as methanotrophs. These methane utilizers capture and metabolize methane as their sole source of carbon and energy for growth and metabolism using metabolic enzymes (Dong et al., 2017; Fei et al., 2014; Ge et al., 2014). More  than  100  g-negative  and  strictly  aerobic  methane-utilizing bacteria  were  isolated  and",
  "classified  by  Whittenbury  et  al.  (1970). They  extensively  described  the  enrichment,  isolation  and  culture methods. These methods have been modified over years and still form the  foundation  for  media  design  for  the  growth  of  methanotrophs. Methanotrophs are a subset of methylotrophic group of bacteria that can utilize  C1  hydrocarbons and their methylated derivatives. The methanotrophs are very specific in substrate requirements and can only grow on C1 hydrocarbons, i.e., methane and methanol (Hanson and Hanson, 1996). Methanotrophs are classified among three phyla such as Proteobacteria, Verrucomicrobia and recently added phylum  NC10 (Hakobyan and Liesack, 2020). The phylum Proteobacteria is the largest among the phyla and is further subdivided into type I, type II and type X subgroups based on their metabolic pathway for carbon assimilation. Type  I  methanotrophs,  also  known  as  gammaproteobacteria,  utilize ribulose monophosphate pathway to assimilate",
  "carbon. Similarly, type II methanotrophs,  or  alphaproteobacteria,  use  serine  cycle  for  carbon fixation. Type X has a combination of both type I and II and can grow in higher temperatures (Colin Murrell and Radajewski, 2000; Hakobyan and Liesack, 2020; Hanson and Hanson, 1996; Whittenbury et al., 1970). Major  sources  of  methanotrophs  include  agricultural  rice  fields, natural gas fields, dairy and cattle industries, etc. They are ubiquitous and are almost present wherever methane exists. India is an agriculturebased country with abundant paddy cultivation. Paddy cultivation is one of the largest sources in the global budget of methane emissions (Wang et al., 2022a). It is interesting to note that majority of methane (90 %) emitted in the wetland rice fields comes from the vascular transport system within the rice plants instead of ebullition or diffusion through the rhizosphere. The rate at which methane is emitted is much less ( < 20 %) than the actual rate of production",
  "in the rice fields. The difference in the  rate  of  production  and  emission  can  be  explained  by  methane oxidation by the methanotrophs present in the oxic regions of the rice roots  and  rhizospheres  (Conrad  and  Rothfuss,  1991).  Thus,  they  are present in abundance in rice fields and they act as the main methane sink where they capture around 20 % of methane evolved due to decaying of water-logged  organic  matter  (Rahalkar  et  al.,  2021).  The  conversion efficiencies  of  transported  methane  by  methanotrophs  remain  in  the range of 70 -95 % in the soil-water interface (Epp and Chanton, 1993; Gilbert  and  Frenzel,  1995).  The  rice  field  rhizosphere  community comprises of type I and type II methanotrophs. However, very few have been successfully cultivated in situ due to various reasons like resistance to growth in laboratory formulated medium, lack of specific nutrient for growth, extremely strict association with heterotrophic satellite community, etc.",
  "(Pandit et al., 2016). In fact, no Type I methanotrophs had been isolated from rice rhizosphere, rice roots, bulk soil or floodwater and  only  their  presence  was  confirmed  using  molecular  techniques (Dianou et al., 2012; Pandit et al., 2016; Takeda et al., 2008). Several methanotrophs  with pmoA lineages  from  rice  paddy  cluster  (e.g., RPC1 -3)  have  been  detected  but  remain  uncultured  till  date  (Knief, 2015; Lüke et al., 2014). Only recently, Type Ia ( Methylomonas, Methylomicrobium,  and  Methylocucumis )  have  been  cultivated  and  isolated (Rahalkar et al., 2021). Methanol production capability of these methanotrophs is yet to be studied. Thus, rice field was chosen for this study since  they  are  a  breaming  source  of  methanotrophs  and  they  are commonly found across India. Methane is a very stable molecule and difficult to dissociate chemically. However, methane to methanol bioconversion is easily catalysed by a family of enzymes called the methane",
  "monooxygenases, i.e. particulate methane monooxygenase (pMMO) and soluble methane monooxygenase  (sMMO),  depending  upon  the  location  of  the  enzymes. Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) is a type X methanotroph that possesses both pMMO and sMMO enzymes (Khider et al., 2021). The presence of extracellular concentration of copper in the growth medium strongly influences the expression of each enzyme. The pMMO enzyme essentially requires copper (both Cu(I) and Cu(II)) for its catalytic activity whereas  sMMO  contains  iron  (Fe).  Thus,  pMMO  is  predominantly expressed when extracellular copper concentration is higher and alternatively, sMMO is expressed when extracellular copper concentration is low (Larsen and Karlsen, 2016; Lieven et al., 2018). The sMMO enzyme complex is made up of protein A, B and C. Protein A, the hydrolase constituent,  is  made  up  of  two  copies  of  three  subunitsα (coded  by mmoX ), β (coded by mmoY ) and γ (coded by mmoZ ). Protein B, coded by mmoB",
  "gene,  is  a  regulatory  protein  that  functions  as  the  effector  of electron transfer during catalytic reaction. Protein C is a reductase coded by mmoC gene (McDonald et al., 1995). The pMMO enzyme has three subunits called pmoA , pmoB and pmoC . Here, the pmoA and pmoC are the transmembrane subunits and pmoB has the soluble region which exhibits methane oxidation activity (Culpepper et al., 2012). In comparison to sMMO, not much has been understood about pMMO yet. Further studies are required to understand the structure, function and mechanism of each subunits and pMMO as a holoenzyme. India has numerous natural gas reserves located in areas of difficult terrain  with  little  or  no  infrastructure  for  transportation  of  gas.  The motivation for this preliminary study was to address the natural gas wastage in remote and diffused sites by developing technology for on spot  utilization  of  natural  gas  pockets.  Several  studies  on  methanol production have been reported",
  "using pure strains (Duan et al., 2011; Ghaz-Jahanian  et  al.,  2018;  Patel  et  al.,  2016a,  2017,  2019,  2020d, 2023; Sahoo et al., 2023). A summary of literature on methanol production using methanotrophic bacteria is presented in Table 1. As can be referred from the table, most of the previous studies have employed single isolated strains of methanotroph for methanol production. However, very few studies have used mixed cultures with methanol titre of 1.49 g/g (Han et al., 2013), 28.13 mM (Sheets et al., 2017) and 15.16 mM (AlSayed et  al.,  2018).  In  addition,  no  previous  study  has  used methanotrophic consortium enriched specifically from rice field soil for methanol  production.  Although  the  basic  concept  of  conversion  of methane to methanol has been previously reported in literature, several practical constraints and hurdles have to be overcome to convert the basic  concept  into  a  viable  solution.  One  major  hurdle  is  the  use  of natural isolates (such",
  "as consortia enriched from natural source of rice fields) which are robust and stable for large scale operation. The main objectives of this preliminary study include (i) detection and enrichment of methanotrophic bacteria from rice field soil community, (ii) methanol production using enriched microbial consortium. As  already  discussed,  rice  fields  are  a  substantial  source  of  massive methanotrophic communities. Unfortunately, not all the bacterial species are culturable. So, early and easy detection tools can help in understanding,  strategizing  and  refining  the  enrichment  and  isolation process. Significant levels of methanol production have been observed in this preliminary study, as described in subsequent sections. 2. Materials and methods 2.1.

Collection of environmental samples and procurement of pure strains The  soil  samples  were  collected  from  upper  10-cm  soil  layer (essentially the rhizosphere) in sterile 50 mL falcon tubes from a rice field in Bongaigaon district of Assam. The samples were stored in 4 ◦ C until further experiments. The pure strains of Methylococcus capsulatus (ATCC 33009) were obtained from ATCC (USA), while strains of Methylomicrobium buryatense were gifted by Prof. Mary Lidstrom, University of Washington, USA. 2.3. Enrichment of rice field soil cultures 2.4. Genomic DNA extraction and gene detection 2.4.1. DNA extraction 300 mg of the rice field soil was weighed and used for the genomic DNA extraction without dilution in duplicate. The extraction was done using",
  "soil DNA extraction kit (MP Biomedicals) method which allows genomic DNA extraction by feeding methanotroph rich rice field soil directly into the lysis column. The extracted genomic DNA were resolved in 1 % agarose gel in TBE buffer using ethidium bromide for imaging alongside 1Kb DNA ladder from New England Biolabs (NEB). 2.4.2. Gene detection The gene detection was done through PCR amplification in a thermal cycler  (Applied  Biosystems)  using  the  primers  mentioned  in  Table  2 (McDonald et al., 1995; Miguez et al., 1997; Narihiro and Sekiguchi, 2011). The PCR amplification was performed in 0.5 mL flat cap PCR tubes. The total volume of PCR mix was 50 μ L containing 5 μ L genomic DNA template, 4 μ L forward and reverse primer each, 25 μ L master mix (MP Biomedicals) and 12μ L nuclease-free water. 2.4.3. PCR program The PCR program started with initial denaturation at 95 ◦ C for 5 min. Then, the program cycled through 94 ◦ C for 30 s, 54 ◦ C for 45 s and 72 ◦ C for 60 s for 35",
  "cycles. The final amplification step was carried out at 72 ◦ C for 10 min. The amplified products were stained with ethidium bromide and imaged in a 1 % horizontal agarose electrophoresis gel with TBE buffer at 80 mA for 30 min. The  enrichment  was  done  in  20  mL  of  NMS  medium  in  120  mL airtight serum flasks using extinction dilution technique. The soil samples were diluted in distilled water (1 g in 10 mL) and seeded in nitrate mineral salt medium (NMS) composed of MgSO4 ⋅ 7H2O (1.0 g/L), KNO3 (1.0  g/L),  KH2PO4 (0.272  g/L),  Na2HPO4 (0.284  g/L),  CaCl2 ⋅ 2H2O (0.134 g/L), chelated Fe solution (0.2 % v /v), and a trace element solution (0.05 % v/v) (Sheets et al., 2016). 1 mL of the diluted environmental sample was inoculated in fresh NMS medium (pH 6.8) and the bottles were sealed under pressure with equimolar mixture of methane and air (1:1) in the headspace. The cultures were then incubated at 30 ◦ C and 200 rpm for 5 days to produce a mixed culture. After 5 days, 1 mL",
  "from the mixed culture was inoculated into fresh sterile NMS medium in triplicate and incubated for 3 days with methane as before. Every third day, the enriched culture was successively transferred to fresh sterile NMS medium and fed with equimolar methane and air mixture (1:1). This process was repeated for 30 days. 2.5. Methanol accumulation The pure strains of Methylococcus capsulatus and Methylomicrobium buryatense and  the  isolated  consortium  from  rice  field  sample  were grown in 20 mL NMS medium (120 mL serum vials) at pH 6.8 and pH 9 in batch mode. The cultures were sealed, injected under pressure with equimolar methane and air mixture (1:1) in the headspace, and incubated at 30 ◦ C at 200 rpm. Due to small volume of the vials (120 mL) we couldn't  measure  the  pressure  of  the  headspace  gas.  However,  the methane  and  air  mixture  was  injected  using  a  sterile  syringe  under pressure and we expect the approximate headspace pressure to be between 1.5 and 1.8",
  "atm. The methanol production was estimated using methanol standards through gas chromatography analysis in GC Clarus 590 (Perkin Elmer). The cultures were grown for 5 days and 1 mL of culture was centrifuged at 10000 rpm ( ≈ 11,170 g) for 10 mins. The supernatant was collected. The samples were filtered through 0.2 μ m syringe  filters  and  prepared  for  methanol  estimation  through  GC analysis.

The temperature of injector and detector were 110 ◦ C and 250 ◦ C, respectively. The initial oven temperature was 40 ◦ C with a hold time of 3 min, which increased to 100 ◦ C with a hold time of 5 min at 5 ◦ C/min ramp",
  "rate, and finally the temperature increased to 200 ◦ C with a hold time of 3 min at 5 ◦ C/min ramp rate. Nitrogen gas was used as carrier at 2 mL/min flow rate and split ratio 20:1. Air and hydrogen were fed at 450 mL/min and 45 mL/min, respectively. The final  quantity  of  methanol  produced  was  measured  using  the  slope equation from the calibration curve obtained using the peak area of various  methanol  standards  plotted  against  corresponding  methanol concentrations. 3. Results 3.1. Preamble: enrichment of rice field soil cultures Isolation  of  methanotrophic  bacteria  is  a  time-consuming  and tedious process. The methanotrophs are strongly associated with heterotrophic  satellites  around  them  in  their  community  (Dedysh  and Dunfield, 2011). So, the initial growth is often attributed to the growth of satellite bacteria growing on products from methanotrophic bacteria. The bacterial growth was observed in the enrichment cultures after 3 days which could be",
  "identified by increase in the turbidity of the cultures. Since, the growth was also observed in control experiments within 3 days, which were not fed with methane, it can be inferred that initial growth attributes to the heterotrophic community and not the methanotrophs.  However, methanotrophic bacteria have been reported to grow in 4 -5 days from inoculation. Pure cultures are isolated bacteria that help in study of single species. In contrast, use of enriched culture has  economic  and  practical  advantage  over  pure  cultures.  Microbial consortium has more tolerance to potential contaminants in the feed gas (Jiang et al., 2023). So, the cost associated with the purification of feed gas  for  fermentation  can  be  significantly  reduced.  This  shows  that methanotrophic bacteria has better adaptability and applicability  towards changing environment while growing in a community (Han et al., 2013). Moreover, isolation of pure strains needs longer incubation time period and",
  "multiple transfers rendering the entire process not only unreliable and extremely challenging but also time consuming; further, it requires expertise to avoid contaminations in between  transfers (Kulkarni et al., 2022). On the contrary, consortial cultures are reliable, easier to culture and have above mentioned advantages over pure cultures  in  fermentations.  The  use  of  enriched  mixed  cultures  (AlSayed et al., 2018) and co-cultures (Patel et al., 2018b) have also been previously  reported  for  methanol  production  with  end  concentrations  of 15.16 and 9.65 mM, respectively, but the source was mostly activated sludge.  So,  in  this  preliminary  study  the  approach  was  focused  on enriched consortium from rice field soil for methanol production. 3.2. Genomic DNA extraction and gene detection PCR amplification of target gene sequences is an easy tool for direct detection  of  microorganisms  in  environmental  samples.  This  tool  is extremely useful especially when",
  "the microorganisms in the samples are difficult to culture in laboratory for studies (as discussed in previous sections). The best genomic DNA extracted yielded 63.7 ng of DNA/ μ L with 260/280 ratio of 1.61 among the duplicate isolations from 300 mg rice field soil. This DNA was stained with ethidium bromide and run in 1 % agarose gel alongside of 1 KB ladder. The genomic DNA was used as a template  and  checked  for  the  presence  of  soluble  methane  monooxygenase genes. The presence of methanogenic community was also examined  in  the  rice  field  soil  samples  using  the met86f/met1340r primers for the 16S rRNA for most methanogens. In  Fig.  1,  lane  6 -9  also  show  amplification,  although  low  but detectable levels, indicating the presence various methanotrophic bacteria. This implies that the rice field methanotrophic community harbours a diverse group of methanotrophs. The mmoY1 -mmoY2 primer set (Lane 4) is derived from the β subunit of hydrolase protein A and is",
  "specific for the mmoY gene from M. capsulatus (Miguez et al., 1997). From Fig. 1 (b), it can be observed that maximum amplification has been obtained in Lane 4. From this result, the presence of either M. capsulatus or M. capsulatus -like methanotrophs in the original rice field soil community  is  confirmed.  As  expected,  slight  amplification  can  also  be observed in Lane 5 representing the methane producing community in the rice field soil sample. 3.3. Methanol production The methanol production by the enriched rice field consortium and the pure strains of M. capsulatus and M. buryatense in 5 days (or 120 h) of incubation at pH levels of 6.8 and 9 are shown in Fig. 2.

This could be attributed to its origin of soda lake samples (Fei et al., 2018; Groom and Lidstrom, 2021; Kaluzhnaya et al., 2001). The M. capsulatus was grown in slightly acidic pH of 6.8 (Yu et al., 2003). The rice field soil consortium was grown in both the pH. There was no methanol production in rice field soil samples grown in pH 9. However, the methanol productivity in rice field sample",
  "(0.832 g/L d GLYPH<0> 1 ) grown in pH 6.8 was similar to that in M. capsulatus (0.848 g/L d GLYPH<0> 1 ). Most notably, the maximum methanol production by rice field consortium was 130 mM (4.16 g/L), which was at par with the methanol production by M. capsulatus (132.5 mM or 4.24 g/L) and by M. buryatense (160 mM or 5.12 g/L). To the best of our knowledge, these values  are  the  highest  among  literature  on  methanol  production  by methanotrophs. 3.4. Determination of methanol yield As mentioned earlier, headspace pressure was approximately in the range of 1.5 to 1.8 atm. The moles of headspace gas (equimolar mixture of air and methane) can be calculated using ideal gas equation: PV = nRT. Considering an average pressure of 1.65 atm, V = 100 mL, R = 0.08206 L atm K GLYPH<0> 1  mol GLYPH<0> 1 , T = 303 K, the total number of gas moles (n) in the headspace are 6.64 mmoles, half which accounts for methane. Considering the metabolic stoichiometry of 1 mol of methanol per mol of",
  "methane,  the  total  percentage  consumption  of  methane  (or  in  other words methanol yield per mole of methane) is: 2.6/3.32 = 0.783 or 78.3 %. 4. Discussion Methanotrophs efficiently convert methane to methanol in a single step using methane monooxygenase enzymes at ambient reaction conditions.  The  production  of  methanol  occurs  intracellularly  by  both pMMO  and  sMMO.  Extracellular  methanol  accumulation  is  usually achieved by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibition (Patel et al., 2016c).  In  this  study,  methanol  production  was  achieved  without addition of MDH inhibitors. The samples from initial culture and fifth day  enriched  cultures  were  taken  and  examined  for  the  presence  of methanol using gas chromatography. The methanol production in the pure strains of M. capsulatus and M. buryatense were also examined after 5 days of incubation (Fig. 2). It is very interesting to note here that these results are consistent with the gene detection results. The",
  "presence of bacteria in rice field soil similar to M. capsulatus (confirmed by PCR gene amplification) shows similar methanol production as well. The maximum methanol production reported in previous literature was 50 mM (1.6 g/L) by Strain AS1 isolated from active anaerobic sludge grown under 50 % methane at 28 ◦ C in an external loop airlift bioreactor where the airlift reactor was constantly supplied with methane enriched NMS medium  (Ghaz-Jahanian  et  al.,  2018).  Recently,  a  methanol  titre  of 61.88  mM  was  achieved  a  customized  airlift  with  a  draft  tube  and microsparger  using Methylosinus  trichosporium NCIMB  11131.  The design of the bioreactor and use of methane vector enhanced the volumetric mass transfer rate of methane resulting in a high methanol titre (Sahoo et al., 2023). The highest methanol titre reported so far is 64.6 mM that has been achieved by using co-culture of Metholosinus sporium and Methylocystis bryophila and a feed gas composition of methane",
  "(30 %) and hydrogen (5 -20 %) that was derived from anaerobic digestion and dark fermentation of rice straw (Patel et al., 2023). Table 1 compares our results with previous literature. 5. Conclusions Here, we have shown that the use of enriched cultures from rice field soil in place of pure cultures ( M. buryatense and M. capsulatus ) can also produce similar quantities (130 mM, 160 mM and 132.5 mM, respectively) of methanol. An added advantage of microbial cultures enriched from natural resources is that they are highly stable and robust against environmental variations,  which  makes  them  most  suitable  for  large scale operations. This study, thus, opens up a spectrum of new possibilities for methanol production from an economically friendly route of BioGTL process and also provide a possible solution for effective on-spot utilization of isolated natural gas pockets.
