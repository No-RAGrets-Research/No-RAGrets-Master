The optimal conditions  for cell growth and production  o f   the soluble form o f   MMO (sMMO) were determined from  batch  cultivations o f   an  obligatory  methanotroph, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b,  in  shake flasks and  a 5-L bioreactor.

In  the bioreactor experiments, external  CO,  addition eliminated the long lag  period  observed in the absence o f   added CuS04,  i.e., prior to the exponential cell  growth phase. When  methane was continuously supplied, the profile  o f   the cell  growth showed two different phases depending on the availability of nitrate, an initial fast exponential  growth  phase  (specific growth  rate, p = 0.08  h-')  and  a  later  slow growth phase ( p = 0.008  h-'). The cell  density  at  the  transition from  a  fast to  a  slow growth rate was proportional to the initial  medium  nitrate concentration in the range 5-20  mM and cell yield was estimated to be 7.14 g dry cell wt/g N. Whole-cell sMMO activity  remained  essentially constant regardless o f   the growth rate until  cell  growth stopped. With  an  initial medium  iron concentration below 40  mM, an abrupt decrease in sMMO activity was observed. The lowered  sMMO activity could be restored by supplying  additional",

They are potentially useful in the  bioremediation  of  polluted  environments,  since they  can  effectively degrade a  number  of  chlorinated hydrocarbon~.~~\",~~~~~ Another potentially important application of  methanotrophs is the production of  methanoI2' and  various  alkene  ep~xides.\",'~ Methanol  has * Present address: Biomedical Sciences Division, Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory, University of California, Livermore, CA 94550 ' Chemical  Sciences  Division,  Lawrence  Livermore  National Laboratory, University of California, Livermore, CA 94550 * To whom all correspondence should be addressed. attractive  possible  large-scale",
  "uses  as  an  alternative cleaner-burning fuel and as a feedstock for the synthesis of  the gasoline octane booster, methyl tertiarybutyl ether.2,24'29 Among the alkene epoxides, propene oxide has  an important commercial value  and, furthermore, the biocatalyzed conversion of  propene to propene oxide is of  interest to study as a model gas-solid bioreactor system.12 The foregoing  potential  applications  of  methanotrophs  are  attributed  to the presence  of  their  rather non-specific enzymes called methane monooxygenases (MMOs). In some methanotrophs such as Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b  and Methylococcus  capsulatus (Bath), the  MMO  enzyme  is  known  to be  associated with either a membrane-bound (particulate) fraction or as  a  cytoplasmic (soluble) protein  complex, depending on the growth  condition^.^^^^'^^ While the soluble MMO (sMMO) enzyme system has been purified and studied in  some  detail  during  the  past  five   year^,^^\"^,^^  the growth  characteristics  of",
  "microorganisms  producing this enzyme have not been investigated and discussed in much detail. Harwood and Pirt examined the growth of M. capsulatus (Bath) and provided some basic information which is helpful in assessing the economic feasibility of  producing microbial protein from natural gas.13 They studied  the  effects  of  nutrient  composition and several operational conditions, but did not address the production of  MMO. The effect of  oxygen tension on methylotrophic  bacteria  was  examined  by  Dalton's gro~p~','~ and  Maclennan  et  a1.20. In M. capsulatus (Bath), Dalton  et  al. noted that  a high  oxygen tension above a pOz of  0.1  atm inhibited  nitrogen assimilation and reduced the growth rate under nitrate- or ammonium-limiting conditions. Maclennan et al. observed that increasing the oxygen 'ension  decreased the cell yield, but it increased C02 production during the continuous culturing of Pseudomonas AM1 on methanol. Establishment of  the precise culture conditions",
  "governing the  intracellular  location or form of  the MMO enzyme has  been  a  conflicting,  but  important  issue. Scott et aL3' reported that M. trichosporium OB3b generated  the  particulate  form of  MMO  (pMMO) during oxygen-limited,  nitrate-excess  chemostat  culturing. However, Dalton's group reported  that  the enzyme lo- Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Vol.  38,  Pp. 423-433 (1991) 0 1991 John Wiley & Sons, Inc.

More recently, Higgin's group also demonstrated the role of  copper  in  regulating the intracellular  location of  MMO in M. trichosporium OB3b,",
  "but they did not clarify the effects of  the nutrients that they previously proposed to be responsible for determining its location and form.',* This article deals with optimizing the culture conditions  for  the  growth  of  M . trichosporium OB3b and the simultaneous  production  of  sMMO  activity.  The parameters  considered  include  pH,  temperature,  and the concentrations of some key culture medium components such as copper, phosphate, nitrate, and iron. The intracellular location of  the MMO enzymes was monitored  carefully,  since  defining  the  culture  conditions which would lead to the exclusive formation of  sMMO was  desired.  Experiments were  also performed  in  an attempt to increase the final biomass density. MATERIALS AND METHODS Microorganism and Culture Conditions Methylosinus  trichosporium OB3b  obtained  from Professor R. S. Hanson (Gray Freshwater Biological Institute, University of  Minnesota) was used in all experiments.  It  was  maintained  on  1.7%  agar",
  "plates  of Higgins  nitrate  minimal  salt  medium6 at  30°C  (see Table I). The agar plates were cultured and stored several weeks in a gas-tight  jar under a 1 : 1  (v/v) methane/air gas mixture. For long term storage, glycerol was added at  20%  (w/v)  to  the  fully  grown  shake-flask  cultures and the mixture was maintained at  -60°C. The basal culture medium used for both the shakeflask and the bioreactor experiments was the same nitrate  minimal  salt  medium  cited  above, but  it  lacked CuS04. It  was  prepared  from  four  separate  concentrated  stock solutions  as  described  in  Table  I,  except that CuS04  was deleted from solution 3. Cellulose acetate (0.22 pm) membranes, 50-mm-diameter disposable filter unit from Corning Glass Works (Corning NY) or a  142-mm-diameter 316  stainless-steel filter  apparatus from Millipore Corp., were used for sterilizing all of the liquid solutions. For the bioreactor experiments which involved the continuous supply of  an air/C02  gas",
  "mixture (see below), the fully constituted  culture medium was sparged and saturated with this gas mixture for at least  6 h  (along with  automatic pH adjustment to 7.0) prior to the inoculations. Flask  experiments  were  performed  at  30°C  (unless stated otherwise) in  a gyratory incubator (model G24, New Brunswick Scientific Co., New Brunswick, NJ) at Table  I. Composition  and  concentration of  stock  solutions  f y Higgins nitrate minimal salt medium.\" a Culture medium was made up as follows: Appropriate aliquots of concentrated solutions 1-3  were added to the desired volume of double distilled water and the combined diluted mixture was sterilized by passage through a 0.22-pm membrane filter. Separate and freshly prepared sterile iron solution 4 was then added aseptically to  this  mixture.  Higgins  standard nitrate  minimal medium contains Cu at a final concentration of  1.0 pM. Each stock solution was stored at 4°C after sterilization, except for the phosphate buffer which",
  "was stored at room temperature. a shaking speed of 300 rpm. Shake flasks (300 mL) having a 19-mm (0.d.) sidearm tube (Wheaton Instruments) were employed to read the absorbance directly without removing samples during  the  cultivation.  The  liquid working volume was 20 mL. The small screw cap opening on the flask was used for introducing the methane/ air  mixture.  It  was  sealed  with  an  open-top-closure screw cap and a PTFE-faced red rubber septum (Kimble Glass Inc.). The large opening on the flask was used for  adding culture  medium  and  the  inoculum.  It  was plugged with a sponge stopper during autoclaving, but was subsequently sealed tightly during  the  cultivation with  the  rubber-lined  plastic  screw cap that was  supplied with the flask. Before starting a new flask incubation,  a  1 : 1 (v/v)  methane/air  gas mixture was bubbled into the inoculated culture medium for 5 min at a flow rate of  270 mL/min.  It was added through a sterile intraveneous placement unit",
  "consisting of  a needle and a long catheter (Delmed, Inc., New Brunswick, NJ). The methane  and  air  were  measured  and  mixed  with  a Matheson gas proportioner (model 7300, Matheson Gas Products, Syracuse, NJ) and sterilized through a 0.22pm disposable filter unit (Corning Glass Works) before the gas mixture passed into the flasks. Generally, during flask culturing the gas phase was either not replenished or else it was replaced one time after 48 h. When 424 BIOTECHNOLOGY AND BIOENGINEERING, VOL. 38, NO. 4 ,   AUGUST 5,  1991 a longer growth period was desired, it was replenished every 24 h. Fermentor-scale  experiments were  performed  in  a 5-L bioreactor  (Bioflo  11,  New  Brunswick  Scientific Co.) with  a continuous flow of  gases. The  incubation temperature was  30°C and  the  pH was maintained  at 6.8-7.2 through  the  automatic addition of  2N NaOH. Dissolved oxygen (DO)  levels were kept above 10% saturation in most cases by controlling the agitation speed (350-700  rpm)",
  "and the gas flow rates:  150-500  mL/h for methane  and 450-1500 mL/h  for air or  10% COzcontaining  air.  They  were  regulated  with  Matheson mass flowmeters (model 8111) and high accuracy valves (Series 4170). Analytical Methods Cell Densities and Nitrate Concentration Cell  densities were  determined  by  measuring the  absorbance at 660 nm ( A 6 6 0 ) in three spectrophotometers, two Spectronic model 21s (Milton-Roy Inc.) and a Gilford  model  260  (Gilford Instrument  Laboratory, Inc.). Sidearm shake-culture flasks were read in a Spectronic 21  that was  equipped with  a universal cuvette holder. The cell densities in the bioreactor  were monitored continuously by  pumping  the  culture  broth  into  a  flowthrough  cell  (glass tube,  outside  diameter  of  10 mm) positioned in a separate Spectronic 21 which was connected to a chart recorder (BD 40, Kipp & Zonen, Holland). The  conversion factors from  the  sidearm flask Spectronic 21 readings and the bioreactor flow-through",
  "cell Spectronic 21 readings to the  Gilford 260  (10-mm cuvette) readings were  1.5 and  4.0,  respectively.  One unit  of Ah60 in the Spectronic 21 (sidearm flask) corresponded to 0.41 mg dry cell wt/mL;  for the Gilford 260 (cuvette) it  represented 0.27 mg  dry cell wt/mL,  based on a linear dry weight curve over an extended range of absorbances. -Periodically, serial-dilution platings  on 1.7% agar-Higgins medium were performed to validate that  the  shake-flask and bioreactor A660 readings were indeed representitive of  cell densities. Nitrate  concentration was  determined  with  an  ionspecific nitrate  electrode  (Orion,  model  93-07) and  a double-junction reference electrode (Orion, model 9002) connected to a pH/ion  meter (model 701A, Orion Research Instruments). It  was  possible to measure nitrate  concentrations  as  low  as  0.01  mM without  any pretreatment of  the culture medium. MMO Activity in Intact Washed Cell Suspensions Microorganisms were  harvested  by",
  "centrifugation  at room  temperature  in  an  Eppendorf  microcentrifuge (model 5413, Brinkmann Instruments, Inc.) at  104g  for 2 min. The cell pellets were washed once with buffer [25 mM 3-N-morpholino)-propanesulfonic acid (MOPS), pH 7.0,  plus 5 mM MgCl2], resuspended in the same buffer to give a cell density of  ca. 5.0 mg  dry wt/mL, and placed on ice. Enzyme assays were performed immediately after sampling, usually within 30 min. Total whole-cell MMO (soluble plus particulate) activity was determined routinely by measuring  the epoxidation  rate  o f   p r ~ p e n e . ' ~ The presence  of  sMMO in intact cells  was assessed  by measuring the disappearance rate of  chloroform. Chloroform oxidation is a catalytic activity of  the soluble, but not the particulate  form of M. trichosporiurn OB3b MM0.32  MMO  assay incubations were  carried  out  in  5-mL clear (for propene) or 5-mL amber  (for chloroform which  is  light-sensitive) vials sealed with  open-top-closure screw caps and",
  "PTFE-faced rubber septa; the PTFE facings of  the septa were placed downward toward the gas phase within the vials. The reaction mixtures contained in a total liquid volume of  0.5  mL:  0.1-0.5 mg  equivalents of  dry cell mass (0.3-1.5 mg  of  protein in  the case of  broken cell fractions); 12.5 pmol  MOPS buffer, pH 7.0;  2.5  pmol MgC12; and  10  pmol  sodium  formate.  Propene  gas (44.6 pmol) was injected into the headspace of  the vial. The alternate  sMMO-specific  substrate,  chloroform (0.5-1.0  pmol), was incorporated into the 0.5 mL liquid volume. Reactions were initiated by placing the vials in a reciprocal water bath shaker (30\"C, 180 rpm). Liquid samples of  3 pL (for propene  activity) or gas  samples of  30  p L  (for  chloroform  activity)  were  analyzed  at 3-5  min intervals over a total time period of  10-30  min with a gas chromatograph fitted with a flame ionization detector  (Hach, Carle  Chromatography  Series  100, Hach  Co.).  A  6-ft  stainless-steel",
  "column  (outside diameter of  1/8 in.), packed with 0.1% S P l O O O  on Carbopack  C, S O / l O O   mesh, was  used  for  both  the  propene and the chloroform substrate assays. The column temperature  was  85°C for  propene  and  130°C for  chloroform. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of  20 mL/min. MMO Activity in the Cell-Free Systems Cells from shake flasks were harvested by  centrifugation (104g,  10 min, 4\"C),  washed once in ice-cold 25 mM MOPS  buffer,  pH  7.0,  containing  5  mM MgC12, and resuspended in the same buffer to give ca. 25 mg  dry cell  wt/mL.  Bovine  pancreas  deoxyribonuclease  I (Sigma Chemical Co.) was added to give a concentration of  10 pg/mL.  Cells in suspension at 4°C were then broken by  a single pass through a French pressure cell (SLM Instruments,  Inc.,  IL) at  15,000 lb/in.' and  the unbroken cells were removed by  centrifugation at  104g for  10 in, 4°C. The resulting cell-free extract was further centrifuged two successive times",
  "at 3.8 x 104g  for 30 min, yielding a supernatant (S38) and an initialparticulate  (P38 combined sediment) fraction. In order to remove  probable  contamination  from  entrapped  S38, the initial  P38 fraction was washed, recentrifuged one additional time in the same cold buffer, and again resuspended to  give  the  final  P38  membrane material. PARK ET AL.: BATCH PRODUCTION Of sMMO 425 most constant throughout  the cultivation, except for a decreasing trend near the end of  the batch operation. It is worth noting that there was no appreciable change in sMMO activity at around 50-60 h, i.e., before and after the large shift in the growth rate. Under these culture conditions  the  level  of  sMMO  catalysis  and,  presumably, the rate of methane assimilation are not proportional  to  the  bacterial  growth  rate.  A  biphasic growth curve and the nonvarying sMMO activity have not  been  addressed in  the past,  but  they  may  explain why  the reported  values for the methane",
  "consumption efficiency (defined as g dry cell wt produced/g methane consumed) of M. trichosporiurn OB3b and several other methanotrophs  are  not  consistent  and  vary  widely.'*16 Figure 5 also shows that the decrease of the growth rate coincided with the depletion of  culture medium nitrate at 50-60 h.  This  indicated  that  the  transition  might be induced by a switch of  the nitrogen source from nitrate  to  the  gaseous nitrogen  that  is  carried  into  the bioreactor as part  of  the 9:l air/C02  mixture.  It  has been  established that M. trichosporium OB3b can  fix gaseous nitrogen  through  a  nitrogenase  which  is  inducible  under  either  nitrate-  or  ammonium-limiting culture conditions.394 The effect of  nitrate on the cell growth and the transition in the growth rate was investigated further: first, by  varying its  concentration  in  the bioreactor  culture medium,  and  next,  by  transferring  bioreactor  cells growing in two different growth phases into fresh",
  "culture  media.  Figure 6 shows the cell  densities  both at  the  transitions (X,) and  at  the  ends  of  the  batch cultures as a function of the initial medium nitrate concentration. Parameter X, was determined by extrapolating the straight lines during both growth phases. When the  nitrate  concentration  was  varied  over  the  range from 5 to 20 mM, X, increased with  increasing nitrate although the  final  cell  densities were  practically constant.  Cell  yield  on  nitrate  was  determined  from  the slope in Figure 6 to be 100 g dry cell wt/mol  nitrate or 7.14 g dry cell wt/g  N. It is in close agreement with the theoretical value estimated from elemental analyses of various methanotrophs.'  At a much higher nitrate concentration (40 mM), however,  the  exponential  fast growth rate began to decrease well before most of  the nitrate was consumed and the proportionality shown in Figure 6 did not extent to this higher nitrate concentration (data not shown). Figure 7 shows the",
  "results of the culture transfer  experiments.  Microorganisms growing in the bioreactor  were transferred at two separate times into shake flasks containing fresh media with either no added  nitrate  or  10  m M  nitrate.  When  fast  growing early  stage bioreactor  cells were  transferred  into  the fresh nitrate-containing medium at 20 h, they exhibited the same rapid growth rate. Similarly, when slow growing late-stage bioreactor cells were transferred at 150 h, nitrate quickly restored most of  their earlier fast growth rate.

Effect of  Temperature  and pH The effect  of  temperature  on cell growth  and  sMMO activity was examined (Fig. 2).

In the pH 6.0-7.0 region, there was essentially no difference in growth rate. But above pH 7.5, an increased lag  time was observed  and  the growth  rate  decreased with increasing pH.

This  higher propene  oxidative activity is due to the production of  pMMO, not  an elevated production of  sMMO,",
  "because cells grown on 100 mM or higher phosphate  do  not  display  any  detectable activity with chloroform (Fig. 3). This observation raised  an interesting question concerning the role of  phosphate in regulating the form of MMO, namely whether the shift in enzyme location is due to a high phosphate concentration per se or due to Cu contaminants  present  in  the  Na/K  salts  that  are used  in  preparing  high  phosphate  culture  medium. Another shake flask experiment combined with culture medium  Cu  analyses,  therefore,  was  conducted  to answer this question. With 100 mM phosphate, it was observed that propene oxidative activity was high (ca. 200 nmol/mg  dry  cell  wt  min)  at  a  low  cell  density (A 6 6 0 = 0.28), but it declined to 95 nmol/mg dry cell wt min when the A6 6 0 reached 0.6.  Correspondingly, chloroform oxidative activity was  not  detected  at  the  low cell  density, but  it  appeared (22 nmol/mg  dry  cell wt min) at the higher cell density when the",
  "propene activity declined. Moreover, inductive coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) analyses revealed that  the  Cu concentration was ca. 0.2 p M for 100 mM phosphate medium compared to only 0.02 p M for 10 mM phosphate medium. Collectively, these results strongly suggest that  the production of  pMMO in Figure 3 at high phosphate concentrations is due to traces of  carry-over Cu contamination in the Na/K salts. Bioreactor Experiments Much higher cell densities can be obtained in a bioreactor  in  which  the  gaseous  substrates  are  continuously supplied.

The maximum specific growth rates during the exponential  growth  phase,  however,  remained  approximately the  same (pmax = 0.065-0.090 h-'). According to the serine pathway by which M. trichosporiurn OB3b is  known to utilize formaldehyde for cell mass generation, one molecule of  COz  is needed per two molecules of  formaldehyde  assimilated  to  convert  phosphoenol pyruvate to oxaloacetate and to keep the cycle continuously operating.' Without an external supplementation, the initial COz  level in the culture medium must be",
  "too low  to  support  immediate  rapid  cell  growth.  This  is probably exacerbated in  a bioreactor because the continuous sparging with an aidmethane gas mixture  initially  strips  off  the  small  amounts  of  COz produced from methane metabolism. As  the  cell density slowly increases, the  medium  COz concentration  apparently rises and finally becomes sufficient to support a maximal cell growth rate  as indicated by  the  similar logarithmic  slopes in  Figure 4. Based on these  results, all subsequent  experiments  in  the  bioreactor  were  conducted with 10% COz-containing air. Effect of Nitrate and Diauxic Growth Figure 5 shows batch  profiles  of  cell  growth,  nitrate concentration,  DO level,  and sMMO activity.  Exponential cell growth was associated with a large drop in the DO level.

  "0.008 h-'  was observed and this slow rate continued for approximately a week before  the  cell  growth  completely stopped.  The  final cell density reached was about 2.5 g dry cell wt/L.  The whole-cell sMMO activity was  routinely  assayed both with and without formate added as an oxidizable agent to regenerate intracellular NADH levels.

It is worth noting that there was no appreciable change in sMMO activity at around 50-60 h, i.e., before and after the large shift in the growth rate. Under these culture conditions  the level  of  sMMO  catalysis  and, presumably, the rate of  methane assimilation are not proportional  to  the  bacterial  growth  rate.  A  biphasic growth curve and the nonvarying sMMO activity have not  been  addressed in  the past,  but  they  may  explain why the reported values for the methane consumption efficiency (defined as g dry cell wt produced/g methane consumed) of M. trichosporium OB3b and several other methanotrophs  are",
  "not  consistent  and  vary  widely.'*'6 Figure 5 also shows that the decrease of the growth rate coincided with the depletion of  culture medium nitrate at  50-60 h.  This  indicated  that  the  transition  might be induced by  a switch of  the nitrogen source from nitrate  to the  gaseous nitrogen  that  is  carried  into  the bioreactor as  part  of  the 9:l air/C02 mixture.  It  has been  established that M. trichosporiurn OB3b can fix gaseous  nitrogen  through  a  nitrogenase  which  is  inducible  under  either  nitrate-  or  ammonium-limiting culture  condition^.^,^ The effect of  nitrate on the cell growth and the transition in the growth rate was investigated further: first, by  varying  its  concentration  in  the  bioreactor culture medium,  and  next,  by  transferring  bioreactor  cells growing in two different growth phases into fresh culture  media.  Figure  6  shows  the  cell  densities  both at  the  transitions ( X , ) and  at  the  ends  of  the  batch cultures as a",
  "function of the initial medium nitrate concentration. Parameter X, was determined by extrapolating the straight lines during both growth phases. When the nitrate  concentration  was varied  over  the  range from 5 to 20 mM, X, increased with increasing nitrate although  the  final  cell  densities were  practically constant.  Cell  yield  on  nitrate  was  determined  from  the slope in Figure 6 to be  1 0 0  g dry cell wt/mol  nitrate or 7.14 g dry cell wt/g N. It is in close agreement with the theoretical value estimated from elemental analyses of various methanotrophs.'  At a much higher nitrate concentration (40 mM), however,  the  exponential  fast growth rate began to decrease well before most of  the nitrate was consumed and the proportionality shown in Figure 6 did not extent to this higher nitrate concentration (data not shown). Figure 7 shows the results of  the culture transfer  experiments. Microorganisms growing in the bioreactor were transferred  at two separate times",

When  fast  growing early  stage bioreactor  cells were  transferred  into  the fresh nitrate-containing medium at 20 h, they exhibited the same rapid growth rate. Similarly,  when slow growing late-stage bioreactor cells were transferred  at 150 h, nitrate quickly restored most of  their earlier fast growth rate.  But  when  nitrate-free  medium  was  used,  the I Figure  6.

Since raising the medium nitrate concentration did not influence the final",
  "cell density (Fig. 6) and the metabolites present in the spent bioreactor medium did not inhibit cell growth (data  not  shown), the  maximal cell  density attainable with the medium in Table I (lacking CuS04)  seems to be determined by some component(s)  other than the C, 0,  and N sources. In an effort to identify one such limiting component, the effect of  the culture medium Fe level was investigated (Table IV). When  about half  of the  usual  Higgins medium  Fe  level (18 pmol/L)  was employed, whole-cell propene oxidative sMMO activity decreased  sharply  from 105 nmol  propene oxide formed/mg dry cell wt min to 47  nmol/mg  dry cell wt min at around 70 h. The cell density at that  time was 1.5 g dry wt/L,  which  was  also about one-half of the final cell density achievable with the standard medium Fe  level of 40 pmol/L  (Table I).  When  an  additional 50  pmol/L  of  Fe  was  supplemented  at  90  h  (total 68 pmol/L), a normal high level of  the sMMO activity was  restored",
  "within 24 h.  Furthermore,  cell  growth ( p = 0.009  h-') continued  up  to 5.4 g  dry  cell  wt/L without any appreciable decline in the whole cell enzymatic  activity.  This  rapid  and  large  Fe  effect  on  the sMMO activity is not too suprising, considering that Fe is an essential cofactor for the sMMO enzyme complex which can represent more than 10% of  the total soluble protein in some methanotr~phs.'~*'~~~~ From the dependence of  the final cell density on the initial medium Fe level, i.e., up to 40 pmol/L, it was possible to calculate the cell yield  on  Fe  as  approximately 1.3 x lo3 g  dry cell  wt/g  Fe.  This  is  about  five  times  lower  than  the value reported for Klebsiella  aerogenes,** and it may be attributable to high Fe requirement for sMMO production by  some methanotrophic bacteria. With an initial Fe level of  either 40 or 80 pmol/L, no sudden decreases in whole-cell sMMO activity were observed during the bioreactor  batch  cultivations,  although  the",
  "higher  Fe level raised the final cell density from 2.6 to 3.6 g dry wt/L  (Table  IV).  We  conclude  that  an  Fe  level  of 40 pmol/L in the original Higgins nitrate minimal salts culture medium (Table I) is marginal. Cultivation with Concentrated Medium In  spite  of  the  somewhat increased  final  cell  density with 80 pmol/L Fe (Table IV), it is still not certain that Fe  at the standard level of 40 pmol/L  is the key limiting medium component that  determines the final cell density. Instead of  further attempting to identify additional  presumptive limiting component(s) in  the  standard  medium,  batch  cultures were  grown  in  twofold and fourfold concentrated minus-Cu medium in order to increase the final cell density. The results with  the twofold concentrated  medium are plotted in  Figure 8. As anticipated, both the final cell density and X, were about  two  times  higher  than  those  of  the  standard medium. The sMMO acitvity remained above 100 nmol of  propene oxide",
  "formed/mg cell dry wt min until near the end of  the cultivation. With fourfold concentrated medium (data not shown), however, there was a serious DO limitation.  Initial  cell  growth  was  comparable to that of  twofold medium, but the DO level decreased to zero when the cell density reached 2.5 g dry cell wt/L and it remained there in spite of  our efforts to restore it  to 10%. As a result, the growth rate then  decreased and some cell lysis occurred causing massive foaming. Minus-Cu culture medium concentrated up to fourfold does not  alter  the  early-stage cell  growth  and  sMMO activity, but the advantages of  using it are offset by the oxygen limitations,  unless  this  can  be  overcome in  a given bioreactor .

  "Cell growth was found to be optimal at pH 6.07.0,  a  temperature  of  30-34\"C,  and  a  phosphate concentration of  10-40  mM. When M. trichosporium OB3b was cultivated in a bioreactor with continuous sparging of  its gaseous substrates, external C 0 2   addition was important to eliminate a long lag period in the cell growth. In  bioreactor  experiments  employing minus-Cu medium and the continuous supply of  a methane/ air/COz  gas mixture, a diauxic growth pattern was observed which was caused by  a switch in the nitrogen source from nitrate to gaseous nitrogen. A twofold  increase  in  the  culture  medium  nitrate concentration is recommended to delay the nitrate depletion and hence to shorten the total cultivat  ion time. Sustaining a high whole-cell specific sMMO activity  in  the  bioreactor  was  dependent  on  the  Fe availability  in  Higgins  culture  medium  lackjng CuS04. It  is  recommended  that  the  standard medium Fe  level be  increased to 80  pmol/L  for",
  "bioreactor experiments. The final bioreactor cell density was increased either by  raising the culture medium Fe level or by using  twofold  concentrated  complete  medium. Therefore, the use of  medium concentrated possibly  up  to  fourfold  is  suggested,  provided  the greater  oxygen  demand  can  be  satisfied  in  the bioreactor system to be used.
