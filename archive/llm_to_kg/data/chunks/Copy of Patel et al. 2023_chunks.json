Abstract: The production of renewable energy or biochemicals is gaining more attention to minimize the emissions of greenhouse gases such as methane (CH4) and carbon dioxide for sustainable development. In the present study, the influence of copper (Cu)- and iron (Fe)-based nanoparticles (NPs), such as Cu, Fe3O4, and CuFe2O4, was evaluated during the growth of methanotrophs for inoculum preparation and on the development of a polymeric-matrix-based encapsulation system to enhance methanol",
  "production from simulated biogas (CH4 and CO2). The use of simulated biogas feed and the presence of NP-derived inoculums produce a remarkable enhancement in methanol production up to 149% and 167% for Methyloferula stellata and Methylocystis bryophila free-cells-based bioconversion, respectively, compared with the use of pure CH4 as a control feed during the growth stage. Furthermore, these methanotrophs encapsulated within a polymeric matrix and NPs-based systems exhibited high methanol production of up to 156%, with a maximum methanol accumulation of 12.8 mmol/L over free cells. Furthermore, after encapsulation, the methanotrophs improved the stability of residual methanol production and retained up to 62.5-fold higher production potential than free cells under repeated batch reusability of 10 cycles. In the presence of CH4 vectors, methanol production by M. bryophila improved up to 16.4 mmol/L and retained 20% higher recycling stability for methanol production in paraffin oil.",
  "These findings suggest that Cu and Fe NPs can be beneficially employed with a polymeric matrix to encapsulate methanotrophs and improve methanol production. Keywords: biogas; greenhouse gases; encapsulation; methanol; methanotrophs; polymeric matrix 1. Introduction Methanotrophs are microbes that utilize methane (CH4) for growth and produce numerous value-added bioproducts such as methanol, 2,3-butanediol, ectoine, lactic acid, and biopolymers [1,2]. In recent years, the analysis of methanotrophic pathways and their metabolic engineering has significantly expanded to produce bioproducts from CH4 and carbon dioxide (CO2) as greenhouse gases (GHGs) [3,4]. Methanol production by methanotrophs can be beneficial over CH4 as an energy source due to its ~400 times higher density. Methanol can readily be transported or stored under ambient conditions compared with CH4. [5]. Methane monooxygenases (MMOs) catalyze CH4 to methanol in methanotrophs. Subsequently, during methanotroph metabolism,",
  "methanol is converted to formaldehyde by methanol dehydrogenase (MDH), formaldehyde is converted to formate by formaldehyde dehydrogenase and finally to CO2 by formate dehydrogenase [5]. The accumulation of methanol is influenced by the type of methanotroph and the conversion physiological conditions, such as the inoculum, incubation period, pH, temperature, and nature of the feed, such as pure CH4 or CO2, and biogas (CH4 and CO2) [6-8]. The low growth and methanol yield of methanotrophs are mainly associated with the partial solubility of CH4 in media and the successive metabolization of accumulated methanol Citation: Patel, S.K.S.; Gupta, R.K.; Kim, I.-W.; Lee, J.-K.

Strategies such as metabolic engineering and immobilization of methanotrophs have been shown to improve methanol production [11,12]. However, engineering methanotrophs can be challenging owing to the complicated procedures involved, especially homologous expression [12]. Using immobilized cells has been proven to be more beneficial than using free cells for repeated batch conversion and",
  "easy separation from the reaction mixture [6,11]. The immobilization of whole cells on solid supports is primarily limited by the non-ecofriendly chemical modification of the support for the binding of cells, including covalent immobilization, substantial loss of biocatalytic activity after immobilization, and low recycling stability of immobilized cells [6,11,13]. Therefore, the adaptation of suitable immobilization procedures can be beneficial to achieve higher methanol production because of the availability of a broad range of immobilization supports, such as biomass and polymeric or synthetic materials, and techniques, including adsorption, encapsulation, and covalent methods, for the attachment of cells to supports [11,14,15]. In addition, methanotroph growth and MMO activity are highly affected by metals such as copper (Cu) and iron (Fe) [16]. Nanoparticles (NPs) significantly affect cellular properties during growth or bioconversion applications [17]. Polymeric materials, such",
  "as silica, are desirable for supporting immobilized cells through encapsulation because of their high biocompatibility [18]. Therefore, the use of Cu- and Fe-based NPs and polymeric matrices is desirable for enhancing methanol production. In this study, the influence of Cu- and Fe-based NPs, such as Cu, Fe3O4, and CuFe2O4, was evaluated during the growth of methanotrophs to prepare competent inocula to enhance methanol biotransformation using simulated biogas as the feed. Furthermore, methanotrophs were encapsulated within a polymeric matrix containing NPs to improve cell stability and methanol production. Finally, the CH4 vectors allowed greater conversion under repeated recycling in batch-mode production. This is the first study to demonstrate enhanced methanol production from simulated biogas using a combined polymer and NP-based matrix approach for encapsulating precultured methanotrophs in the presence of NPs. 2. Materials and Methods 2.1. Materials and Cultures NPs of Cu (25 nm),",
  "CuFe2O4 (100 nm), Pluronic ® P-123 tri-block polymer [poly(ethylene glycol)-block-poly(propylene glycol)-block-poly(ethylene glycol)]), tetraethylorthosilicate (TEOS), polyethylene glycol, tetrazotized-o-dianisidine, 2,6-dichlorophenol-indophenol (DCPIP), phenazine methosulfate, Brij 35, paraffin oil, and silicon oil were procured from Sigma-Aldrich (Burlington, MA, USA). Fe3O4 (<100 nm) was procured from Nanostructured and Amorphous Materials, Inc. (Houston, TX, USA). All other chemicals used in this study were procured from commercial sources. High-purity gases were purchased from NKCo., Ltd. (Busan, Republic of Korea). Methanotrophs were purchased from the German Collection of Microorganisms and Cell Cultures (Braunschweig, Germany) [19]. 2.2. Influence of NPs on the Growth of Methanotrophs for Methanol Production Methanotrophs were cultivated in a 1 L flask (Duran-Schott, Germany) with an airtight screw cap (Suba seal, Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and with 200 mL of nitrate mineral salt",
  "(NMS) medium containing CH4 (30%, v / v ) or simulated biogas (CH4, 30% ( v / v ) and CO2, 7.5% ( v / v )) as feed for up to 5 days at 30 ◦ C, with shaking, in the presence of various NPs (0.01 mg/mL): Cu, Fe3O4, or CuFe2O4 [20]. The cell dry mass was analyzed using constant-weight measurements at 70 ◦ C [19]. The production of methanol in batch cultures was examined in 120 mL bottles (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) containing 20 mL of phosphate buffer (100 mM, pH 6.8) and MgCl2 (as MDH inhibitor), using methanotrophs inoculum at 3.0 mg DCM/mL from simulated biogas (CH4, 30% ( v / v ), and CO2, 15% ( v / v )) for incubation at 30 ◦ C for 48 h [21]. Polymers 2023 , 15 , 3667 3 of 13 2.3. Encapsulation of Whole Cells in Polymeric Matrix Containing Nanoparticles for Methanol Production and Biocatalytic Activity Methanotroph encapsulation was performed using a synthetic precursor solution (20 mL), which was a mixture of TEOS/Pluronic ® P-123/H2O/ethanol/HCl/glycerol (molar",
  "ratio:1:0.015:5.3:18.1:0.3:1.13; pH 5.0) and methanotrophs (cultured in NPs (0.01 mg/mL) containing NMS media) and fresh culture (1 mg of DCM/mL, 40 mL) [18]. Briefly, the fresh inoculum was mixed with the precursor solution, followed by incubation at 30 ◦ C for 2 h under continuous stirring. The encapsulated cells were washed with distilled water and buffer solution to remove any unbound cells. Furthermore, different NP (Cu, Fe3O4, or CuFe2O4) concentrations (0.01-0.05 mg/mL) were added to the synthetic precursor solution (TEOS/Pluronic ® P-123/H2O/ethanol/HCl/glycerol) during cell encapsulation to improve methanol production. The biocatalytic activities of the MMOs and the MDH of the methanotrophs were evaluated via naphthalene oxidation and DCPIP reduction via phenazine-methosulfate, respectively [20]. All encapsulated cells were stored at 4 ◦ C until further use. 2.4. Influence of Process Parameters on Methanol Production by Encapsulated Methanotrophs The effects of pH (6.0-8.0),",
  "followed by temperature (25-40 ◦ C), were evaluated for methanol production using free and encapsulated cells from simulated biogas (CH4, 30% ( v / v ), and CO2, 15% ( v / v )) at 30 ◦ C and 48 h of incubation. 2.5. Reusability Measurements The repeated-batch-mode methanol production by free and encapsulated M. bryophila within a CuFe2O4-containing polymeric matrix from simulated biogas at 30 ◦ C and 24 h of incubation was measured. Free and encapsulated cells were retrieved via centrifugation and used as the inoculum in the next batch cycle [22]. The initial efficiency of the methanol production or MMO activity of free and polymeric-matrix-encapsulated cells was considered to be 100%. 2.6. Influence of CH4 Vectors on Methanol Production by Encapsulated M. bryophila The effects of CH4 vectors (5%, w/v or v / v ), including Brij 35 repeated-batch-mode methanol production by free or encapsulated M. bryophila from simulated biogas at 30 ◦ C and 48 h of incubation were determined.",
  "Furthermore, to enhance methanol production, the reusability of up to 10 cycles for free and encapsulated M. bryophila within CuFe2O4containing polymeric matrix cells in the presence of paraffin oil (5%, v / v ) was evaluated. 2.7. Instrumental Analysis All absorbance measurements were performed spectrophotometrically using a 6705 UV/Vis spectrophotometer (Jenway Scientific, Staffordshire, UK) [22]. The methanol concentration was assessed using an Agilent 7890A chromatography system equipped with a flame ionization detector and an Agilent 19091 J-413 (HP-5) column (Santa Clara, CA, USA) [19]. Validation of whole-cell encapsulation within CuFe2O4-containing polymeric matrix was performed via field-emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM, JEOL, Tokyo, Japan) [21]. X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis was performed using an X'pert PRO MPD, Malvern PANalytical, Malvern, UK). All presented values are based on three experimental replicates. 3. Results and Discussion 3.1. Influence of NPs",
  "on the Growth of Methanotrophs to Enhance Methanol Production The NPs have been widely used in various renewable energy sources to modulate physiological properties such as the biocatalytic activity of whole cells containing metallic enzymes [17,23]. Pure CH4 has been widely used as a feed for methanotrophs to prepare inocula for converting simulated biogas into methanol [5,24]. Therefore, the effect of NPs based on Cu and Fe on the growth of methanotrophs to enhance methanol conversion Polymers 2023 , 15 , 3667 4 of 13 from biogas was evaluated in this study because these metals are involved in the MMO biocatalytic activity of methanotrophs [16,25]. With CH4 (30%) as the feed (control), M. bryophila and M. stellata had average specific growth rates ( µ ) of 0.013 and 0.008 h -1 , respectively, for up to 5 days of incubation (Table 1). The addition of CO2 (7.5%) at a 4:1 ratio during culture resulted in a slight increase in µ of up to 15% for these methanotrophs. The presence of",
  "various NPs (0.01 mg/mL) of Cu, Fe3O4, and CuFe2O4 resulted in higher values of up to 0.021 and 0.015 h -1 for methanotrophs using simulated biogas versus 0.019 and 0.012 h -1 using CH4 as a feed. In the presence of these NPs, µ improved by as much as 46.1% and 66.7% for M. bryophila and M. stellata , respectively. The higher µ in the presence of NPs was supported by better substrate utilization of 23.3% and 35.4% compared with the control values of 17.9% and 22.4% for M. bryophila and M. stellata , respectively (Table S1). The metabolism of CH4 and methanol accumulation in methanotrophs are illustrated in Figure 1. The CH4-feed-based inoculum as a control resulted in methanol production of 4.90 mmol/L (98.0 µ mol) for M. bryophila and 3.11 mmol/L (62.2 µ mol) for M. stellata after 48 h of incubation from simulated biogas as a feed (Table 1). Previously, the maximum methanol concentration accumulations of 0.02 and 0.71 mmol/L were reported from simulated biogas using CH4-based inocula",
  "of Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 and Methylosinus sporium KCTC 22312, respectively [9,26]. Up to 11% higher methanol production was observed for these methanotrophs by shifting the feed from pure CH4 to simulated biogas. The inocula of M. bryophila derived from NP media exhibited a remarkable enhancement in methanol production of up to 48, 25, and 67% for Cu, Fe3O4, and CuFe2O4, respectively. Similarly, M. stellata exhibited a relative efficiency of up to 149%. The methanol production profiles showed that the optimum incubation was recorded at 48 h using CH4- or simulated-biogas-based inocula (Figure S1). At a longer incubation of 96 h, the decline in methanol accumulation could have be linked to the subsequent metabolism of methanol by methanotrophs owing to partial MDH inhibition. The maximum methanol production enhancement was 8.18 mmol/L(164 µ mol) from 4.98 mmol/L for M. bryophila and 4.63 mmol/L (92.6 µ mol) from 3.11 mmol/L for M. stellata using simulated biogas as the",
  "feed with CuFe2O4-based inocula relative to the controls are shown in Figure S1. Previously, the effect of cerium on Methylacidiphilum fumariolicum growth during methanol production was reported, with a maximum methanol concentration accumulation of 4.9 mmol/L from simulated biogas [23]. In contrast, no methanol accumulation was recorded for M. fumariolicum using pure CH4 as the feed in the presence of cerium (1 µ M). The results of this study suggest that the Cu- and Fe-based NPs positively influence the growth and methanol production by M. bryophila and M. stellata using pure CH4 or simulated biogas as the feed.

Encapsulation of Methanotrophs within Polymeric Matrix Containing NPs 3.2. Encapsulation of Methanotrophs within Polymeric Matrix Containing NPs Polymers are well-known matrices with high biocompatibility for bioconversion applications in green synthesis [18]. Therefore, the encapsulation of methanotrophs within the pure polymeric matrix or embedded with NPs was evaluated to modulate methanol production from simulated biogas (Figure 2). The encapsulation of M. bryophila and M. stellata within a pure polymeric matrix produced slightly more methanol of 8.75 and 4.77 mmol/L, respectively, compared with the corresponding free-cell values of 8.18 and 4.63",
  "mmol/L, respectively (Table 2). Previously, M. trichosporium and M. sporium strains within a polymeric matrix exhibited a maximum methanol concentration accumulation of up to 1.97 mmol/L [27]. In contrast, a slightly lower methanol production concentration of 1.94 mmol/L was observed in the PVA-immobilized M. sporium system [28]. The combination of various NPs (0.01 mg/mL) with polymers exhibited a much higher relative efficiency for methanol, up to 138, 124, and 141% for Cu, Fe3O4, and CuFe2O4, respectively. The maximum methanol production was noted at 11.5 mmol/L (231 µmol) for M. bryophila and 5.79 mmol/L (116 µmol) for M. stellata using CuFe2O4 (0.01 mg/mL). Previously, a significantly lower efficiency for methanol production, between 40% and 68%, was reported for M. trichosporium immobilized on diethylaminoethyl cellulose, a mixed methanotroph culture on a ceramic ball, and for Methylomonas sp. immobilized on biomass-based coal and activated carbon [13-15]. The enhancement in",
  "methanol production or the stability of immobilized cells is primarily linked to MMO activity [11]. Higher relative MMO activities of 148 and 133% were observed for encapsulated cells over the corresponding M. bryophila Polymers are well-known matrices with high biocompatibility for bioconversion applications in green synthesis [18].

An optimum pH of 6.8 was noted for free and encapsulated M. bryophila and M. stellata . The cell residual methanol production was better maintained at lower and higher pH than their corresponding optimum values after encapsulation within the polymeric matrix (Figure 5a,b). The maximum residual methanol production improved for the M. bryophila CuFe2O4-based system to 8.09 and 11.8 mmol/L compared with the free cell values of 3.95 and 6.28 mmol/L at pH 6.0 and 8.0, respectively (Figure 5a). The various NPs-based encapsulated M. bryophila at these pH values retained higher residual methanol production of up to 30.8%. Under similar conditions, the CuFe2O4-based system of M. stellata exhibited a remarkable improvement in stability of as much as 312%",

Furthermore, an optimum temperature of 30 ◦ C was observed for free and encapsulated M. bryophila and M. stellata (Figure 5c,d). Previously, a higher temperature optimum for methanol accumulation was reported at 37 ◦ C and 55 ◦ C for Methylocaldum sp. and M. fumariolicum , respectively [23,34]. The residual methanol production declined to 5.13 and 0.80 mmol/L at 40 ◦ C in the case of free cells of M. bryophila and M. stellata , respectively. After encapsulation in a pure polymeric matrix, these methanotrophs exhibited residual methanol production of up to 5.81 mmol/L for M. bryophila and 1.71 mmol/L for M. stellata . At 40 ◦ C, the various NP-based encapsulated systems of M. bryophila and M. stellata exhibited improvement of up to 1.4- and 4.6-fold compared with the corresponding free cells.

Production Profiles and Recycling of Encapsulated M. bryophila within Polymeric Matrix Containing CuFe2O4 The incubation period is highly influenced by the methanol accumulation by methanotrophs from CH4 due to the partial inhibition of MDH activity [8,11]. Methanol production by free cells increased to 8.18 mmol/L at 48 h and then declined to 7.62 mmol/L after 96 h of incubation (Figure 6a). This reduction in methanol accumulation was associated with a relatively higher gain in MDH activity to 50.6% at 96 h and over 28.3% after 48 h (Figure 6b). Previously, a remarkable decline of ~50% in accumulated methanol concentration was noted with a longer incubation of 72 h compared with the optimum incubation of 48 h (0.02 mmol/L) for Methylosinus trichosporium IMV 3011 using simulated biogas as the feed [26].

Conclusions The use of renewable energy sources derived from GHGs is a suitable GHG mitigation strategy. In this study, the use of Cu- and Fe-based NPs proved beneficial for the growth of methanotrophs as inocula in converting simulated biogas to methanol. Furthermore, polymeric-matrix- and NP-based encapsulation systems of methanotrophs exhibited significantly higher residual methanol production than the control. The cells encapsulated within a polymeric matrix containing CuFe2O4 exhibited superior methanol production stability under repeated batch recycling. The addition of CH4 vectors during bioconversion by encapsulated cells resulted in high methanol production potential and retained better recycling stability. These findings suggest that polymeric matrices and NPs are desirable for high methanol production from simulated biogas. In the future,",
