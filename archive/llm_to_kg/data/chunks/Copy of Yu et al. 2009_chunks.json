Introduction Under copper limitation, type II methanotrophs, the type X methanotroph, Methylococcus capsulatus Bath, and some type I methanotrophs can produce soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) rather than the usual copper-containing particulate type (pMMO) (Hanson and Hanson, 1996; Koh et al.,",
  "1993). The soluble form of MMO has a broad substrate range and can degrade many chlorinated and aromatic organic compounds (Colby et al., 1977; Oldenhuis et al., 1989; Tsien et al., 1989). For this reason, methanotrophicbioreactors with high sMMO activities were developed to treat contaminated groundwater (Aziz et al., 1995; Phelps et al., 1990; Pressman et al., 1999), to produce sMMO-containing methanotrophs for bioaugmentation of contaminated sites (Duba et al., 1996; Rockne et al., 1998; Shah et al., 1996) or for industrial biotransformations (Lee et al., 1996). Productivities in such bioreactors are dependant on the amount of sMMO-containing biomass. However, to our knowledge, the highest dry biomass concentration ever attained without biomass recycle by a culture using methane ∗ Corresponding author at: Polyferm Canada Inc., 4530 CamdenE-Portland Bdry Rd, RR1, Harrowsmith, Ontario, Canada K0H 1V0.

  "bruce.ramsay@polyfermcanada.com (B.A. Ramsay). a b s t r a c t Soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO) can degrade many chlorinated and aromatic pollutants. It is produced by certain methanotrophs such as Methylosinus trichosporium when grown on methane under copper limitation but, due to its low aqueous solubility, methane cannot support dense biomass growth. Since it is water soluble, methanol may be a more attractive growth substrate, but it is widely believed that sMMO is not produced on methanol. In this study, when the growth-limiting substrate was switched from methane to methanol, in the presence of the particulate MMO inhibitor, allylthiourea, growth of M. trichosporium OB3b continued unabated and sMMO activity was completely retained. When allylthiourea was then removed, sMMO activity was maintained for an additional 24 generations, albeit at a slightly lower level due to the presence of 0.70 𝛍 Mof Cu 2+ in the feed medium. While a biomass density of only 2 g l -1 could be",
  "obtained on methane, 7.4 g l -1 was achieved by feeding methanol exponentially, and 29gl -1 was obtained using a modified feeding strategy employing on-line carbon dioxide production measurement. It was concluded that methanol can be employed to produce large amounts of M. trichosporium biomass containing sMMO. ©2008 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. as the sole source of carbon and energy was about 5 g l -1 (Asenjo and Suk, 1986) in a baffled shake-flask and about 18 g l -1 (with low sMMO activity) in a bioreactor (Shah et al., 1996). Higher biomass concentrations must be obtained to be economically attractive. The aforementioned limitations in bioreactor productivity were at least partly due to the low aqueous solubility of methane. As a carbon source, methane is first oxidized to methanol by MMO. Many methanotrophs are able to grow on methanol, with no need for methane. Methanol is inexpensive and presents fewer safety concerns than methane. More importantly, methanol is completely",
  "miscible in water so there is no mass transfer limitation of growth.Methylotrophshavebeenproducedinhigh-densityculture (Bourque et al., 1995), but none of these produce sMMO. Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b (ATCC 35070) is the type II methanotroph most frequently studied for sMMO production. It has been grown to a biomass concentration of 3.2gl -1 in chemostat culture on 1.0% (v/v) methanol (Best and Higgins, 1981). An sMMO constitutive mutant of M. trichosporium OB3b (PP358) produced 1.0gl -1 biomass on methanol (Fitch et al., 1996). Both aforementioned cultures retained sMMO activity on methanol. However, many publications have reported, and it is still generally believed, that no sMMO production occurs in type II methanotrophs grown on methanol (Hou et al., 1979; Patel et al., 1980; Sullivan et al., 1998). Based on this belief, significant studies have been conducted on the optimization and scale-up of M. trichosporium OB3b fermen- 0168-1656/$ - see front matter © 2008 Elsevier B.V.",

Material and methods 2.1. Organism and growth media M. trichosporium OB3b was",
  "maintained on nitrate mineral salts Noble agar plates and incubated in a methane-rich atmosphere (20%,v/vCH4).Twomediawereusedforcultivation.Nitratemineral salts (NMS) medium consisted of (in g l -1 ) NaNO3, 0.85; KH2PO4, 0.53; Na2HPO4 · 7H2O, 1.62; MgSO4 · 7H2O, 0.037; FeSO4 · 7H2O, 0.0112; CaCl2 · 2H2O, 0.007; and 1mll -1 of trace element solution containing (in g l -1 ) ZnSO4 · 7H2O, 0.287; MnSO4 · 7H2O, 0.223; H3BO3, 0.062; NaMoO4 · 2H2O, 0.048; CoCl2 · 6H2O, 0.048; and KI, 0.083. The pH was adjusted to 6.88 ± 0.10 using 0.2 M H2SO4. When grown on methanol, a variation of Choi's medium (Bourque et al., 1995) was used. It contained (in g l -1 ): (NH4)2SO4, 1.0; KH2PO4, 1.305; Na2HPO4 · 7H2O, 4.02; MgSO4 · 7H2O, 0.45; CaCl2 · 2H2O, 0.0033; FeSO4 · 7H2O, 0.0013; and 1mll -1 of the trace element solution described above. All media were prepared with deionized water. Stock solutions containing 10 g l -1 CaCl2 · 2H2O or FeSO4 · 7H2O were also prepared. 2.2. Inoculum preparation",

For methanolgrown cultures, 10 g l -1 methanol was introduced aseptically. The flasks were covered with foam stoppers and incubated at 30 ◦ C and 200rpm on a gyro-rotary shaker (Innova 44, New Brunswick Scientific, USA). For methane-grown innocula, the flasks were sealed with rubber stoppers fitted with two 0.2 𝛍 M filters. After inoculation, a methane/air mixture (20% CH4, v/v) was introduced to the flasks through the filter for 5 min at a flow rate of 3 l min -1 and then incubated at 30 ◦ C and 200rpm. When growth was observed, this culture was transferred to 2-l Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200ml NMS medium to prepare inocula for reactor fermentations. Gas feed and incubation conditions were the same as above. 2.3. Bioreactors and fermentation conditions Fed-batch fermentations were performed in a 2-l stirred-tank",
  "bioreactor (Multigen F-2000, New Brunswick Scientific, NJ, USA) with 1.25 l Choi's medium and 250 ml of a 72-h inoculum at 30 ◦ C, 500rpmagitation, and 0.5lmin -1 air or an air and oxygen mixture. Headspace CO2 was analyzed by a Guardian infrared CO2 analyzer (Topac Inc. Hingham, MA, USA). pH was controlled at 6.88 by the addition of 14% (w/v) ammonium hydroxide using a Bioengineering AG(Wald, Switzerland) controller. Data acquisition, substrate feeding, and DO control were performed using a data acquisition board (ADR2000, Ontrak Control Systems Inc. Sudbury, ON, Canada), and a Labview TM data acquisition and control program (National Instruments, Vaudreuil-Dorion, PQ, Canada). DO was maintained at 40% or more of air saturation using the Labview TM PID to adjust mass flow controllers and balance the air and oxygen flow rates as described previously (Sun et al., 2006). Substrate feeding was automatedusingaperistaltic pump (Masterflex ® 7520-35, Cole-Parmer",

The study of sMMO activity in different growth media was conducted in a 1.2-l Bioflo IIc reactor (New Brunswick Scientific, NJ, USA) operated as a chemostat at a dilution rate of 0.05 h -1 . When the culture was grown on methane, headspace methane content was maintained at 22% as described in Yu et al., 2006. Headspace methane content was continuously analyzed by recirculating headspace gas through an infrared CH4 analyzer (Guardian Plus methanemonitor,Topac,Inc.,Hingham,MA).Temperaturewas controlled at 30 ◦ C and agitation at 700 rpm. 2.4. Substrate feeding strategy Fed-batch fermentations began in batch mode with 5gl -1 of methanol. At 72h, exponential substrate feeding was initiated according to Eq. (1): where St is the total amount of methanol to be fed at time t (g), Xt is the desired biomass at time t",
  "(g), X 0 is the biomass when exponential feeding began (g), /SYN is the desired growth rate (h -1 ), and YX/S is the expected yield of biomass from substrate (g biomass gsubstrate -1 ). The feeding strategy described in Eq. (1) was modified based on carbon dioxide production for better control as shown in Eq. (2): where CCPt is the cumulative carbon dioxide production (g), and Y CO2 / S is the yield of carbon dioxide from substrate (g g -1 ). This strategy has been shown to be effective in the high-density biomass cultivation of Pseudomonas putida (Sun et al., 2006). 2.5. Calculation of specific growth rates Specific growth rates were calculated based on carbon dioxide production rate ( CPR ) as shown in Eq. (3): where /SYN CPR is specific growth rate based on carbon dioxide (h -1 ), CPR is carbon dioxide production rate (g h -1 ), and t is time (h). 80 Y.

Cell cultures were centrifuged and resuspended in NMS medium to a biomass concentration of 0.5gl -1 . Concentrated potassium formate was added to a final concentration of 20mM. The cell suspensions were incubated with naphthalene crystals at 200rpm, and 30 ◦ C for 1 h. The reaction solutions were then centrifuged and the naphthol content was determined by adding 0.1ml freshly prepared 1% o -dianisidine tetrazotized dye (Sigma-Aldrich) to 1 ml supernatant at the appropriate dilution. A purple color indicates sMMO activity. After mixing, 0.4 ml acetic acid was added to stabilize the color. The absorbance at 530nm was measured immediately and related to a standard curve (0-7mgnaphtholl -1 ). Specific sMMO activity was calculated as naphthalene oxidation rate per gram of biomass. 2.6.5. Measurement of headspace and aqueous phase methanol concentration Aqueous samples were withdrawn",
  "from the reactor and centrifuged at 12,500 × g for 6min. Methanol concentration in the supernatant was analyzed by a gas chromatograph (Varian 3400, Varian Canada Inc., Mississauga, ON) equipped with a Carbowax ® PEG column and a flame ionization detector (FID). Butanol was used as the internal standard. Injector and detector temperatures were 120 and 250 ◦ C, respectively. Helium was used as the carrier gas at a flow rate of 5mlmin -1 . The column temperature was held at 60 ◦ C for 1 min, increased to 150 ◦ C at 20 ◦ Cmin -1 , and then held for 1min. Methanol concentration was determined by relating peak area to that of a standard and corrected with the internal standard. For more rapid methanol analysis, 200 𝛍 l bioreactor off-gas samples were withdrawn from the reactor exhaust line with a gas-tight syringe and then injected in a Hewlett-Packard 5890 GC with a FID detector and a HP-5 column. Injector temperature, detector temperature, and helium flow rate were the same as the aqueous",
  "sample analysis but the oven temperature was maintained at 90 ◦ C. Headspace samples were compared with a methanol standard. Aqueous methanol concentration was then estimated using a Henry's law constant of 1.4 × 10 2 Matm -1 (Yaws and Yang, 1992). 1.0 3. Results 3.1. sMMO activity The capacity of M. trichosporium OB3b to retain sMMO activity while growing on methanol was investigated. The culture was initially grown in batch mode on NMS medium with methane as the sole source of carbon and energy. Although the medium was formulated to minimize copper content, about 0.70 𝛍 M Cu 2+ was still present in the feed. Therefore, allylthiourea (15 𝛍 M) was added to inhibit synthesis of pMMO. Continuous medium flow began at 71 h with a dilution rate of 0.05 h -1 . Headspace methane was maintained at 22% (v/v). As steady state was approached (judged by methane uptake rate, CO2 production, biomass concentration, and sMMO activity), sMMO activity of about 550 𝛍 mol naphthol produced gbiomass -1 h",
  "-1 was obtained (Fig. 1), which is comparable to the sMMO activity usually reported for this strain when grown on methane in the absence of copper (Bowman and Sayler, 1994; Koh et al., 1993). After stopping the methane supply and switching to feed containing methanol, the majority of the sMMOactivity remained intact. During the brief period when both methane and methanol were present, higher sMMO activity was observed. After 6 generations of growth on methanol with allylthiourea, the feed was changed to one without allylthiourea. The specific sMMO activity dropped only slightly to 490 𝛍 mol naphthol produced gbiomass -1 h -1 (Fig. 2). This level of sMMO activity was maintained for 24 generations. Subsequent addition of 4.5 𝛍 Mcopper to the growth medium caused sMMO activity to diminish to Fig. 1. Batch and chemostat growth of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b. The culture was first grown in batch culture on methane with 15 𝛍 M of the pMMO inhibitor allylthiourea. Continuous flow of the",

After steady state was achieved on methane (190 h), the methane supply wasstoppedandamediumcontaining4gl -1 methanoland15 𝛍 Mallylthiourea was continuously fed. Y.

Fed-batch fermentation using exponential feeding of methanol Once stability of sMMO in methanol-grown cells was established, a methodology for producing high-density M. trichosporium OB3b biomass was investigated. Growth in shake-flasks occurred at up to 40 g l -1 of initial methanol concentration but only after a long lag period, so batch cultivation was initiated with 5 g l -1 of methanol (Fig. 3). At 72 h, methanol feeding began at a rate designed to produce a /SYN of 0.06h -1 . However the /SYN CPR (specific growth rate calculated based on CO2 production) was only 0.037h -1 , this resulted in methanol accumulation in the fermentation broth. At 86.2, 109.4, 135.8, and 157.5 h, methanol feeding was stopped for 6.5, 3.8, 12.2 and 14.0 h, respectively (as seen in the plateaus in the 'methanol",
  "fed' data in Fig. 3) to allow the concentration to decrease. Over 160 h of fed-batch fermentation, 7.4 g l -1 biomass was produced. The inhibitory effect of methanol was examined at time periods where changes in growth rate and methanol concentration occurred. For example, at 157.5 h, after methanol feeding was stopped, the residual methanol dropped from 3.28 to 0.47gl -1 , /SYN CPR increased to as high as 0.3 h -1 (Fig. 3). The results demonstrated that a methanol concentration above 3 g l -1 hasasignificant inhibitory effect on metabolic activity. The increase in /SYN CPR caused the methanol concentration to drop rapidly to growth-limiting values (less than 0.47 g l -1 ). This caused the /SYN CPR to decrease to a point Batch (a) Fed-Batch 0.4 16 14 0.3 Fig. 3. Fed-batch fermentation of Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b on methanol using an exponential feeding strategy. Methanol feeding was designed to obtain a /SYN of 0.06 h -1 . Methanol concentration in the aqueous phase was measured",
  "in liquid samples ( /Delta1 , actual) or estimated from headspace samples ( /squaresolid , estimated). At 131.8 h (first arrow), 1 ml each of the CaCl2 · 2H2O, FeSO4 · 7H2O, and trace element stock solutions was added. At 155.3 h (second arrow), 2 ml of each of these solutions was added. where cell growth could not be recovered. These results are typical of several fermentations conducted in a similar manner. This ineffective feeding strategy was then modified. Instead of using a pre-set /SYN , CCP was used to control methanol feeding. Y CO2 / S was determined from previous experiments to be 0.73gg -1 and two fermentations with two different methanol concentration setpoints were performed to assess the new feeding strategy (Fig. 4). Methanol concentration was better controlled at low biomass concentrations, but high methanol demand (based on CCP) at higher biomass concentrations resulted in over-feeding in both fermentations. A dry weight biomass density of 19 g l -1 wasobtainedin169h",
  "when the methanol concentration was controlled at about 3gl -1 (Fig. 4a). An even higher biomass density of 29 g l -1 was achieved in only 119 h by further lowering the methanol concentration setpoint to about 2 g l -1 (Fig. 4b). Whether due to deviation of the CO2 analyzer or an actual change of cell yield, the measured Y CO2 / S was not constant throughout the fermentation. Slight adjustments of the yield value were necessary. The Y CO2 / S used in the control equation (Eq. (2)) was gradually increased to 0.87 by the end of both fermentations. For all fed-batch fermentations, mineral salts were supplemented at points indicated by arrows in Figs. 3 and 4. 4. Discussion SincetypeIImethanotrophssuchas M.trichosporium OB3bgrow so slowly, attempts have been made to produce sMMO in recombinantorganisms.Althoughprogressisbeingmadeinthisarea(Smith et al., 2002), expression of fully active sMMO in the recombinants is hampered by the complex nature of the enzyme, especially the hydroxylase",
  "component. Therefore, we chose to examine sMMO production in a wild type strain growing on a more suitable growth substrate than methane. While a couple of studies have found that type II methanotrophs express sMMO when grown on methanol (Best and Higgins, 1981), most have concluded that they do not (Hou et al., 1979; Patel et al., 1980). In our chemostat experiments, there was no apparent difference in sMMO production whether M. trichosporium OB3b was grown on methane or on methanol. 82 Y.

Activity could be recovered by growing it on methane withcopperlimitation.ThereasonwhyMMOactivityismaintained while growing on methanol in some experiments but not others, remains to be determined. Never the less, the data from the present study proves conclusively that sMMO activity can be maintained in cultures growing on methanol. This strain of M. trichosporium can tolerate exposure to as much as 40gl -1 methanol, but 3gl -1 was found to",
  "significantly inhibit growth. Therefore chemostat or well-controlled fed-batch culture are the most likely methods for the production of sMMO competent M. trichosporium from methanol. Control of fed-batch fermentations depends on supplying all of the nutrients at appropriate rates or concentrations. In terms of fermentation control, the key nutrient in this case is methanol. If the methanol level falls too low, growth slows due to limitation in carbon or energy, while, if there is too much methanol, growth will slow because of inhibition. As showninFig.5,beforemethanolfeedingwasstopped,themethanol concentration was above 3gl -1 and the CO2 production remained almost constant. Once methanol feeding was stopped at 157.5h, the CO2 production began to increase as methanol concentration dropped. When entirely deprived of methanol, the cells may enter a physiological state where recovery of rapid growth is severely retarded even after addition of sufficient methanol. This occurred at the end",
  "of the fermentation depicted in Fig. 3. We obtained a M. trichosporium OB3b biomass concentration of 29gl -1 using a CCPbased strategy to control the methanol concentration. Much higher cell densities should be obtainable if the methanol concentration can be more rigorously controlled. The specific growth rate on methanol, whether in chemostat or fed-batch, was generally less than 0.1 h -1 even when higher (a) 6.0 65 - 5.0 • 3.0 Fig. 5. The effect of methanol concentration on carbon dioxide production during a portion of the fed-fermentation depicted in Fig. 3. feeding rates were imposed. This is similar to growth on methane. Thus, although a much higher biomass density may be obtained from growth on methanol, productivity is still limited by a low growth rate. However, the transient /SYN CPR reached as high as 0.3 h -1 at about 0.7 g l -1 methanol. Although the specific growth rate calculated from carbon dioxide production data may be misleading under transient conditions due to",
  "unbalanced growth, these data suggest the intriguing possibility of higher growth rates, but other factors require investigation. For example, PO4 and other ions have been shown to inhibit methanol dehydrogenase activity (Mehta et al., 1989) and previous work (Yu et al., 2006) indicated the presence of a metabolic bottleneck in this organism. However, if these barriers can be overcome, and if sufficient control of the concentration of methanol and other significant medium components during fedbatch fermentation can be maintained, it may be possible to obtain asubstantialincreaseinspecificgrowthrate.Evenifthegrowthrate is not increased, substantially higher biomassconcentrationscanbe obtained on methanol by fed-batch fermentation. This knowledge, combined with the conclusive evidence that sMMO expression can be maintained during growth on methanol should aid in the development of sMMO-based industrial and environmental processes. In future work, we intend to develop an improved process",
  "for the control of methanol during fed-batch fermentations and to monitor sMMO production throughout these fermentations. This should result in much higher biomass densities and provide greater insight regarding the effects of methylotrophic fed-batch conditions on sMMO synthesis.
