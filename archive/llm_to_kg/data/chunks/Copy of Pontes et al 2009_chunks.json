  "determine ethanol, acetaldehyde, methanol, and acetone in different human matrices, such as whole blood, vitreous humour, and urine, with clinical and forensic interest. This method was also employed to quantify these compounds in cell culture medium, thus being useful in basic research. A good peak resolution was achieved, with linear correlation between concentration and peak areas for all the compounds in all the matrices. The inter- and intra-day precisions of the method were always under 15% and 10%, respectively. The accuracy of the method, calculated as the percentage of the target concentration, was within the acceptable limits. The obtained limits of detection were below 0.85 mg/L for acetaldehyde and below 0.75 mg/L for the other considered compounds. The small injection volume and the high split ratios applied, allied to the high performance of the GC column, resulted in very good peak resolution and high sensitivities. This method is easy to perform, making it suitable for",
  "the routine of clinical biochemistry and forensic laboratories. Introduction Gas chromatographic (GC) methodologies have been reported, being the volatile fraction analysed by diversified techniques (1-5). Chronologically, the direct sample injection in packed columns (1,3) became obsolete and was gradually substituted by headspace techniques in capillary columns (6) and, more recently, by the selective headspace injection using solid-phase microextraction (SPME) fibers (5,7,8). However, both headspace methodologies require an accurate time- and temperature-controlled sample heating. When the automatic injectors are not available, reproducibility problems are difficult to overcome. Moreover, the influence of the biological specimen on the partitioning of the volatile compounds between liquid and headspace vapour and the selectivity of the SPME fibres increase both the complexity of method develop- * Authors to whom correspondence should be addressed: Helena de Oliveira Pontes and Paula",

In addition, the headspace techniques usually require larger sample volumes and have higher detection limits. Ethanol, acetaldehyde, methanol, and acetone are volatile compounds whose detection and quantification in biological matrices can be used as biomarkers of several diseases and/or intoxications. Ethanol consumption is under strict regulations in many circumstances, and legal blood alcohol concentration limits for driving are well established. Over-consumption of alcoholic beverages and drunkenness are almost always closely related with fatal accidents, trauma deaths, drowning, suicide, and violent crimes (10). These considerations justify the importance of the determination of ethanol levels in ante-mortem and post-mortem specimens with great importance in the forensic domain",
  "(4). Humans are frequently exposed to naturally occurring acetaldehyde that can exist in the air and that can be ingested as a contaminant of food and alcoholic drinks because it is the main compound formed during ethanol metabolism. Additionally, humans are also exposed to acetaldehyde coming from automobile exhaust, cigarette smoke, fireplaces, and occupational settings. This compound has been associated with cancer development in animal experiments, and has been classified as a possible carcinogenic agent to humans by the International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization (11). Thus, from a clinical point of view, its quantification in biological samples is of paramount importance. The quantification of methanol in body fluids is very important for confirmation of methanol intoxication-related deaths (12). The quantification of methanol in biological fluids can also be a biomarker of intentional (13), accidental (for example, by ingestion in adulterated",
  "drinks) (14), or occupational exposure (15). Acetone can be a biomarker of ketoacidosis, which can help to diagnose ante-mortem diabetes mellitus, though it can also be a likely cause of death in binge drinkers and alcoholics (16), and can be very useful in the diagnosis of death from hypothermia (17). Ketoacidosis is diagnosed by analysis of high levels of ketone bodies in body fluids, namely acetone, acetoacetate, and particularly β -hydroxybutyrate (18). Additionally, the quantification of acetone in biological fluids can be a biomarker of occupational exposure (15). 272 Reproduction (photocopying) of editorial content of this journal is prohibited without publisher's permission.

  "compounds in blood and urine from ante-mortem and post-mortem specimens, we validated the present method in these matrices. However, as post-mortem compound levels in blood do not necessarily reflect the concentration at the time of death, due to drug instability and post-mortem redistribution phenomena (19), measurements of vitreous humour (VH) concentrations could be of interest for predicting the blood concentration at the time of death in humans (20). VH is a very useful matrix because the vitreous fluid is less influenced by autolytic processes, is simple to collect, and is not affected by hemolysis (10). Additionally, it is a clean fluid that contains less protein than urine and exhibits high stability (21). Thus, VH has been recently demonstrated to be a suitable alternative specimen to post-mortem blood and urine, not only for the analysis of ethanol intoxications, but also for other drugs as well as endogenous biochemical constituents of the body to detect ante-mortem diseases",
  "(10). VH is, additionally, more resistant to putrefactive changes than other specimens, such as blood (8,22). Due to these advantages, VH determinations have formerly been performed in order to detect various drugs, in particular ethanol (10) as well as morphine (23), cocaine (24), and amitriptyline (25). The validation of this method for its application in cell culture medium (CCM) samples is also important due to the need of controlling the levels of these compounds when a cell culture is used to study their effects on cell physiology and toxicity (26). Thus, there is an obvious need to develop an inexpensive, sensitive, rapid, and reliable alternative GC method. In this study, a GC direct injection in capillary columns method is proposed to quantify ethanol, acetaldehyde, methanol, and acetone, and it is applied to different matrices, such as whole blood (B), VH, urine (U), and CCM. Based on the previously mentioned rationale, the aim of this work was to develop an easy direct",
  "injection GC methodology to determine, simultaneously, some of the most important volatiles found in biological samples with clinical, forensic, and research interest and to apply it to several matrices. Materials and Methods Reagents All the chemicals used were of analytical grade: ethanol (> 99.9%, Panreac, Barcelona, Spain), methanol (> 99.9%, Merck, Darmstadt, Germany), 1-propanol (> 99%, Sigma-Aldrich Co., St. Louis, MO), acetone (> 99.9%, Merck), acetaldehyde (> 99.9%, Fluka, Milwaukee, WI), Triton X100 (Sigma-Aldrich Co.), and acetonitrile (> 99.9%, Merck).

Additionally, the interference between the tested compounds and some other volatile biomarkers of some diseases and with great forensic interest was excluded, such as formaldehyde, methyl and ethyl formate, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, 1,4-butanediol, and 2,3butanediol. 1.0 Volatile-free B, U, VH, and CCM were used to prepare the control samples and calibration curves. y= 0.0196x + 0.6793 R: = 0.9997 • Methanol y = 0.0119x + 0.0543 Calibration procedures R? = 0.9973 y =0.0204x + 0.0227 R: = 0.9999 Concentrated solutions of 500 g/L ethanol, 50 g/L methanol, 50 g/L acetaldehyde, and 50 g/L acetone were prepared daily by dilution of the commercial solutions in deionized water. Daily prepared 2.2 g/L 1-propanol in deionized water was used as internal standard (IS). A stock calibrator containing 10 g/L ethanol, 1 g/L methanol, 1 g/L acetaldehyde, and 1 g/L acetone was prepared daily in each tested matrix, from the concentrated solutions. The calibration",

These calibration standards, in B and VH, underwent a 5 times dilution with a solution containing 1.2% of Triton X-100 and 1.8 g/L of acetonitrile in water, to decrease sample viscosity and therefore facilitate volume measurements and sample injection, according to the method described by Dubowski (27). 50 100 150 Each tube was vortex-mixed and centrifuged at 16,000 g for 5 min at 4°C.

Validation experiments and acceptance criteria Method linearity Method linearity was determined by evaluating the regression curve and is indicated by the square correlation coefficient ( R 2 ). The line of best fit for the relationship between the ratio of peak area and internal standard area and concentration of analytes in the samples was determined by linear regression performing calibration curves in the considered concentration ranges (7.5-240 mg/L for acetaldehyde, acetone, and methanol, and 75-2400 mg/L for ethanol). For U and CCM, the slopes were calculated taking into account the mean of 5 calibration curves prepared in each matrix on 5 consecutive",
  "days. For B and VH, the slopes were based on the mean of 3 curves prepared in these matrices on 3 consecutive days. Linearity was achieved with a minimal R 2 of 0.99. Precision For U and CCM, the intra-day precision of the method was determined by injecting, on the same day, 5 different replicate calibrators of each one of the 7 points of the calibration curves; the intra-day precision of the apparatus was determined by analysing 5 times, on the same day, the 7 calibrators of one of the calibration curves; the inter-day precision of the method was determined by analyzing, for 5 consecutive days, daily prepared calibrators of the 7 concentrations considered for the calibration curves. For B and VH, due to the complexity of these samples, the intra-day precision of the method was determined injecting, on the same day, 6 independent calibrators containing 1200 mg/L of ethanol and 120 mg/L of acetaldehyde, acetone, and methanol; the intra-day precision of the apparatus was determined",
  "injecting 6 times, on the same day, one of the concentrations contemplated in the calibration curves (1200 mg/L for ethanol and 120 mg/L for acetaldehyde, acetone, and methanol); the inter-day precision of the method was evaluated by analyzing, for 3 consecutive days, daily prepared calibrators of all the 7 concentrations considered for the calibration curves. Precision was assessed by calculating the mean, standard deviation, and coefficient of variation (CV%) of the observed values. Limits of detection and quantitation To determine the sensitivity of the method, the calibrators with the lowest concentrations (7.5 mg/L for methanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone and 75 mg/L for ethanol) of each matrix (U, B, VH, and CCM) were progressively diluted to determine the limit of detection (LOD) and quantitation (LOQ). A signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was considered acceptable for estimating the LOD (28). The concentration that originated the peak with a signal-to-noise ratio of 3 was injected 5",
  "times. The LOQ for each matrix was estimated based on a signal-tonoise ratio of 10 obtained for calibration solutions containing the compounds of interest. The LOQ corresponds to the lowest concentration obtained by successive dilutions of standards that originate a sharp and symmetrical chromatographic peak, required for routine analysis. Peaks that were excessively broad, showing tailing or shoulders, or that did not resolve to within 10% baseline were not considered (29). Accuracy Accuracy (A%) was calculated in terms of bias as the percent deviation of the mean calculated concentration at each concentration level from the corresponding theoretical concentration: A% = (mean calculated concentration nominal concentration) / (nominal concentration) × 100. Results and Discussion GC separation Interferents were ruled out by verifying the absence of peaks in the retention times of the studies analytes (Figures 2A and 2B). As shown in Figure 2, the retention times for acetaldehyde,",
  "acetone, methanol, and ethanol in all tested matrices (Figures 2C and 2D) were 1.66, 2.02, 2.70, and 3.16 min, respectively. The IS (1-propanol) retention time was 5.26 min. The peak at 3.71 min in the chromatogram in Figure 2B (B and VH) corresponds to the peak of acetonitrile, which is part of the triton X-100 and acetonitrile solution used to dilute these complex matrices. Method validation Linearity Regression analysis of calibration data achieved satisfactory linearity over the considered concentration range. Square correlation coefficients ( R 2 ) were always > 0.99, indicating a linear relationship from 7.5 to 240 mg/L for acetaldehyde, methanol, and acetone, and from 75 to 2400 mg/L for ethanol in all the studied matrices. The slopes and square correlation coefficients are presented in Figures 3A-3H for CCM, U, B, and VH, respectively. Sensitivity The LOD and LOQ for each compound in each matrix are shown in Table I. Effect of the split ratio on the sensitivity of the method.",
  "The effect of the split ratio on the sensitivity of the method is illustrated in Figure 4. For the B matrix, higher split ratios were needed to protect liners and the chromatographic column. However, if lower LODs are needed, the split ratio can be decreased until 1:50. For the other matrices, a good peak resolution can still be obtained for ratios up to 1:30 (data not shown). Inter-day CV% and A% of the method. The results for the 4 matrices and for 3 representative concentrations are presented in Table II. For CCM and U, the simplest matrices, the obtained inter-day CV% were always lower than 10%. For VH and B, due to sample manipulations, the inter-day CV% was less favorable. The average coefficients of variation (ACV%) of all the tested concentrations are presented in Table III and were always lower than 15%. 276 Journal of Chromatographic Science, Vol. 47, April 2009 Downloaded from https://academic.oup.com/chromsci/article/47/4/272/396871 by guest on 25 April 2024 The A% of the",

Intra-day precision of the method and of the apparatus. The intra-day precision of the method and of the apparatus for the 4 tested compounds in the 4 considered matrices are presented in Table III as ACV% that are always lower than 10%. Concerning the intra-day precision of the apparatus, the ACV% were always between 2%, and 9% was the lowest ACV% obtained for ethanol in U and the highest for acetaldehyde in B. The ACV% values obtained for B and VH were higher than those obtained for CCM and U due to the need of more sample manipulations (Table III). Concerning the intra-day precision of the method, the ACV% were always between 3%, and 9% was the lowest ACV% obtained for ethanol in B and the highest for methanol in B (Table III). Discussion As shown in Figure 2, the selected chromatographic conditions resulted in a good",
  "chromatographic resolution, with good peak separation. In addition, the good chromatographic separation between the studied compounds and some other important volatiles such as formaldehyde, methyl and ethyl formate, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerol, 1,4-butanediol, and 2,3-butanediol, recognized as biomarkers of some diseases and/or having great forensic interest, evince the interest of this method for a future adaptation to quantify these volatiles. This fact is a great advantage of this method, indicating its possible broad applicability. A very good linear correlation ( R 2 > 0.99) between the concentration and the ratio between the compound peak and the IS peak was obtained for all the tested compounds in all the tested matrices. The proposed acceptance limits for the accuracy were 100 ± 20% (28) and, only in the case of VH, and for some concentrations, the obtained accuracy results were out of these limits. The injection of 0.5 µL of blank matrices showed no",
  "interferences with other constituents from B, VH, CCM, and U, allowing the detection of very small amounts of the studied compounds. Several methods for the analysis of ethanol that are also concerned with the simultaneous monitoring of acetaldehyde, methanol, or acetone concentrations have been reported (9,30-32). GC-mass spectrometry (MS) methods have also been applied to measure ethanol concentrations in different biological matrices (31,33,34). However, GC-MS is a much more complex technique than GC-FID and requires highly trained personnel. In consonance with these previous methods, the technique described in the present study enables the GC-FID analysis of B, U, VH, and CCM for the presence of ethanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and methanol without any pretreatment, in the case of U and CCM, and with a simple dilution with triton X-100 and acetonitrile for VH and B. The sensitivity depends on the volume injected and on the split ratio. In this work, and in the case of B, to prevent",
  "the shelf-life of the chromatographic column, the volume injected was 0.5 µL and the split ratio was 1:100. For more sensitive determinations, 1 µL or even larger volumes can be injected and the split ratio can also be decreased, easily decreasing the LOD to levels lower than 0.1 mg/L. For the suggested chromatographic conditions, the LOD obtained with B were: 0.84 mg/L for acetaldehyde, and 0.75 mg/L for acetone, methanol, and ethanol. However, by changing the split ratio, the LOD can be easily decreased 10 times, which means: 0.075 mg/L for ethanol, acetone, and methanol, and 0.084 mg/L for acetaldehyde (3). Table III. Compilation of the ACV% Obtained for the Evaluation of the Intra-Day Precision of the GC-FID Apparatus, the Intra-Day Precision of the Method, and the Inter-Day Precision of the Method Conclusion In conclusion, the direct GC-FID injection method using capillary columns presented here is a highly sensitive, rapid, and reliable procedure to determine a plethora of",

For the first time, a method was validated for the simultaneous determination of acetaldehyde, acetone, methanol, and ethanol in four different matrices (human B, U, VH, and CCM). The small amounts of sample injected (0.5 µL) and the high split ratios applied (1:60 and 1:100), allied to the high performance of the GC column, result in very good peak resolution and high sensitivities.
