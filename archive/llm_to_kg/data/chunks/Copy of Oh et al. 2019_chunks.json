Several  independent  variables  including  ethane",
  "concentration  and biocatalyst amounts, among other factors, were optimized for the enhancement of ethane-to-ethanol bioconversion. We obtained 0.4 g/L/h of volumetric productivity and 0.52 g/L of maximum titer in optimum batch reaction conditions. In this study, we demonstrate that the biological gas-to-liquid conversion of ethane to ethanol has potent technical feasibility as a new application of ethane gas. Keywords: methane monooxygenase; methanotrophs; ethane; ethanol; gas-to-liquid 1. Introduction Bioethanol is used for chemical feedstock and gasoline blending [1]. More than 20% bioethanol is expected to be added to fuel for motor vehicles in South America and Brazil in order to replace gasoline.  Bioethanol-blended  gasoline  for  transportation  can  reduce  both  the  dependency  on petroleum-based fuels and the concern about global warming [2]. Further, ethanol has a higher octane rating than gasoline, allowing for the efficient production of power due to an enhanced",
  "compression ratio  [3].  On  the  basis  of  these  advantages  and  considering  the  increase  in  energy  consumption associated  with  population  growth  and  industrial  development,  the  demand  for  bioethanol  is expected to surpass 125 billion liters by 2020, from 46 billion liters in 2007 [2]. The conventional processes for ethanol production are hydration of ethylene and bioethanol fermentation of sugar using yeast. The direct hydration of ethylene is accomplished at 250-300 °C and 70-80 atm in the presence of steam [4]. The requirement of high temperature and high pressure causes an increase in production cost [5]. In the case of bioethanol fermentation, one molecule of glucose produces two molecules of bioethanol with release of two molecules of CO2. This causes technical problems such as carbon loss and the generation of greenhouse gases. Another issue of bioethanol fermentation from corn and sugarcane is the problem of increasing food prices by using food resources as",
  "an energy source [6]. Thus, lignocellulosic biomass can mitigate food dependency in bioethanol production. However, pretreatment, which is an expensive and complicated process, together with an enzymatic saccharification step, is required to produce bioethanol by fermentation [1,7]. Molecules 2019 , 24 , 591; doi:10.3390/molecules24030591 www.mdpi.com/journal/molecules Molecules 2019 , 24 , 591 2  of  9 Natural gas composed of methane and ethane remains an untapped energy source or chemical feedstock. Methanotrophs can utilize methane as a sole carbon and energy source, and the first step in  their  methane utilization is the oxidation of methane by methane monooxygenase (MMO) [8]. Metabolic  engineering  of  methanotrophs  for  producing  value-added  products  from  methane  has been conducted, as methane remains a remarkably cheap feedstock [5]. There are two types of MMOs, soluble  MMO  (sMMO)  and  particulate  MMO  (pMMO).  pMMO  can  oxidize  short-chain  alkanes (generally less",
  "than five carbon long) and alkenes, whereas sMMO has a relatively broad substrate specificity and can oxidize aromatics, chlorinated aromatics, as well as alkanes and alkenes [9]. At low  concentrations  of  copper,  sMMO  is  expressed  and  catalyzes  methane  oxidation  using nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH) as the reducing agent in the cytosol. At a high level of copper concentration, pMMO is expressed in the intracytoplasmic membranes and uses a reduced ubiquinone as the electron donor [10-12]. Some methanotrophs possess both sMMO and pMMO, and the expression of sMMO and pMMO is regulated by copper concentration. Cells expressing pMMO have a higher growth rate due to the higher affinity of pMMO for methane [13,14]. Ethane is used for the production of ethylene by steam cracking. The steam cracking process is one of the most energy-intensive processes in the chemical industry and it causes almost 180-200 million tons of carbon dioxide emissions in the world annually [15].",
  "Recently, the biological oxidation of  short-chain  alkane  gases,  such  as  ethane  to  liquid  alcohols,  has  been  investigated  using  an engineered cytochrome P450 [16,17]. Ethane can be utilized for ethanol production by methanotrophic bacteria because  MMO oxidizes ethane as well as methane because of its  broad substrate specificity [9]. This process is not accompanied by carbon dioxide emission since MMO converts  one  molecule  of  ethane  into  one  molecule  of  ethanol  in  mild  conditions,  which  is  an environmentally friendly approach compared to the chemical process [10,18]. Methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) exists in methanotrophs and catalyzes the oxidation of both methanol to formaldehyde and ethanol to acetaldehyde [19]. In methanotrophic whole cells, ethanol can  also  be  consumed  by  alcohol  dehydrogenase  [20].  Thus,  the  inhibition  of  MDH  by  chemical inhibitors is required for methanol accumulation. However, the addition of an MDH inhibitor blocks the",
  "generation of NADH from the oxidation of methanol to formaldehyde. In order to solve this problem, sodium formate was added to replenish NADH [21]. Whole-cell conversions of ethane to ethanol have been studied using methanotrophs as a biocatalyst. Previous studies have shown that ethane could be converted into ethanol on the basis of MDH inhibition and the addition of sodium formate, which demonstrates conceptually the biotransformation of ethane gas substrate [20,22]. In this study, we compared some representative methanotrophs in order to evaluate their ability of bioconversion of ethane to ethanol and investigated the optimal conditions for obtaining a high titer of ethanol using various concentrations of MDH inhibitor and formate in a quantitative way. In addition, the concentration of the cells and substrate and the pH values were optimized. 2. Results and Discussion 2.1. Evaluation of Ethane-Oxidizing Bacteria First, we evaluated methanotrophs for their ability to oxidize ethane",
  "to ethanol in batch systems to  select  the  best  strain. Methylomonas sp.  DH-1  and Methylomicrobium  alcaliphilum 20Z in  Type  I methanotrophs and Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b in type II methanotrophs were tested as the biocatalyst for ethane oxidation. Methylomonas sp. DH-1 and M. alcaliphilum 20Z have pMMO. M. trichosporium OB3b has both sMMO and pMMO. When M. trichosporium OB3b was cultured in a growth medium containing 5 μM CuSO4, pMMO was expressed, and the expression of sMMO was inhibited, increasing cell growth [23]. All bioconversion reactions in this study were conducted on the basis of pMMO activity, which has a higher affinity for short-chain alkanes than sMMO [14]. Quantitative analysis of the samples revealed that M. trichosporium OB3b produced more ethanol than other strains, and M. alcaliphilum 20Z did not accumulate ethanol from ethane (Figure 1). In a previous study, whole-cell experiments Molecules 2019 , 24 , 591 3  of  9 with strain 20Z showed pH-dependent",
  "rates of methane oxidation, with the highest rate at pH 9.0 and a much slower rate at pH 7.0 or 10.0 [24]. Thus, M. alcaliphilum 20Z showed the lowest ethanol production among three strains at pH 7.0. The maximum ethanol concentration of 0.476 g/L was obtained by M. trichosporium OB3b, 4.25 times higher than the ethanol concentration of 0.112 g/L produced by Methylomonas sp.  DH-1.  Thus,  we  concluded  that M.  trichosporium OB3b  was  more suitable as a biocatalyst in ethane-to-ethanol production under the conditions analyzed. Figure 1.

Optimization of the Reaction Parameters in Batch Ethanol Production The effect of ethane concentration on ethanol production was investigated using 0.6 g DCW/L of M. trichosporium OB3b whole cells as the biocatalyst in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7) (Figure 2a). One mol of alkane and",
  "one mol of O2 participate in alcohol formation by pMMO. We expected that ethanol production would decrease when more than 20% ( v / v ) of ethane was injected, because approximately 17.4% ( v / v ) of ethane and 82.6% ( v / v ) of air were needed for maximum ethanol production, theoretically. However, the highest ethanol production was performed at 30% ( v / v ) of ethane concentration, and ethane supply of more than 0.288 mmol did not lead to an increase in ethanol accumulation. Excessive amounts of ethane greater than the theoretical value were required for maximum ethanol production. Similar results have been observed in previous experiments of methane-to-methanol  conversion  using M.  trichosporium OB3b  [23], Methylocella  tundrae [8],  and Methylomonas sp. DH-1 [25], in which the maximum methanol concentration was obtained when the supplied methane was more than 17% ( v / v ).  This result was probably due to the low solubility of methane [25]. The water solubility of methane,",
  "ethane, and dioxygen at 20 °C and 1 atm are 0.023 g/kg, 0.06 g/kg, and 0.045 g/kg, respectively, which correspond to 1.44 mM, 2.00 mM, and 1.41 mM, respectively [26]. The effect of pH on ethanol production in the presence of 30% ( v / v ) ethane is shown in Figure 2b. The ethanol concentration was the highest at pH 6 and sharply decreased above pH 7, indicating that MMO activity might be inhibited especially under alkaline conditions. In the previous studies of methane-to-methanol conversion by MMO, the optimal pH was around 7 [8,25,27,28]. In  order  to  assess  the  effect  of  biocatalyst  concentration  on  ethanol  formation,  various  cell concentrations from 0.15 to 4.8 g DCW/L were examined (Figure 2c). Ethanol formation increased with an increase in cell concentrations up to 2.4 g DCW/L and then decreased at 4.8 g DCW/L. While a higher biocatalyst loading brought rapid ethane conversion to ethanol, excessive biocatalyst loading over the optimum amount led to the decline of",
  "ethanol productivity. One possible explanation of this result would be that the amount of MDH inhibitor for 4.8 g/L cell concentration was not enough to completely inhibit the total activity  of  MDH in  the  given  reaction  condition.  With  respect  to  the economic aspects, the cell amount needs to be minimized. Thus, the optimal cell loading for ethaneto-ethanol conversion was determined to be 2.4 g/L in terms of cost and production efficiency.

The replenishment of NADH by supplying sodium formate increased the ethanol titer in ethane-to-ethanol conversion by",
  "transferring electrons to the MMO [21]. The formation of ethanol was enhanced as the formate concentration increased until 80 mM. However, formate concentration above 80 mM was not profitable for ethane oxidation and resulted in a decrease of ethanol concentration. This was probably due to the high concentration of Na-formate that causes the disruptions of intracytoplasmic membranes where pMMO binds [21]. An 80 mM formate was chosen for maximum ethanol production. 5 6 7 pH 0.15 0.3 0.6 1.2 2.4 4.8 Cell concentration (g/L) Figure 2.

Methanol was reported to be a competitive inhibitor of ethanol on MDH, but ethanol  was  not  efficiently  accumulated  by  using  methanol  as  an  MDH  inhibitor  [20].  EDTA, phosphate, MgCl2, NaCl, and NH4Cl have been used as MDH inhibitors in recent studies. Studies on methanol  production  using  methanotrophic  bacteria  from  methane  showed  that  EDTA  and phosphate demonstrate a relatively higher MDH inhibition effect than other inhibitors (MgCl2, NaCl, NH4Cl) [27]. On the basis of these results, EDTA and phosphate were used as MDH inhibitors in this study. The effect of the EDTA and phosphate concentration on ethanol accumulation was examined with 0-10 mM EDTA and 0-800 mM potassium phosphate buffer. Maximum ethanol concentrations of  0.33  and  0.45  g/L  were  obtained",
  "in  the  presence  of  2.4  g  DCW/L  with  the  supply  of  300  mM phosphate and 0.3 mM EDTA, respectively (Figure 4). Ethanol accumulation with the addition of 0.3 mM EDTA was 1.35 times higher than with 300 mM phosphate. A further increase of inhibitors over 0.3 mM EDTA or 300 mM phosphate resulted in a decrease of ethanol concentration. Cytochrome cL is  the  primary  electron  acceptor  of  MDH,  and  the  electron  is  expected  to  be  transferred  by  the coupling of lysyl residues on MDH surface and carboxyl groups of cytochrome cL. EDTA hinders the cytochrome from moving to the optimal position for the next electron transfer as it binds to MDH, which inhibits MDH activity [29]. In addition, EDTA can play a role in separating lipopolysaccharide and  protein  by  segregating  metal  ions  from  the  outer  membrane,  which  results  in  membrane destruction [30]. Thus, pMMO as a membrane-associated enzyme, can be dissociated and deactivated by a high concentration of EDTA.",
  "This is why concentrations above 0.3 mM EDTA reduce ethanol productivity. The decrease of ethanol concentration in the presence of more than 300 mM phosphate could be due to the depression of pMMO catalytic activity by intolerable phosphate concentrations [31]. The production of ethanol from ethane would be practiced on an enormous scale. The use of 300 mM phosphate as a means of retarding ethanol oxidation is not practical because of limited global phosphate reserves and environmental contamination [32]. We concluded that the addition of 0.3 mM EDTA was the most suitable alternative for efficient ethanol accumulation. Figure 4. Effects of the addition of EDTA ( a ) and phosphate ( b ) as MDH inhibitors on ethanol accumulation. To investigate the effect of the cell growth phase of methanotrophic cells used as biocatalysts on ethanol production, M. trichosporium OB3b was studied first (Figure 5a). When the initial inoculation concentration was OD600 of 0.07, the early exponential phase",
  "was started at OD600 of 0.6, the stationary phase at OD600 of 1.99 was reached after incubation for 33 h, and the OD600 value did not change significantly for 11 days. The amount of ethanol was measured when the concentration of the cells used as the biocatalyst corresponded to OD600 of 0.6, 1.0, 1.5, and 1.8 (between the exponential phase and the deceleration phase). As shown in Figure 5b, cells in different growth phases between 1.0 and 1.8 did not lead to a significant change in ethanol production, and the maximum concentration of ethanol was obtained using cells harvested at OD600 of 1.8. However, the highest conversion efficiency after 1 h of reaction was obtained using cells harvested at OD600 of 1.0, which produced ethanol at a concentration more than two times higher than that obtained using cells harvested at OD600 of 1.8. This result demonstrates that the cells in the middle exponential phase were more suitable for use as Molecules 2019 , 24 , 591 6  of  9 2.5 (a) 2.0 - ₴ 1.5",

Ethane-to-Ethanol Conversion under Optimized Batch Conditions The bioconversion of ethane to ethanol under optimized conditions was compared with that of the experiment conducted in the absence of 0.3 mM EDTA and 80 mM formate (Figure 6). When both EDTA and formate were not added, ethanol was not formed. The addition of formate accelerated ethanol  production,  and  the  supply  of  MDH  inhibitors  such  as  phosphate  and  EDTA  enhanced ethanol accumulation. The maximum ethanol titer of 0.52 g/L and",
  "volumetric productivity of 0.4 g/L/h were achieved from ethane using 2.4 g DCW/L methanotrophic resting cell with 0.3 mM EDTA and 80 mM formate in the batch reaction. These results are almost eight times and six times higher than those previously reported (approximately 0.067 g/L and 0.062 g/L/h) [20]. On  the  basis  of  thermodynamic  equilibrium  analysis  with  the  assumption  that  MDH  was completely  inhibited,  the  maximum  ethanol  titer  was  expected  to  be  1.1  g/L  under  the  optimal conditions.  However,  the  actual  ethanol  concentration  was  about  0.52  g/L  after  12  h  of  reaction, because the subsequent oxidation of ethanol into acetaldehyde affected the equilibrium (Figure 6). Considering the consumed amount of ethane, 1.17 g/L ethanol should be accumulated. Under the optimal  reaction  conditions,  0.52  g/L  ethanol,  0.44  g/L  acetaldehyde,  and  0.01  g/L  acetate  were accumulated after 12 h due to the incomplete inhibition of MDH (Figure 6). For",
  "complete inhibition of  MDH,  we  can  consider  the  option  of  increasing  the  MDH  inhibitor.  However,  a  high  MDH inhibitor concentration can have a negative effect on MMO activity as described above (Figure 4a). Figure 6.

This study demonstrates that methanotrophs possessing MMO activity could be used as",
  "biocatalysts for the biological conversion of ethane to ethanol, as an example of biological gas-to-liquid technology. 3. Materials and Methods 3.1. Bacterial Strains and Culture Conditions M. trichosporium OB3b, Methylomonas sp. DH-1, and M. alcaliphilum 20Z were utilized for ethanol production  from  ethane  as  biocatalysts.  Each  cell  type  was  cultured  in  500  mL  baffled  flasks containing 30% ( v / v ) methane and 50 mL of nitrate mineral salt (NMS) medium for Methylomonas sp. DH-1  [25], M.  trichosporium OB3b  (containing  5  μM  CuSO4)  [23],  and M.  alcaliphilum 20Z  [33], respectively. The organisms were cultured in a shaking incubator at 230 rpm and 30 °C. 3.2. Conversion of Ethanol from Ethane The ability of methanotrophs to produce ethanol from ethane was evaluated in 20 mL serum bottles. The grown cells were harvested by centrifugation at 4 °C, 9000× g for 20 min. The pelleted cells were rinsed twice with distilled water and reaction buffer (20 mM potassium",
  "phosphate). Resuspended whole cells (0.6 g DCW/L) with the reaction buffer were used as biocatalyst to convert ethane to ethanol. Solutions containing 40 mM formate and 0.5 mM EDTA were added to the reaction buffer in a reaction bottle. The bottle was sealed with a gray butyl rubber septum and an aluminum seal. The batch reactions were initiated by injecting 30% ( v / v ) ethane in the headspace and carried out in a shaking incubator at 230 rpm and 30 °C before being terminated by deactivating the biocatalysts using a heating block at 90 °C for 30 min. Subsequently, the concentrations of ethane in the headspace of the cooled samples and of ethanol in the reaction mixture were analyzed. All reactions were done in triplicate. 3.3. Analytical Method Ethane and ethanol were quantified by gas chromatography using a HP-Plot Q capillary column and a flame ionization detector (FID). For ethane analysis, the oven temperature was maintained at 100  °C  for  1  min  and  then  raised  to  150  °C",
  "at  a  rate  of  10  °C/min.  The  injector  and  detector temperatures were set at 250 °C and 230 °C, respectively. Nitrogen was used as a carrier gas and flowed at a rate of 2.0 mL/min. For ethanol quantification, the oven temperature was maintained at 200 °C. The injector and detector temperatures were set at 250 °C. The carrier gas flowed at a rate of 2.5 mL/min. Acetaldehyde and acetate were analyzed by HPLC with an Aminex HPX-87H column and  DA  detector.  Acetaldehyde  and  acetate  were  detected  at  270  nm  and  210  nm  wavelengths, respectively. The mobile phase was 5 mM H2SO4. 4. Conclusions Methanotrophs have been considered as promising biocatalysts for the conversion of gaseous alkane to liquid alcohol. In this study, we exploited them as the biocatalysts for ethane-to-ethanol conversion.  The  batch  bioconversion  conditions  for  ethanol  production  were  investigated  and optimized. As a result, the optimal conditions were obtained when using 2.4 g/L biocatalyst,",
  "30% ( v / v ) ethane, 80 mM sodium formate, and 0.3 mM EDTA. Bioethanol under the optimal conditions was produced with the maximum titer of 0.52 g/L and volumetric productivity of 0.4 g/L/h, respectively. Ethane was successfully converted to ethanol, without the generation of carbon dioxide, simply by employing methanotrophs as the biocatalyst and ethane as the substrate. This study demonstrates that methanotroph-catalyzed bioconversion can be applied for ethanol production from ethane as a biological gas-to-liquid technology.
