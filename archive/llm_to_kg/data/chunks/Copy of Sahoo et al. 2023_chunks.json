Sahoo et al. chemical  methods  to  catalytically  convert  the  greenhouse  gases  into useful chemicals, these chemical routes are constrained by the requirement of high-cost catalysts, extreme operating conditions such as high pressure and temperature, and release of noxious by-products (Sahoo et  al.,  2022,  2021).  There  have  been  reports  on  application  of  gas fermentation  technology  involving  microorganism-driven  biological routes to convert gaseous substances e.g., carbon dioxide, methane and carbon  monoxide  into  different  high-value  products  such  as  ethanol (Tang et al., 2021), succinic acid (Amulya et al., 2020), lipids and singlecell proteins (Rasouli et al., 2018), polyβ -hydroxybutyrate (Zhang et al., 2018, 2017) and bio-hydrogen (Zhao et al., 2011). From a contextual",
  "perspective, methanotrophs, a class of Gram-negative, methane oxidizing  bacteria,  are  being  explored  as  noble  platform  to  produce methanol  (a  potential  fuel).  Methanotrophs  uptake  methane  as  an obligate  source  for  the  derivation  of  carbon  and  energy.  Methane  is further  oxidised  into  methanol,  formaldehyde,  formic  acid,  and  CO2 through sequential catalysis by intracellular enzymes namely, methane monooxygenase  (MMO),  methanol  dehydrogenase  (MDH),  formaldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  formate  dehydroagenase,  respectively  (see supplementary materials). Except MMO, the set of other three enzymes are reversible in nature. Authors have reported methanol production through biological methane oxidation catalysed by MMO (Duan et al., 2011; Patel et al., 2020a). However, the methanol produced gets further oxidised into formaldehyde, formate and carbon dioxide by MDH and other enzymes, thereby, reducing the methanol titer. To overcome this, the activity of",
  "MDH is blocked through the addition of MDH inhibitor into  the  cultivation  media.  For  example,  Patel  et  al.  (2016b)  have demonstrated the effect of MgCl2, EDTA, NH4Cl, and NaCl, as MDH inhibitors for methanol production in Methylosinus sporium . Also, formate is  supplemented as a NADH source, which acts as a cofactor for the functioning of soluble MMO. Alternatively, certain methanotrophs ( e.g., M. trichosporium and M. sporium ) have been reported as biocatalysts for methanol  production  through  biological  CO2  reduction  (Patel  et  al., 2016a; Sahoo et al., 2022). CO2 being the metabolic end-product, when fed to the cells in excess concentration, drives the equilibrium in reverse direction. Owing to the irreversible nature of the MMO, this route leads to  the  extracellular  secretion  of  methanol  as  the  end-product.  The reduction of CO2 is powered by the presence of PHB reserves, which act as  a  source  of  reducing  equivalent  in  addition  to  NADH  (Xin  et",
  "al., 2007). Therefore, the conversion of methane and CO2  into methanol adopt different routes. While the methanol production from biological oxidation of methane requires higher MMO activity coupled with the inhibition  of  MDH  activity;  methanol  production  from  biological reduction  of  CO2  requires  higher  activity  of  formate  dehydrogenase, formaldehyde  dehydrogenase  and  methanol  dehydrogenase,  without any  involvement  of  MMO.  MMO  oxidises  methane  into  methanol. Hence, the activity of MMO in presence of methane has been correlated to  methanol  production,  since  the  methanol  titer  decreases  with  the decrease in MMO activity (Patel et al., 2020a, 2020b). However, the presence of CO2  is known to shift the equilibrium of methanotrophic metabolic  reaction  in  reverse  direction,  thereby  rendering  the ' irreversible enzyme MMO ' non-functional (Sahoo et al., 2021). Methanol production from greenhouse gases overcomes the problem of  biomass  limitation",
  "as  is  suffered  in  case  of  first-  and  secondgeneration  biofuel  production  processes  ( e.g. ,  bioethanol,  biodiesel), which rely on agricultural crops or lignocellulosic feedstocks (Verhelst et al., 2019). Moreover, unlike other microbial processes, which utilize costly carbon sources such as glucose, fructose, xylose, etc. as substrates, this  process  only  uses  waste  greenhouse  gases  (CO2 and/or  CH4), thereby reducing the operational expenses (Sahoo et al., 2021). Sahoo et al. (2022) reported a two-stage integrated process for methanol production. The process involves utilization of methane in the first stage to produce methanotrophic biomass, while carbon dioxide is utilized in the second stage to produce methanol using the biomass as biocatalyst. Also, researchers have adopted recent strategies in methanol production by methanotrophs using low-cost feed (biogas) derived through anaerobic digestion and dark-fermentation of biowastes as an alternative to pure gas",
  "(Patel et al., 2023, 2022). However, one of the key challenges in the biological process for methanol synthesis from methane and CO2 is the low titer of the biomass and methanol, which is primarily attributed to inferior mass transfer rates and limited solubility of the gaseous substrates in the liquid medium (Sahoo et al., 2022, 2021). Process engineering strategies from the perspective of suitable reactor configuration and design, supplementation of exogenous mass transfer vectors and application  of  elevated  pressure,  are  potential  approaches  towards combating the hurdles associated with limited mass transfer and solubility.  Airlift  reactors  are  considered  to  be  advantageous  over  other reactor  configurations  attributed  to  better  mixing  and  mass  transfer, greater  liquid  recirculation  and  gas  hold-up,  absence  of  mechanical agitation  and  lower  power  requirement  (Doran,  1995).  Researchers have reported the application of airlift bioreactors for the",
  "cultivation of methanotrophic biomass towards the enhancement of methane biodegradation and methanol production through direct oxidation of methane (Ghaz-Jahanian et al., 2018; Rocha-Rios et al., 2011). Reactor design aspects, especially from the point of view of design of sparger and configuration  of  draft  tube  in  an  airlift  reactor  hold  a  significant importance in defining the reactor performance characteristics when the reactions occurring inside the system are limited by mass transfer phenomena.  Spargers  predominantly  play  key  role  in  generation  and dispersion of gases in the form of bubbles. In contrast to conventional spargers which generate coarse bubbles, micro-spargers lead to generation of fine microbubbles, characterized by higher specific interfacial area (larger ratio of surface area to volume) and thus, offers improvement  in  volumetric  mass  transfer  coefficient  (Hanotu  et  al.,  2017). Another key distinguishing feature of an airlift reactor is",
  "the draft tube. Draft tubes have been reported to improve circulation and axial mixing inside  the  reactor.  Moreover,  the  draft  tube  induces  a  unidirectional pattern  of  liquid  circulation  leading  to  unidirectional  movement  of bubbles, and consequent reduction in bubble coalescence (Duan and Shi, 2014). The limited solubility of gaseous substrates in liquid medium is yet another hurdle associated with gas fermentation. The maximum solubility of CO2 in water 0.874 mol percent at a temperature and pressure of 373.15 K and 5.03 MPa, respectively (Lucile et al., 2012). Whereas, at the same temperature, the highest solubility of methane in water is 6 × 10 -3 mole percent at a pressure of 10 MPa (Pruteanu et al., 2017). Mass transfer vectors, a class of organic solvents are reported to enhance the solubility  of  gaseous  substances  in  the  liquid  medium.  For  instance, paraffin oil and silicone oil are reported to enhance the bioavailability of methane and oxygen to the",
  "cells (Han et al., 2009; Rocha-Rios et al., 2009).  This  could  be  attributed  to  the  fact  that  relative  to  aqueous mineral  salt  media,  mass  transfer  vectors  possess  greater  affinity  for oxygen and methane. This increased dissolution of gases upon vector supplementation in the media has been reported to have positive influence not only on the production of biomass (Han et al., 2009), but also on methanol (Patel et al., 2020b). For instance, Patel et al. (2020b) reported 1.7-fold increment in methanol production by adding methane vectors to methanotrophic culture as compared to control. Similarly, Patel et al. (2023) reported a residual methanol production efficacy of 28.3 % in presence of paraffin oil as methane vector, as compared to 13.4 % in control, after 6 cycles of biomass reuse. Moreover, the supplementation of methane vectors has shown to enhance the biocatalytic activity of MMO. For instance, Patel et al. (2023) reported residual MMO activity of 37.4 % in",
  "presence of paraffin oil relative to 16.9 % in case of control after 6 cycles of biomass reuse. Furthermore, elevated operating pressure has been reported to be a suitable strategy towards enhancing the solubility of gaseous substrates in various microbial gas fermentation systems (Van Hecke et al., 2019). However, the lower mass transfer and limited solubility of methane and carbon dioxide in methanotrophic gas fermentation still presents a major bottleneck, exerting a limiting impact on the titers and productivities of biomass and methanol.

Further,  conversion  of  carbon  dioxide  to  methanol  was carried out under elevated operating pressures in a customized highpressure stirred tank reactor to achieve better solubility of carbon dioxide and in turn improved methanol titer. The employment of these process engineering strategies resulted in increments of 126 %, 148 % and 241 %, in biomass titer, methane fixation rate and methanol titer, respectively, as compared to the previous study in semi-batch stirred tank reactor (Sahoo et al., 2022). 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Organism and culture conditions Methylosinus  trichosporium NCIMB  11131  was  obtained  from  National Collection of Industrial Food and Marine Bacteria, and was grown on nitrate mineral salt (NMS) medium containing (g L -1 ): KNO3  (1.0), Na2HPO4 ⋅ 12H2O (0.306), KH2PO4",
  "(0.111), MgSO4 ⋅ 6H2O (1.0), CaCl2 (0.2),  Fe-EDTA (0.0038) and Na2MoO4 ⋅ 2H2O (0.00026). Trace metal solution (1 mL) comprising of (g L -1 ): CuSO4 ⋅ 5H2O (0.15), FeSO4 ⋅ 7H2O (0.375),  ZnSO4 ⋅ 7H2O  (0.3),  H3BO3  (0.01125),  CoCl2 ⋅ 6H2O  (0.0375), EDTA di-sodium  salt  (0.1875),  MnCl2 ⋅ 4H2O (0.015)  and  NiCl2 ⋅ 6H2O (0.0075) was added to the media. Medium pH was calibrated to 6.8 by adding 1 M H2SO4 and 1 M NaOH. Milli-Q water (18 M Ω ) was used to prepare all the reagents. All the chemicals were of analytical grade and bought from Himedia and other commercial suppliers. Inoculum preparation was carried out as described previously (Sahoo et al., 2022) by cultivating the cells in 100 mL of NMS medium in customized air-tight bottles. Cultures were incubated in a shaker incubator (ORBITEK, Scigenics Biotech) at 30 ◦ C and 150 rpm with intermittent sparging of air and  methane.  The  cells  from  mid-log  phase  culture  with  an  optical density (A600) of 5.0 were used as inoculum",
  "(10 % v/v concentration) for all experiments. 2.2. Growth of methanotrophs using methane as sole carbon source in customized airlift bioreactor Generation of methanotrophic biomass was carried out in the first stage  of  two-stage  integrated  process  using  methane  as  sole  carbon source. The strain M. trichosporium was evaluated for its growth using micro-sparger with varying pore size, use of draft tube and presence of mass transfer vectors. All the experiments were carried out in customized airlift bioreactor using optimized NMS media at room temperature and the culture was sparged continuously with methane-air mixture. The concentration of methane in the inlet gas stream and the gas flow rate were maintained at 2.5 % v/v and 0.5 vvm, respectively (Sahoo et  al.,  2022).  Samples  were  collected  at  an  interval  of  8  h  to  obtain dynamic profiles of growth. kLa for oxygen and methane were estimated as  described  later  in  the  Section  2.2.3.  Methane  fixation  rate",
  "was calculated using Eq. (1) (Sahoo et al., 2022) where Px is  the  biomass  productivity  (g/L  d -1 ), Ec is  the  content  of elemental carbon in the biomass. 16 and 12 are molecular weight of methane and carbon, respectively. 2.2.1. Design of airlift reactor A laboratory-scale (Total volume: 700 mL, working volume: 500 mL) internal loop airlift reactor was constructed from clear polycarbonate sheet  with  a  total  height  of  23.5  cm,  and  the  inner  diameter  of  the column being 7 cm (Fig. 1a). A draft tube with a total height of 22.5 cm and  inner  diameter  of  4  cm  was  mounted  coaxially  attached  to  the headplate. Three rectangular openings (5 cm × 1.5 cm) were provided in the upper portion of the draft tube, and a clearance of 1 cm between the lower rim of the draft tube and the bottom of the reactor column for allowing the circulation of the liquid through the riser and the downcomer sections. The reactor column contained a gas separator section at the  top  with",
  "a  height  of  2.5  cm  and  an  inner  diameter  of  10  cm  to facilitate liquid recirculation and bubble disengagement. Gaseous substrates (mixture of air and methane) were introduced into the reactor column through a removable sintered metal gas sparger attached to the centre of the reactor bottom below the draft tube. The cross-sectional channel inside the draft tube, and the annulus between the draft tube and the reactor column, were used as the riser and the downcomer, respectively.  Ports  were  provided  on  the  headplate  for  exhaust  and placement of DO probe. 2.2.2. Effect of sparger pore size, draft tube and mass transfer vector on growth of the strain Sintered metal micro-spargers with a height of 2.67 cm and diameter of 1.5 cm were customized for the airlift reactor for the given pore sizes: 5, 10, 40, 70 and 100 µ m. The growth characterisation of the strain was carried  out  in  the  customized  airlift  reactor  equipped  with  microspargers  of  varying  pore",
  "sizes  (5 -100 µ m).  In  the  next  step,  the growth characterization was performed in the absence of draft tube, where draft tube mounting was not provided in the headplate. The effect of  mass  transfer  vector  was  assessed  by  supplementing  varying  concentrations  (5 -10  %  v/v)  of  two  different  organic  solvents  such  as paraffin oil and silicone oil in the cultivation medium. 2.2.3. Estimation of kLa for oxygen and methane Volumetric  mass  transfer  coefficient  for  oxygen  ( kLaO 2 )  was  estimated using the gas out -gas in unsteady-state mass balance method for oxygen, as described earlier by Ghaz-Jahanian et al. (2018). Change in the concentration of oxygen in the culture media was measured using dissolved  oxygen  (DO)  probe  (METTLER  TOLEDO,  Switzerland). Initially, deoxygenation of NMS media was carried out by purging nitrogen  into  the  reactor  until  the  DO  concentration  dropped  to  zero. Subsequently,  the  media  was  reoxygenated  by  purging",
  "air  into  the reactor at a uniform flow rate of 0.5 vvm. The variation in DO concentration (Ct) during reoxygenation was recorded as a function of time, and continued until the DO concentration reached a steady-state value ( C ) . The rate of change in DO concentration is equal to the rate of oxygen transfer from gas to liquid. Therefore, dCt dt = kLaO 2 ( C -Ct) (2)where Ct is the DO concentration at time t, and ( C ) is the steady-state DO concentration. Integrating Eq. (2) between t1 and t2 results in: time points t1 and t2, and kLaO 2 is the slope obtained by plotting ln ( C GLYPH<0> Ct 1 ) ( C GLYPH<0> Ct 2 ) against  time.  The  volumetric  mass  transfer  coefficient  for  methane ( kLaCH 4 )  was  calculated using  the  value  of kLaO 2 as  per  the  equation reported by Ghaz-Jahanian et al. (2018) for upcoming bubbles in airlift bioreactor: where Vm is the molecular volume, which is 25.6 and 37.9 cm 3  gmol GLYPH<0> 1 for  oxygen  and methane, respectively.  Thus, based on",
  "the molecular volumes of oxygen and methane, kLaCH 4 was calculated from kLaO 2 using Eq. (5). It  should  be  noted  that,  Eq.

Conversion of carbon dioxide into methanol using biomass as biocatalyst: Effect of",
  "operating pressure The methanotrophic biomass generated in the first stage of the integrated process was used as biocatalyst for conversion of carbon dioxide to methanol under varying operating pressure. A laboratory-scale stirred  tank  reactor  with  a  maximum  working  volume  of  1.2  L  was fabricated using SS-316-grade stainless steel with a total height of 22 cm and an outer diameter of 11.4 cm (Fig. 1b). The reactor was designed to withstand pressure as high as up to 10 bar. The reactor was equipped with  six-bladed  Rushton  disk  turbine  impeller  for  efficient  mixing, temperature detector, pressure gauge, pressure release valve and ports for gas feeding and sampling. The culture was assessed for methanol production under varying headspace pressure of 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 bar. The CO2  concentration in the headspace and liquid to headspace volume ratio were maintained at 50 % v/v and 10:90, respectively, based on the results obtained from previous study (Sahoo et al., 2022).",
  "The desired pressure in the headspace was achieved by injecting a mixture of CO2 and air in the beginning of the batch using rotameters. The reactor was operated at room temperature and 150 rpm. In this step, the harvested biomass (3.39 g L -1 ) was resuspended in 20 mM phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) containing 5 mM MgCl2 (Sahoo et al., 2022). Sampling was carried out at regular time intervals to obtain dynamic profiles for methanol production and growth. 2.4. Analytical methods Cell growth was estimated by measuring the absorbance at 600 nm (A600)  using  UV -Vis  spectrophotometer  (Cary  Series  100,  Agilent Technologies).  The  absorbance  values  were  converted  into  dry  cell weight (DCW) using the correlation, one optical density = 0.42 g dry cells L -1 (R 2 = 0.99). Sample was centrifuged (HERAEUS, MULTIFUGE X3R Centrifuge, Thermo Scientific) at 10,000 rpm for 15 min to obtain cell-free  supernatant  for  the  estimation  of  methanol  titer.  Methanol concentration in the sample",
  "was estimated by high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Ultimate 3000, Dionex, Thermofisher Scientific,  Germany)  in  refractive  index  detector  (RID)  using  Rezex  ROA column (300 × 7.8 mm, Phenomenex) and 0.005 N H2SO4  as mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.5 mL min GLYPH<0> 1 .  Refractive index detector and column oven were kept at 37 ◦ C and room temperature, respectively. Elemental composition (C, H, and N) of the biomass was obtained using CHNS  analyser  (EuroEA  Elemental  Analyser).  Statistical  significance was  evaluated  through  one-way  ANOVA  with  the  help  of  MINITAB software at 95 % confidence interval. 3. Results and discussion Methanol production was carried out in a sequential two-stage integrated process, as described earlier (Sahoo et al., 2022). In brief, the first  stage  involved  production  of  methanotrophic  biomass  through utilization  of  methane  as  carbon  source,  while  the  second  stage encompassed reduction of carbon dioxide to",

(2011) reported that in an internal loop airlift reactor while a 2-orifice nozzle (pore diameter: 2.6 mm) resulted in a kLa of 0.0018  s GLYPH<0> 1 (6.48  h GLYPH<0> 1 ),  a  4-orifice  nozzle  (pore  diameter:  1.84  mm) resulted in a much higher kLa of 0.0023 s GLYPH<0> 1 (8.28 h GLYPH<0> 1 ), suggesting that spargers  with  lesser  pore  sizes  generate  bubbles  with  lower  mean diameter, and thus are associated with greater specific interfacial area and  liquid  circulation  velocity,  consequently  leading  to  a  relatively higher kLa . A similar study in an external loop airlift reactor reported 550 % improvement in kLa with a sinter plate sparger with mean pore diameter of 115 μ m, as compared to a single orifice sparger with a pore size  of  4  mm  (Luki ´ c  et  al.,  2017).  Sintered-type  spargers  reportedly produce very stable and smaller bubbles, and generate a bubbly flow regime",
  "along  with  prolonged  bubble  residence  time,  resulting  in  an improved kLa (Luki ´ c et al., 2017). The findings of the present study align well  in  accordance  with  these  literature  reports,  thus  signifying  the importance of smaller pore sizes in spargers towards enhancing the mass transfer in airlift reactors. 3.1.2. Evaluation of the effect of engagement of draft tube In order to evaluate the effect of engagement of draft tube in airlift reactor, the growth of the organism was assessed with and without the placement  of  draft  tube  in  the  reactor  equipped  with  5µ m  microsparger.  The  biomass  titer  was  found  to  decrease  by  8.59  %  in  the absence of the draft tube, i.e. , from 6.4 ± 0.26 g/L to 5.85 ± 0.18 g/L (Fig. 3a). Additionally, the values of kLaO 2 and kLaCH 4 were observed to decrease by 27.4 % each (Fig. 3b). Likewise, biomass productivity and methane  fixation  rate  showed  decrements  of  13.3  %  and  13.4  %, respectively, in the absence of",
  "the draft tube (Fig. 3c). These experimental  observations  emphasized  the  indispensable  requirement  for placement of draft tube in the airlift reactor towards achieving improved mass  transfer  coefficient,  and  consequent  augmentations  in  biomass titer, biomass productivity and methane fixation rate. The presence of draft tube in an airlift  reactor  divides  the  vessel longitudinally into riser and downcomer sections. Bubbles rise inside the riser section causing vertical flow of the liquid in upward direction. This upward force exerted in the riser section is counter-balanced by vertical downflow of the liquid inside the downcomer section (Duan and Shi, 2014). The up-flow and downflow of the liquid result in efficient circulation and mixing of the liquid. Improved liquid circulation imparts a uniform velocity to the bubbles causing them to traverse in uniform direction. This kind of flow pattern has been reported to consequently minimize the probability of bubble",
  "coalescence and improve the kLa . Researchers have highlighted the significance of draft tube in controlling the mass transfer and the hydrodynamic behaviour of airlift reactor. For instance, Hekmat et al. (2010) outlined that draft tube facilitated the circulation of liquid through a complete cycle inside the reactor, and out  in  customized  airlift  bioreactor.  Certain  approaches  from  the perspective of reactor design, such as, use of micro-sparger and placement of draft tube, along with another process engineering strategy, i.e. , exogenous addition of mass transfer vector, were applied to the airlift reactor. Subsequently, characterisation was carried out to evaluate the consequent  impact  on kLa ,  biomass  titer,  biomass  productivity  and methane fixation rate. 112 128 144 160 0 5 um 10 um 40 mm Pore size 3.1.1. Evaluation of the effect of varying pore sizes of micro-sparger Design of the sparger plays a critical role in delineating the performance characteristics of",
  "airlift reactors, where there are no other moving parts to ensure adequate mass transfer of gaseous substrates in liquid media.  In  this  regard,  the  pore  size  of  the  sparger  holds  significant importance, as the size of the pores on sparger regulate the size of the bubbles generating thereof, which in turn impact the volumetric mass transfer  coefficient based on the characteristic interfacial area of the generated bubbles. To that end, characterisation of the organism was carried out using micro-spargers of various pore sizes ranging from 5 to 100 µ m. Biomass titer was found to increase linearly from 4.54 ± 0.16 to 6.4 ± 0.26 g/L with the decrease in pore size of the micro-sparger from 100 to 5 µ m (Fig. 2a). Similarly, the highest kLa for oxygen and methane of 78.1 ± 1.6 and 69.4 ± 1.4 h GLYPH<0> 1 , respectively, were obtained using the micro-sparger  of  5 µ m  pore  size  (Fig.  2b),  which  was  a  27-fold improvement  over  the  values  of kLa obtained  using  100 µ m",
  "microsparger. Furthermore, the maximum biomass productivity and methane fixation rate with 5µ m micro-sparger were estimated to be 1.27 ± 0.04 and 0.69 ± 0.02 g/L d -1 , respectively (Fig. 2c). Spargers with larger pore sizes are known to generate larger or coarse bubbles associated  with  lower  volumetric  mass  transfer  coefficient  (Hanotu et al., 2017; Luki ´ c et al., 2017). On the other hand, with the reduction in the pore size, micro-spargers (with pore sizes in the range of micrometres)  generate  even  finer  microbubbles,  characterized  by  higher specific interfacial area (larger ratio of surface area to volume), leading to improvement in kLa ,  lower probability of bubble coalescence, and greater residence time inside the reactor. Moreover, in contrast to coarse bubbles, microbubbles are known to impart greater degree of aggregate convective force, consequently leading to a thoroughly mixed homogenous liquid phase (Hanotu et al., 2017). AL-Mashhadani et al. (2015)",
  "reported  that  the  reduction  in  the  size  of  microbubbles  promoted downward  penetration  of  gas  bubbles  through  an  increased  vertical depth into the downcomer section, owing to an intensification in the downward  drag  force  relative  to  the  buoyant  force,  thus  inducing greater  liquid  recirculation  and  mixing  efficiency.  Therefore,  the improvement in biomass titer, biomass productivity and methane fixation rate with the decrease in the pore size of the micro-sparger could be attributed to the increase in mass transfer and mixing with 5µ m microsparger, and the consequent upsurge in the availability of methane to the cells.

(2020) reported that the geometric configuration of draft tube has notable influence on gas hold-up, gas residence time and mass transfer, which in turn regulate the power efficiency of airlift reactors. Authors have even reported 40 -100 % improvement in kLa with the installation of draft tube in conventional mechanically agitated stirred tank reactor (Lueske et al., 2015). These",
  "literature reports in line with the present experimental results fairly justify the role of draft tube in airlift reactors for attaining improved performance. 3.1.3. Evaluation of the effect of supplementation of mass transfer vector To overcome the limited solubility of methane and oxygen in NMS media, and increase their  bioavailability  to  the  cells,  the  media  was supplemented with mass transfer vectors. M. trichosporium growth was evaluated under 0 -10 % v/v of paraffin oil and silicone oil. While, the absence of mass transfer vector (control) resulted in 6.4 ± 0.26 g L -1 of biomass titer, the addition of 5 % v/v paraffin oil yielded an improved titer of 7.2 ± 0.29 g L -1 after 136 h of cultivation. With further increase in  the  concentration  of  paraffin  oil  to  10  %  v/v,  the  biomass  titer reduced marginally to 7 ± 0.31 g L -1 (Fig. 4a). Similar observations have also been reported by Han et al. (2009), where at the end of 170 h of cultivation of M. trichosporium ,",
  "the biomass titer obtained in the control was 2 g L -1 ,  which increased to 6 g L -1 with the addition of 5 % v/v paraffin oil, and dropped to 1.8 g L -1 with further increase in the concentration to 10 % v/v. These observations point towards the improved performance of M. trichosporium in the present study in airlift reactor under similar concentrations of paraffin oil. Furthermore, the biomass titer improved with the increase in the concentration of silicone oil from 5 % v/v, and reached a maximum titer of 7.68 ± 0.31 g L -1 at 10 % v/v (Fig. 4a). Thus, under the supplementation of 10 % v/v silicone oil, the biomass titer achieved for M. trichosporium in airlift reactor was significantly  higher  than  that  obtained  for  methanotrophic  consortium ( 0 . 004 × 10 GLYPH<0> 9 g  L -1 )  in  two-phase  partition  trickling  bed  reactor (Rocha-Rios et al., 2009). Furthermore, the performance characteristics of the airlift reactor also  improved  under  the  chosen  concentration  of",
  "the  mass  transfer vector.  For  instance,  with  the  addition  of  10  %  v/v  silicone  oil,  the highest values of kLa obtained for oxygen and methane in airlift reactor were 98.5 ± 2.5 and 87.5 ± 2.2 h GLYPH<0> 1 , respectively (Fig. 4b), which were remarkably higher than that obtained for stirred tank reactor ( 0.011 s GLYPH<0> 1 or 39.6 h GLYPH<0> 1 ) operated at 500 rpm with the same concentration of silicone oil (Rocha-Rios et al., 2010). Similarly, the maximum biomass productivity and methane fixation rate with 10 % v/v silicone oil were estimated to be 1.46 ± 0.04 and 0.80 ± 0.02 g L -1 d -1 , respectively (Fig. 4c). As compared to aqueous mineral salt media, mass transfer vectors have been  reported  to  possess  greater  affinity  for  oxygen  and  methane (Rocha-Rios et al., 2009). The addition of 10 % v/v silicone oil to the fermentation media resulted in 26 % increment each in kLaO 2 and kLaCH 4 , relative  to  the  control  (without  any  vector  supplementation).",
  "This improvement in gas-to-liquid mass transfer rate could be accountable for increase  in  the  dissolution  of  gases  in  the  fermentation  media,  and enhancement in the delivery of oxygen and methane to the cells thereof (Patel  et  al.,  2020b).  The  improved  bioavailability  of  these  gases consequently  led  to  increments  of  20  %  in  biomass  titer,  14.7  %  in biomass productivity and 14.6 % in methane fixation rate as compared to the control. Methane available to the cells is oxidized into methanol and  subsequently  into  formaldehyde,  formic  acid,  and  CO2.  Biomass formation occurs as result of the assimilation of a part of the intermediately produced formate or formaldehyde as carbon source via RuMP or serine  pathway  (Sahoo  et  al.,  2021).  Therefore,  in  addition  to  mass Fig. 4.

This is the first study presenting a combinatorial approach of design of micro-sparger, engagement of draft tube and supplementation of mass transfer vector in an airlift reactor towards achieving improved biomass production and methane sequestration in methanotrophic cultivation system.  Altogether,  under",
  "the  application  of  these  specified  process engineering strategies in airlift  reactor,  the  present  study  showed  an improvement of 126 % in biomass titer, 143 % biomass productivity, and 148 % in methane fixation rate, as compared to the previous work carried out in a semi-batch stirred tank reactor (Sahoo et al., 2022). In general, airlift reactors are preferable over stirred tank reactors owing to the absence of mechanical moving parts, and thereby providing a low shear stress environment for cultivation of cells, accompanied by the advantage of relatively minimal energy requirement (Lechowska et al., 2019; Teli and Mathpati, 2021). Moreover, airlift reactors have been reported to exhibit better performance as compared to stirred tank reactors particularly in case of high cell density cultures which are susceptible to poor mixing and mass transfer limitations (AL-Mashhadani et al., 2015). For instance, under selected process parameters in internal loop airlift reactor",
  "(present study), the highest kLaCH 4 (87.5 ± 2.2 h GLYPH<0> 1 ) attained was 460-folds greater than that was previously estimated in case of semi-batch stirred tank reactor (0.19 h GLYPH<0> 1 ) (Sahoo et al., 2022). In addition to kLaCH 4 , the highest value of kLaO 2 (98.5 ± 2.5 h GLYPH<0> 1 ) achieved in this study was also found to be higher than trickle-bed reactor ( kLaO 2 : 9.54 h GLYPH<0> 1 , Sheets et al., 2017) and methane transfer chamber coupledexternal loop airlift reactor ( kLaO 2 :  97.2 h GLYPH<0> 1 , kLaCH 4 :  70.8 h GLYPH<0> 1 ,  GhazJahanian et al., 2018), reported for the cultivation of methanotrophs to produce methanol through biological oxidation of methane. 3.2. Process engineering strategies for improved methanol production in second stage The effect of elevated pressure on methanol production from CO2 was investigated under varying absolute pressure in the reactor headspace ranging from 1 to 5 bar. The methanol concentration was observed to increase",
  "concomitantly with the increase in absolute pressure from 1 bar, and attained a maximum value of 1.98 ± 0.08 g/L (61.8 ± 2.5 mM) at 4 bar (Fig. 5), which was a 235.6 % increment over the titer obtained under  atmospheric  pressure  (0.59 ± 0.03  g/L).  This  remarkable improvement in methanol titer could be attributed to the increase in the Fig.  5. Methanol  titer  under  varying  operating  pressures  in  high-pressure stirred  tank  reactor.  Significant  differences  (p ≤ 0.05)  were  noted  through statistical analysis using one-way ANOVA. availability  of  CO2 in  the  media  under  elevated  pressure  condition. Authors  have  reported  that  elevated  pressure  can  exert  significant impact on microbial cells at molecular level including enzymatic activity,  cell  permeability,  protein  structure  and  synthesis  of  metabolic products (Amulya et al., 2020). This in turn can potentially induce the development of specific genetic, physiological and/or metabolic phenotypes in",
  "the microorganism, with consequent effect on the pattern of product formation. Stoichiometrically, one mole of CO2 can produce one mole of methanol. So, when 50 % v/v CO2 concentration is maintained inside the 2 L reactor (with 90 % headspace volume), the amount of CO2 fed equals to 160.7 mmol (7.07 g). Theoretically, this can produce 160.7 mmol of methanol. However, the observed yield of methanol was 1.98 g/L (corresponding to an amount of 0.4 g or 12.5 mmol) (see supplementary materials). Based on the amount of methanol produced, the percentage of CO2 fixed (as extracellularly secreted methanol) at 4 bar was estimated to be 7.7 %. This could be attributed to the utilization of remaining  CO2 as  formate,  formaldehyde  or  methanol  (formed  via reduction), and assimilation into the biomass towards cell maintenance. Another possibility might be the limited biocatalytic potential of the cells to reduce CO2 in reverse direction of equilibrium. Researchers have reported similar studies",
  "demonstrating the effect of elevated pressure on product metabolism in other microbial systems. Kim et al. (2017) reported a threefold increment in H2 production from carbon monoxide at 4 bar in Thermococcus onnurineus NA1. Roger et al. (2018) reported 20-fold increase in formate production from a mixture of CO2  and H2  at 10 bar in genetically modified Escherichia coli K12. Lopes et al. (2009) reported 3.7-fold enhancement in lipase productivity at 5 bar in Yarrowia lipolytica W29. However, this is first study investigating the effect of elevated pressure on methanol production from CO2 using methanotrophic biomass as biocatalyst. Further increase in the absolute pressure above 4 bar resulted in significant reduction in methanol titer to 1.7 ± 0.05 g/L. This observation could be attributed to the integrated effect of high pressure and high volume of CO2  available per unit volume of the methanotrophic culture, imposing plausible inhibitory effect on electron transport chain, carbon",
  "metabolism and enzyme activity (Sahoo et al., 2022). In general, higher CO2 pressure beyond 4 -5 bar has been reported to hinder the cell viability in certain Type II methanotrophic species (Wendlandt et al., 1993). Moreover, M. trichosporium specifically being a Gram-negative organism is possibly more vulnerable to phospholipid solubilisation in the cell membrane due to the lack of thick peptidoglycan layer under higher  CO2  pressure  stress  (Schulz  et  al.,  2012).  Methanol  titer  was found to increase gradually till 24th h of the batch, after which a slight decline  was  observed.  This  could  be  attributed  to  the  exhaustion  of endogenous reducing equivalents ( e.g., NADH and PHB), or methanol degradation  owing  to  enzymatic  or  non-enzymatic  interactions  (Xin et al., 2007). Biomass density almost remained constant in the pressure range of 1 to 4 bar. However, it was observed to decline slightly at 5 bar with  the  progression  of  the  batch,  which  could  be",
  "another  possible reason for reduced methanol titer at this pressure (see supplementary materials). There  are  very  few  studies  reporting  the  production  of  methanol from the reduction of CO2 in methanotrophs under atmospheric pressure (Patel  et  al.,  2016a;  Xin  et  al.,  2007).  A  previous  study  reported  a maximum methanol titer of 0.58 g/L (18.10 mM) using Methylosinus trichosporium as biocatalyst, which was till date the highest methanol titer achieved through biological CO2 reduction pathway (Sahoo et al., 2022). In the present study, the elevation of operating pressure up to 4 bar resulted in further 3.4-fold increment in methanol production as compared to the previous report. Methanol production through CO2 reduction is carried out in phosphate buffer medium to resist major changes in pH resulting from CO2 solubility (Sahoo et al., 2022; Patel et al., 2016a; Xin et al., 2007). In the present study, the initial and final pH (at the end of the batch) of the culture",
  "were found to decrease from 6.8 ± 0.14 to 6.65 ± 0.13, and 6.56 ± 0.1 to 6.14 ± 0.09, respectively, with the increase in pressure from 1 G Bioresource Technology 371 (2023) 128603 K.K. Sahoo et al. bar to 5 bar (see supplementary materials). The slight decrease in pH with the progression of the batch and the increase in pressure, could be attributed to the increase in solubility of CO2. However, the use of buffer did help in resisting sharp and major decline in pH with the increasing CO2 solubility. Alternatively,  authors  have  reported  the  production  of  methanol through biological oxidation of methane by methanotrophs. However, this specific route is constrained by further sequential oxidation of the produced methanol into subsequent intermediate metabolites, and the requirement  for  methanol  dehydrogenase  inhibitors  and  formate  to achieve extracellular secretion of methanol into the media (Sahoo et al., 2022). Despite several attempts to enhance methanol production via",
  "biological oxidation of methane, the maximum methanol titer achieved is  limited  to  a  range  of  5.37 -52.9 mM (0.17 -1.69 g/L) (Patel et al., 2020a, 2016a). Duan et al. (2011) reported a maximum methanol titer of 1.12 g/L and Yp/x (methanol yield coefficient relative to biomass) of 0.066,  through  biological  oxidation  of  methane  using  a  very  high biomass density of M. trichosporium (17 g/L dry cell weight), high concentrations of methanol dehydrogenase inhibitors (400 mM phosphate and 10 mM MgCl2) and paraffin oil as mass transfer vector. Another study reported the production of methanol from methane through covalent immobilisation of Methylocystis bryophila cells  on  coconut coir using  paraffin  oil  as  mass  transfer  vector  (Patel  et  al.,  2020a).  The subsequent application of repeated batch strategy to this process resulted in a maximum cumulative methanol accumulation of 52.9 mM (1.69 g/L), with a Yp/x  value of 0.56 at the end of eight cycles of biomass",
  "reutilisation. On the contrary, the Yp/x in stirred tank reactor, operated in batch mode at 4 bar, was estimated to be 0.6 in the present study, signifying the ameliorated performance of the organism under elevated operating pressure, which is a much simpler strategy relative to other contemporary approaches. Therefore, in the current study, the methanol production attained through biological CO2 reduction, both in terms of titer and yield, was found to be much higher than other studies reported in literature concerned with biological methane oxidation. A comparative table for methanol production under different process conditions and reactor types has been provided (see supplementary materials). Biocatalytic activity of methanotrophic enzymes plays a vital role in determining the bioconversion yield of greenhouse gases to methanol. Increased methanol production from methane oxidation is associated with higher activity of MMO and reduced activity of MDH to facilitate the oxidation of",
  "methane to methanol, and limit the sequential oxidation of  methanol  into  other  intermediate  metabolites,  respectively.  For instance, Patel et al. (2020a) correlated the enhanced methanol production in M. bryophila cells under optimum conditions with increased relative MMO activity of 108 % and decreased relative MDH activity of 91.4 % compared to control (100 %). However, there are no studies reporting the activities of methanotrophic enzymes for methanol production through CO2  reduction pathway (in the absence of methane). Improved  methanol  production  from  CO2 have  been  suggested  to require higher activities of formate-, formaldehyde- and methanol dehydrogenase enzymes to accomplish the reduction of CO2 into methanol (Patel et al., 2016a; Xin et al. 2007). Authors have reported several approaches towards the enhancement of methanol production from greenhouse gases, such as, co-cultivation of methanotrophs, cell immobilization on various supports ( e.g. , polymers",
  "containing  magnetic  nanoparticles,  banana  leaves  and  coconut coir), and repeated-batch cultivation (Patel et al., 2022, 2021, 2020a). Moreover, authors have reported the use of biogas derived from dark fermentation  and  anaerobic  digestion  of  bio-wastes,  such  as,  potato peels and wheat straw, to reduce the cost associated with the utilization of pure gases as methanotrophic feed (Patel et al., 2023, 2022, 2021). However, to the best knowledge of the authors, this is the first study demonstrating the effect of elevated pressure on methanol production using methanotrophic bacteria as biocatalyst. Researchers have been working on different aspects of bioprocess to improve its economic feasibility at pilot scale. For instance, authors have reported the use of cheaper supports for cell immobilization, such as, banana leaves and coconut coir (Patel et al., 2021; 2020a). Similarly, biogas derived from anaerobic digestion of bio-wastes has been reported as an alternative feed to",
  "expensive pure gases (Patel et al. 2023). In the present study, an airlift reactor and a high-pressure stirred tank reactor have  been  designed.  These  could  further  be  scaled-up  for  pilot-scale studies in potential industries such as oil -gas extraction, refineries, gas processing industries and chemical plants where large amounts of offgases  containing  methane  and  CO2  are  available.  The  present  study can offer a potential technology which can be an ideal solution to the industries, offering simultaneous sequestration of greenhouse gases and value-addition  through  methanol  production.  Moreover,  the  two  reactors are designed to operate at room temperature, thus cutting-down the cost associated with maintenance of temperature, without compromising in yield and productivity. Economic feasibility can further be enhanced at pilot-scale through recycling of un-utilized methane and biomass in the first and second stages, respectively, of the two-stage integrated",
  "bioprocess. 4. Conclusions A combinatorial process engineering strategy was employed to twostage  integrated  bioprocess  for  improved  methanol  production  using M. trichosporium .  Use of micro-sparger, engagement of draft tube and supplementation of mass transfer vector in airlift reactor addressed the key challenge of mass transfer and solubility limitations of methane in the first stage. Biomass titer, biomass productivity and methane fixation rate were improved by 126 %, 143 % and 148 %, respectively, compared with the two-stage process without process engineering strategy. In the second stage, elevation of headspace pressure in reactor increased CO2 solubility, leading to 235.6 % increment in methanol titer, relative to atmospheric pressure.
