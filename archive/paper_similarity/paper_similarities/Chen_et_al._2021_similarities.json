      "raw_response": "Based on the provided summaries, the similarity score between Paper A and Paper B is Low. The reason for this low similarity score is due to the following differences in objectives, methods, and claims:\n\n1. Objectives:\n   - Paper A: The objective is to investigate a specific topic, likely related to the fields of study of the authors. The exact nature of the research objective is not specified.\n   - Paper B: The objective is to develop and demonstrate a 3D printed sensor block for housing sensors in the RAMOS device.\n\n2. Methods:\n   - Paper A: The approach involves a collaborative effort among the researchers, with contributions from multiple institutions. The specific methodological details are not provided.\n   - Paper B: The approach involves utilizing 3D printing technology to create a custom sensor block that accommodates the necessary sensors for the RAMOS device.\n\n3. Claims:\n   - Paper A: The paper does not make any specific claims about the research findings or outcomes.\n   - Paper B: The paper claims to have developed and demonstrated a 3D printed sensor block for the RAMOS device.\n\nIn summary, the two papers have different research objectives, methods, and claims, making their similarity score low. Paper A focuses on a general topic investigation, while Paper B specifically addresses the development of a 3D printed sensor block for a particular device."
