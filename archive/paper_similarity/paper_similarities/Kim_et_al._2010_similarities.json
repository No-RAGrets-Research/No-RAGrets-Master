      "raw_response": "SIMILARITY_SCORE: Low\n\nREASONING: The two research papers, Kim et al. 2010 and Engel et al. 2024 Suppl, are quite different in terms of their objectives, methods, and claims. \n\nKim et al. 2010 focuses on studying Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, a methanotrophic bacterium, and its ability to convert methane to methanol and further to formaldehyde. The researchers developed a novel compulsory circulation diffusion system for cell cultivation and used a methane/air mixture in a nitrate mineral salt culture medium under specific conditions. This paper is primarily concerned with the biological process of methanotrophy and the development of a specific cultivation system for the bacterium.\n\nOn the other hand, Engel et al. 2024 Suppl aims to develop and demonstrate a 3D printed sensor block for housing sensors in the RAMOS device. The approach involves utilizing 3D printing technology to create a custom sensor block that accommodates the necessary sensors for the RAMOS device. This paper is focused on the development of a technological solution for housing sensors in a specific device.\n\nGiven these differences in objectives, methods, and claims, the similarity score between these two research papers is low."
