      "raw_response": "Based on the provided summaries, the similarity score between Paper A and Paper B is Low. The reason for this low similarity score is due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Different Research Objectives: Paper A focuses on the use of methanol as a sole carbon source and inducer for recombinant protein production in methylotrophic yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris. In contrast, Paper B does not explicitly state its research objective in the provided summary, making it difficult to compare the objectives directly.\n\n2. Different Research Subjects: Paper A deals with the use of methanol in recombinant protein production in yeast, while Paper B does not mention any specific research subject or focus area.\n\n3. Lack of Information: The summary of Paper B only provides information about the authors' affiliations, which does not contribute to understanding the research objective, methods, or claims. To accurately compare the two papers, further information from Paper B is required.\n\nIn conclusion, due to the differences in research objectives, subjects, and the lack of information about Paper B, the similarity score between Paper A and Paper B is considered Low."
