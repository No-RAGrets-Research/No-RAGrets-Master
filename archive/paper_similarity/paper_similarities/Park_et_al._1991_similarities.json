      "raw_response": "SIMILARITY_SCORE: Low\n\nREASONING: The two research papers, Park et al. 1991 and Engel et al. 2024 Suppl, are quite different in terms of their objectives, methods, and claims. \n\n1. Objectives: Park et al. 1991 focuses on the batch cultivation of Methylosinus trichosporiurn OB3b for the production of soluble methane monooxygenase, which is a specific enzyme. On the other hand, Engel et al. 2024 Suppl aims to develop and demonstrate a 3D printed sensor block for housing sensors in the RAMOS device, which is a different type of research objective.\n\n2. Methods: The method used in Park et al. 1991 involves studying the growth and enzyme production of the microorganism under specific conditions. This is a biological research method. In contrast, Engel et al. 2024 Suppl uses 3D printing technology to create a custom sensor block, which is a technological research method.\n\n3. Claims: The claim of Park et al. 1991 is the investigation of the batch cultivation of Methylosinus trichosporiurn OB3b for the production of soluble methane monooxygenase. The claim of Engel et al. 2024 Suppl is the development and demonstration of a 3D printed sensor block for housing sensors in the RAMOS device.\n\nGiven these differences in objectives, methods,"
