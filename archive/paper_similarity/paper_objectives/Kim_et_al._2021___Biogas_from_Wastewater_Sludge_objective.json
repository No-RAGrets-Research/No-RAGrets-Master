  "objective_summary": "The main research objective of Kim et al. (2021) is to propose an effective method for biological carbon fixation and nitrogen removal in wastewater treatment using biogas from a wastewater treatment plant and bacterial community. The approach involves utilizing methanotrophs and ammonia-oxidizing bacteria clusters to induce type X methanotrophs that can use CO2 as a carbon source, and continuously supply reducing equivalents required for efficient biological carbon fixation.",
