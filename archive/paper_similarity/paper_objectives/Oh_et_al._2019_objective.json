  "objective_summary": "The main objective of the research by Oh et al. (2019) is to investigate the biological production of ethanol from ethane using whole-cell methanotrophs with methane monooxygenase. The study optimizes several independent variables, such as ethane concentration and biocatalyst amounts, to enhance the efficiency of ethane-to-ethanol bioconversion. The results demonstrate the technical feasibility of this biological gas-to-liquid conversion process as a new application for ethane gas.",
