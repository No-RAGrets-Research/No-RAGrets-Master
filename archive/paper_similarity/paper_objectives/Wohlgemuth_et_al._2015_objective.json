  "objective_summary": "The main research objective of Wohlgemuth et al. (2015) is to explore the integration of miniaturized tubular reactors into organic synthesis, leading to the development of flow chemistry. This approach aims to bridge the gap between engineers and chemists in creating sustainable production technology. The research highlights the benefits of continuous processing and bioprocesses in reducing costs, equipment size, energy consumption, solvent utilization, and waste, while maintaining high product quality in automated production plants.",
