  "objective_summary": "The main research objective of Joseph et al. (2022) is to explore the use of methanol as a sole carbon source and inducer for recombinant protein production in methylotrophic yeasts, such as Pichia pastoris. The study emphasizes the importance of monitoring methanol levels in fermentation processes to ensure healthy cell growth and maximum protein production. The researchers discuss various techniques for monitoring methanol levels in these processes.",
