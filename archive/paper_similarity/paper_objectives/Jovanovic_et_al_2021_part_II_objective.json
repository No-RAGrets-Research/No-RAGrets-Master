  "objective_summary": "The main research objective of this paper is to analyze the characteristic times in microscale-based biochemical processes, specifically focusing on bioreactors with immobilized cells and process flowsheet analysis. The approach involves a time scale analysis to understand the dynamics of these processes and their implications on the overall efficiency and performance of the bioreactors.",
