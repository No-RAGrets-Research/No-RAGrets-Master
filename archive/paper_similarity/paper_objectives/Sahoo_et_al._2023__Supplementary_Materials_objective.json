  "objective_summary": "The main research objective of the study by Sahoo et al. (2023) is to develop a process engineering strategy for improved methanol production in Methylosinus trichosporium by enhancing mass transfer and solubility of methane and carbon dioxide. The approach involves optimizing the conditions and parameters to facilitate better interaction between these gases and the microorganism, ultimately leading to increased methanol yield.",
