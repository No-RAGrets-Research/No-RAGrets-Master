  "objective_summary": "The main objective of the study by Jiang et al. (2023) is to develop a high H2S-tolerant biological system for cell cultivation and conversion of methane (CH4) to methanol under high levels of H2S stress. The researchers enriched a methanotrophic consortium from anaerobic digester effluent under high H2S stress and studied the effects of various factors such as CH4/air ratio, pH, temperature, and H2S concentration on cell",
