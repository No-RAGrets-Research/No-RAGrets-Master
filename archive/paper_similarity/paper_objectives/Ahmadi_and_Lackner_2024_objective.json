  "objective_summary": "The main research objective of the paper by Ahmadi & Lackner 2024 is to explore the potential of facultative methanotrophs in methanol production, particularly focusing on their ability to utilize waste-derived electron donors like acetate. The research approach involves comparing the efficiency of using these methanotrophs to the conventional costly electron donor, formate, in the methanol production process.",
