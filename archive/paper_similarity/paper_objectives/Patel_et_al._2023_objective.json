  "objective_summary": "The main research objective of Patel et al. (2023) is to evaluate the influence of copper and iron-based nanoparticles on methanotroph growth and methanol production from simulated biogas. The study employs a polymeric-matrix-based encapsulation system using NP-derived inoculums to enhance methanol production. The results show significant improvements in methanol production for Methyloferula stellata and Methylocystis bryophila free-cells-based bioconversion.",
