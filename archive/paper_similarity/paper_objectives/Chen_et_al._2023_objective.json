  "objective_summary": "The main research objective of the paper by Chen et al. (2023) is to develop a novel inverse membrane bioreactor for efficient bioconversion of methane gas to liquid methanol using a microbial gas-phase reaction. The approach involves the design and optimization of a membrane bioreactor system that facilitates the microbial conversion process, aiming to improve the overall efficiency and yield of liquid methanol production.",
