  "objective_summary": "The main research objective of Bjorck et al. (2018) is to explore the potential of gas-to-liquid technologies in exploiting and monetizing non-traditional and unutilized methane sources. The study focuses on methanol as the most promising product due to its robust and commercially mature conversion process from methane and beneficial fuel characteristics. The research also highlights the contrast between the energy-intensive and costly commercial methane-to-methanol conversion process and the more efficient methane conversion performed by methanot",
