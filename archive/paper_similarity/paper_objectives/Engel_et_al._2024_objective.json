  "objective_summary": "The main objective of the research is to develop a setup that facilitates the study of methanotrophic organisms and the screening of various strains and experimental conditions. The approach involves replicating large-scale fermentation conditions with constant gas flow, which accelerates media and process optimization. Additionally, the device's online monitoring capabilities reduce manual labor, allowing for in-depth and precise analyses of multiple parallel cultivations.",
