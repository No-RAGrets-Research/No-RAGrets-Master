  "objective_summary": "The main objective of the research by Hou et al. (1984) is to investigate the ability of methanotrophic bacteria to oxidize gaseous alkenes, specifically propylene, to their corresponding epoxides using an NADH-dependent methane monooxygenase. The study employs a gas-solid bioreactor with a cell paste of methane-grown methylotrophs coated on porous glass beads to ensure continuous production and removal of product epoxide from the microenvironment of the",
