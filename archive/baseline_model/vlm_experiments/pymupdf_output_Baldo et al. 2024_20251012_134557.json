Montpellier, ENSCM, CNRS, Montpellier,\nFrance\nMethane (CH4) hydroxylation into methanol (MeOH) by methanotrophic bacteria\nis an attractive and sustainable approach to producing MeOH. The model strain\nMethylosinus trichosporium OB3b has been reported to be an efﬁcient\nhydroxylating biocatalyst. Previous works have shown that regardless of the\nbioreactor\ndesign\nor\noperation\nmode,\nMeOH\nconcentration\nreaches\na\nthreshold after a few hours, but there are no investigations into the reasons\nbehind this phenomenon. The present work entails monitoring both MeOH and\nformate concentrations during CH4 hydroxylation, where neither a gaseous\nsubstrate nor nutrient shortage was evidenced. Under the assayed reaction\nconditions, bacterial stress was shown to occur, but methanol was not\nresponsible\nfor\nthis.\nFormate\naddition\nwas\nnecessary\nto\nstart\nMeOH\nproduction. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses with\n13C-formate proved\nthat the formate was instrumental in regenerating NADH; formate was\nexhausted during the reaction, but increased quantities of formate were\nunable to prevent MeOH production stop. The formate mass balance showed\nthat the formate-to-methanol yield was around 50%, suggesting a cell regulation\nphenomenon. Hence, this study presents the possible physiological causes that\nneed to be investigated further. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this study\nshows that the reaction can be achieved in the native bacterial culture (i.e., culture\nmedium containing added methanol dehydrogenase inhibitors) by avoiding the\ncentrifugation steps while limiting the hands-on time and water consumption.\nKEYWORDS\nbiohydroxylation, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, methanol production, formate,\nlimitations\n1 Introduction\nAtmospheric methane (CH4) is the second largest contributor to the greenhouse effect\nafter carbon dioxide (CO2); its global warming potential is known to be 84-fold higher than\nthat of CO2 over 20 years and 28-fold over a century (Pachauri et al., 2015).

This latter molecule has garnered growing\ninterest as MeOH can be used as a precursor for plastic and fuel\nproduction. Since methanol is liquid at room temperature, it is safer\nand more convenient to store and transport than pressured gas.\nIndustrial processes that convert CH4 to MeOH currently involve\nnatural gas steam reforming followed by Fisher–Tropsch synthesis\non the generated syngas. Several conversion processes exist, but\nthese generally require pressures of around 30 bar and temperatures\nup to 1,000°C (Aasberg-Petersen et al., 2011; Soussan et al., 2016;\nLee, 2019), which make them energy intensive. Moreover, these\nmethods only allow partial selectivity and result in signiﬁcant CO2\nemissions (Soussan et al., 2016; Bjorck et al., 2018).\nBiological\nconversion\nof\nCH4\ninto\nMeOH\n(i.e.,\nbiohydroxylation) by methanotrophic bacteria appears to be a\npromising approach for more sustainable CH4 valorization.\nBiohydroxylation is a highly selective one-pot reaction carried\nout under physiological conditions; it exhibits favorable carbon\nbalance and generates water as the only byproduct. Methylosinus\ntrichosporium OB3b is a model mesophilic non-pathogenic strain\nthat grows at around 30°C under atmospheric pressure, whose\nhydroxylating abilities are well-known (Whittenbury et al., 1970).\nMethanotrophic central carbon metabolism utilizes CH4 as the\nsole energy and carbon source, where CH4 is fully oxidized to\nCO2 through sequential enzymatic oxidations. As shown in\nFigure 1, the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO) is\nresponsible for CH4 uptake and oxidation into MeOH as per\nEquation 1:\nCH4 + O2 + NADH + H+ →CH3OH + NAD+ + H2O\n(1)\nMethanol dehydrogenase (MDH) then oxidizes MeOH into\nformaldehyde,\nwhich\nis\nlater\nconverted\ninto\nformate\nby\nformaldehyde dehydrogenase (FADH). Formate dehydrogenase\n(FDH) then catalyzes the ﬁnal oxidation of formate into CO2,\nwith concomitant NAD+ regeneration into NADH. Thereafter,\nmore than 60% of the CO2 produced is assimilated into the\nbacterial\nbiomass\n(Yang\net\nal.,\n2013).\nThus,\nFDH\nallows\nregeneration of the reducing equivalents required for the catalytic\nactivity of MMO (Figure 1).\nM. trichosporium OB3b synthesizes two MMO forms, namely\nsoluble MMO (sMMO) and particulate MMO (pMMO), depending\non the Cu2+ concentration (Sirajuddin and Rosenzweig, 2015). Both\nenzymes catalyze the same oxidation reaction, but pMMO is\nreported to have greater afﬁnity toward CH4 (Sirajuddin and\nRosenzweig, 2015; Bjorck et al., 2018). pMMO is not stable\noutside the cell membrane, which explains why whole-cell\nbacteria are still preferred over the isolated enzyme to catalyze\nCH4 oxidation into MeOH (Sirajuddin and Rosenzweig, 2015;\nSoussan et al., 2016). MeOH production has been shown to be\nexogenous, i.e., MeOH is accumulated in the external medium (Pen\net\nal.,\n2014).\nThus,\nMeOH\naccumulation\nin\nwhole-cell\nmethanotrophs relies on inhibiting MDH (Figure 1). Several\nMDH inhibitors have been reported to date, such as high\nphosphate concentrations, NaCl, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\n(EDTA),\nMgCl2,\nand\ncyclopropanol.\nPrevious\nstudies\nhave\nevidenced the synergistic effects of NaCl and EDTA (Pen et al.,\n2014) in ensuring efﬁcient MeOH production.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, MDH inhibition interrupts the\nsuccessive oxidations of MeOH, thus causing collateral damage to\nthe downstream FDH enzyme. This deprives FDH of its substrate,\nstopping both formate oxidation and NAD+ reduction. The addition\nof sodium formate (NaCOOH) as an external electron donor is\ntherefore necessary to ensure NADH regeneration by FDH, as\nexpressed by Equation 2.\nNAD+ + HCOO−→NADH + CO2\n(2)\nFormate also plays a key role in the metabolism of M.\ntrichosporium OB3b (Figure 1); for example, it enters the\nFIGURE 1\nGeneral metabolic pathway for CH4 assimilation in methanotrophic bacteria.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 3\n\ntetrahydrofolate pathway to feed the downstream serine cycle\n(Matsen\net\nal.,\n2013)\nand\ncontributes\nto\ngeneral\nbacterial\nmetabolism. Previous studies have shown that an initial sodium\nformate concentration of 20 mmol/L enhances MeOH production\n(Lee et al., 2004; Duan et al., 2011). MeOH production balance is\nthus given by Equation 3:\nCH4 + O2 + HCOO−+ H+ →CH3OH + CO2 + H2O\n(3)\nTo the best of our knowledge, the highest reported methanol\nproductivity by M. trichosporium OB3b was 270 mg MeOH/gdry cell/h\nunder batch conditions (Pen et al., 2014). The production kinetics of\nMeOH are usually divided into three phases, where MeOH ﬁrst\nincreases linearly, then slows down, and ﬁnally stabilizes around a\nmaximum value corresponding to a concentration plateau. This\nMeOH production plateau is reported to occur at around 10 h for\nall methanotrophic strains, bioreactor designs, and operation modes\ntested (Mehta et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2010; Duan et al.,\n2011; Pen et al., 2014; Farhan Ul Haque et al., 2016; Mardina et al.,\n2016; Taylor et al., 2018; Ito et al., 2021; Kulkarni et al., 2021; Bo\net al., 2023).\nThe present work seeks to understand the reasons behind the stop\nof MeOH accumulation so as to extend the MeOH production time.\nThe potential limitations that could cause MeOH production stop\nwere consequently studied herein. First, the MeOH generation\npathway was evaluated through\n13C-labeled assays. Then, the\ngaseous substrates, nutrients, or external electron donor limitations\nwere considered. Methanol toxicity on the bacteria was also assessed.\nFinally, formate use was further elucidated by investigating the\nrelationships between the formate and MeOH concentrations.\n2 Material and methods\nUnless noted otherwise, all chemicals listed hereafter were\nsupplied by Sigma-Aldrich, France. Their purity grade was at\nleast that speciﬁed by the American Chemical Society. Ultrapure\nwater was produced with a Milli-Q system (Millipore), and ambient\nair was used wherever required. CH4 (purity: 99.5%) was provided\nby Linde, France.\n2.1 Bacterial strain and cultivation conditions\nM. trichosporium OB3b (NCIMB 11131) was rehydrated and\ncultured in a modiﬁed medium containing nitrate mineral salts\n(NMS), as described by Pen et al. (2014). The NMS base medium\ncontained 1.06 g/L of KH2PO4, 4.34 g/L of Na2HPO4•12H2O, 1.70 g/L of\nNaNO3, 0.34 g/L of K2SO4, and 0.074 g/L of MgSO4•7H2O, which was\nthen steam-sterilized; the pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.1 with 0.1 M HCl or\nNaOH. In parallel, solutions of 1000× copper (0.798 g/L of CuSO4), iron\n(11.2 g/L of FeSO4•7H2O), and trace elements (7.0 g/L of CaCl2•2H2O,\n0.57 g/L of ZnSO4•7H2O, 0.445 g/L of MnSO4•H2O, 0.124 g/L of H3BO3,\n0.096 g/L of Na2MoO4•2H2O, 0.096 g/L of CoCl2•6H2O, and 0.166 g/L\nof KI) were prepared separately and sterilized using 0.22 µm\npolyethersulfone (PES) sterile syringe ﬁlters (Branchia). Each solution\nwas then supplied at 1 mL/L to the base NMS medium.\nThe strain was cultured in sealed glass vials under a CH4/air\natmosphere (1:4 v/v) and incubated at 30°C under rotation at\n160 rpm (Unimax 1010, Heidolph). Before each liquid subculture\nand methanol production assay, the bacterial suspensions were\nplated on agar plates prepared with 25 g/L of Miller’s lysogeny\nbroth (LB) and 15 g/L of microbiological agar before being incubated\nat 30°C to check for the absence of heterotrophic contamination. The\nbacterial cultures were maintained on the NMS agar plates grown\nunder the CH4/air (1:4 v/v) atmosphere at 30°C. The plates were\nsubcultured once a month.\n2.2 Methanol production assays in\nbatch mode\nThe methanol production assays were carried out in either the\nreference or modiﬁed reaction medium (RM). The reference RM\nwas composed of 1.07 g/L of KH2PO4, 1.80 g/L of Na2HPO4•12 H2O,\n5.844 g/L of NaCl, 1.36 g/L of CHNaO2, and 0.292 g/L of EDTA,\nwhose pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.1 with 0.1 M HCl or NaOH (Kim\net al., 2010; Pen et al., 2014). In some cases, the formate\nconcentration was changed upon comparison with the reference\nRM. Some experiments were also carried out in the RM by replacing\n12C-formate\nwith\n13C-formate\nand\nin\nthe\nNMS\nmedium\nsupplemented\nwith\nthe\nsame\nNaCl,\nCHNaO2,\nand\nEDTA\nconcentrations as in the reference RM. The NMS medium could\nbe either freshly prepared or native, i.e., a culture medium in which\nthe bacterial cells had grown and already exhausted a portion of the\nsupplied nutrients.\nBacterial cells cultured in the NMS medium were collected\nduring exponential growth and centrifuged at 4°C and 3,893g for\n20 min. The NMS medium was then discarded and cell pellets were\nresuspended in an equivalent volume of fresh reference or test RM.\nIn all assays, the dry cell concentration of the resting cell suspension\nreached 0.25 ± 0.1 gdry cell/L (Section 2.3), 6 mL of the resting cell\nsuspension were then transferred in 60 mL gas-tight sealed vials. For\neach experiment, a set of identical vials was ﬁlled with the same\nbacterial suspension and incubated. MeOH accumulation was then\ninduced by ﬁlling the headspace with a mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v)\nthat\nwas\npreviously\nﬁltered\nusing\nautoclaved\n0.20\nµm\npolytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) ﬁlters (Sartorius). The reactors\nwere incubated at 30°C under 160 rpm rotation (Unimax 1010,\nHeidolph),\nand\nthe\nreactors\nwere\nsampled\nafter\ndifferent\nreaction times.\nThe gaseous substrate limitations were investigated in some of the\nexperiments. Here, MeOH production was carried out in the reference\nRM, and the gaseous headspace was renewed twice during the reaction\nby pumping it out and reﬁlling with a mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v) at\nt = 6 h and t = 24 h. For each MeOH production experiment, two\nindependent controls (i.e., operated under the reference conditions)\nwere implemented against two independent test reactors. MeOH was\nalso supplied to the RM initially to assess methanol toxicity in\none assay.\n2.3 Analyses\nSamples containing 2 mL of each bacterial suspension were used\nfor direct pH and optical density (OD) measurements (Section\n2.3.1). The remaining suspension volumes were immediately\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n03\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 4\n\ntransferred to 2 mL safe-lock Eppendorf tubes. Samples dedicated to\nfurther formate analyses (Section 2.3.2) were stored as pelleted\nsuspensions, while those used for ulterior MeOH quantiﬁcations\nwere centrifuged at 4°C and 3,893g for 4 min to eliminate the cell\npellets\nbefore\nstorage.\nAll\nsamples\nwere\nstored\nat\n−20°C\nuntil analyses.\n2.3.1 pH and OD monitoring\nThe biomass concentrations were estimated through OD\nmeasurements at 600 nm (OD600nm) with a UV-VIS 2401PC\nspectrophotometer (Shimadzu) using the following correlation\n(Equation 4) (Pen et al., 2014):\ndry biomass\n\u0001\n\u0003 gdry cell\u0004L\n\u0005\n\u0006 \u0002 0.322* OD600nm\n(4)\nThe\npH\nwas\nmonitored\nduring\nthe\nreaction\nwith\na\nC831 pH meter (Consort).\n2.3.2 Methanol and formate quantiﬁcations by gas\nchromatography mass spectrometry (GC-MS)\nMethanol\nand\nformate\nwere\nquantiﬁed\nusing\na\ngas\nchromatography\n(Trace\n1300,\nThermo\nScientiﬁc)\nmass\nspectrometry (ISQ 7000, Thermo Scientiﬁc) system. The electronic\nimpact source was operated at 70 eV, and both analyses required a RtQ-Bond Plot capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, Restek) and\nhelium at 1.2 mL/min as the carrier gas. 0.5 µL of the sample volume\nwas introduced into the injector at 250°C, and a split ratio of 100 was\napplied to quantify formate and methanol.\nMethanol accumulation kinetics was monitored in the reaction\nsupernatants. High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-\ngrade pure ethanol (Carlo Erba) was added to the thawed reaction\nsupernatant as the internal standard at a ﬁnal concentration of\n29.6 mg/L. This method involved prior heating at 90°C, followed\nby two successive temperature gradients of 10°C/min up to 150°C\n(hold time of 3 min) and 20°C/min up to 200°C (hold time of 10 min).\nThe formate consumption kinetics was monitored in the whole\nbacterial suspensions using a previously described method (RuizValencia et al., 2020), where the samples underwent a derivatization\ntreatment after thawing. Methanol esteriﬁcation on the formate was\ncarried out with the addition of pure MeOH and H2SO4\n(Equation 5), and the methyl formate produced was quantiﬁed\nby GC-MS. HPLC-grade pure acetonitrile was added as the\ninternal standard at a ﬁnal concentration of 17.47 mg/L. This\nmethod\ninvolved\nprior\nheating\nat\n40°C,\nfollowed\nby\ntwo\nsuccessive temperature gradients of 10°C/min up to 150°C (hold\ntime of 3 min) and 20°C/min up to 200°C (hold time of 10 min).\nCH3OH + HCOO−+ H+ →HCOOCH3 + H2O\n(5)\nThe 12C and 13C-labeled MeOH and formate were discriminated\naccording to the following mass-to-charge ratios (m/z): 31 for\n12C-MeOH, 33 for\n13C-MeOH, 60 for\n12C-methyl formate, and\n61 for 13C-methyl formate.\n2.3.3 13C-labeled formate monitoring with nuclear\nmagnetic resonance (NMR)\n13C spectra were recorded at 298 K on a Bruker Avance III\n500 NMR spectrometer equipped with a 5 mm 1H/X BBO Helium\ncryoprobe. All data were processed with the Bruker Topspin\n3.6.2 software. The\n13C UDEFT sequence was used (NS =\n1024 scans), and all NMR analyses were conducted in duplicate\nin 5-mm-diameter tubes. A control was also implemented with a\nnon-inoculated reaction medium to determine the chemical shift of\n13C-labeled sodium formate (δ = 171.02 ppm). 900 µL of each resting\ncell suspension was sampled at t = 0 h as the control, followed by\nsampling at t = 4 h, t = 20 h, and t = 48 h. 100 μL of D2O was added to\neach NMR tube before analysis. The concentrations of 12C-MeOH\nand formate must reach at least 500 mg/L to be detected by 13C\nNMR. By enriching the compounds with 13C (instead of 12C), the\nNMR carbon acquisition sensitivity can be increased to more than\n90-fold (Ruiz-Valencia et al., 2020, 2024). The lower detection limit\nof NMR for 13C-MeOH and 13C-formate was indeed about 6 mg/L,\nas shown in previous studies (Ruiz-Valencia et al., 2020, 2024).\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 MeOH production and reproducibility\nThe ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to oxidize CH4\ninto MeOH was assessed under the reference conditions (see\nSection 2.2), which were chosen according to a previous study\n(Pen et al., 2014) that showed that this RM composition\nproduced the best MeOH hydroxylation performances over those\nrelying on high phosphate concentrations for MDH inhibition\n(Mehta et al., 1991; Duan et al., 2011). The MeOH concentration\n([MeOH], mg/L) was monitored using four independent assays\n(Figure 2). Each independent assay was conducted with a\ndifferent\nsubculture\n(one\nmonth\nmaximum\nbetween\ntwo\nconsecutive subcultures) and was duplicated with the same\nbacterial suspension. The pH and dry biomass concentration\n([dry biomass], gdry cell/L) were measured at the beginning and\nend of the experiment.\nThe MeOH production kinetics were almost identical in all\ncases, where MeOH was produced quasilinearly during the ﬁrst 6 h\nFIGURE 2\nMeOH production kinetics by M. trichosporium OB3b in the\nbatch mode under the reference conditions (results of four\nindependent assays).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n04\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 5\n\nuntil reaching a concentration of 190 ± 10 mg/L (Figure 2). MeOH\naccumulation continued thereafter but slowed signiﬁcantly until\n20 h, at which point the concentration was 292 ± 14 mg/L; thereafter,\nthe production evolved by very little up to 48 h (Figure 2), with the\nMeOH concentration either stabilizing (hence achieving a plateau\naround 303 ± 10 mg/L) or accumulating very slightly (reaching a\nmaximum of 355 ± 19 mg/L). Nevertheless, the ﬁnal MeOH\nconcentration had the same order of magnitude for all four\nexperiments. These results are in accordance with previous\nstudies (Pen et al., 2014; Pen et al., 2016) carried out under\nsimilar conditions.\nThe differences observed in the ﬁnal concentrations of MeOH\nmay be attributed to various factors, mostly biological variability\nand evolution of the speciﬁc activity of M. trichosporium OB3b\nalong the subcultures. Consequently, the control kinetics under\nthe reference conditions were always implemented against the\ntest conditions in the remaining studies. The pH increased from\n6.98 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.74 ± 0.04 at t = 48 h; this moderate-tomedium alkalinization is consistent with Equation 1 since MeOH\nproduction requires consuming the molar equivalent of protons\nto oxidize CH4 (1:1 stoichiometry, Equation 3). Whittenbury\net al. (1970) noted that all of their isolated methanotrophic\nstrains, including M. trichosporium OB3b, grew well on a\nbroad pH range of 5.8–7.4. The pMMO extraction protocols\noften involve buffers with pH of around 7.5 (Lieberman et al.,\n2003). The maximum pH value of 7.75 ± 0.01 obtained herein was\nthus not considered to be harmful to the bacterial physiology. To\nevaluate this assumption, M. trichosporium OB3b growth tests\nwere conducted at pH = 7.0 and pH = 7.85; no signiﬁcant\ndifferences\nwere\nobserved\n(Supplementary\nmaterials),\nconﬁrming that such moderate-to-medium alkalinization had\nno deleterious effects.\nThe OD600nm was monitored at the same reaction time at which\nthe\nMeOH\nconcentration\nwas\nquantiﬁed.\nThe\nOD600nm\nmeasurement is known to be mainly sensitive to whole cells, i.e.,\ndelimited by biological membranes (Beal et al., 2020). Thus, a\nsigniﬁcant decrease in the OD600nm value means that cell lysis\n(and death) occurred. On the contrary, increasing values of\nOD600nm evidence cell proliferation, whereas constant OD600nm\nvalues imply constant cell concentrations. The relevance of using\nOD600nm to monitor the M. trichosporium OB3b cell concentration\nwas thus assessed. A correlation between the OD600nm value and dry\ncell concentration was established previously (Equation 4; Section\n2.3.1); an additional correlation between the OD600nm values and\nconcentrations of fresh cultivable cells ([cultivable cells], CFU/mL)\nwas\nobtained\nfor\nM.\ntrichosporium\nOB3b\nbased\non\nfour\nobservations, with a linear determination coefﬁcient (R2) of 0.9506.\ncultivable cells\n[\n] CFU\u0007mL\n\b\n \u0002 1.21 106* OD600 nm\n(6)\nThe OD600nm value is thus an appropriate tool for monitoring\nM. trichosporium OB3b cell concentration. Nevertheless, the cell\nviability and cultivability are likely to evolve over time, which\nrenders the correlation between OD600nm and dry biomass\nconcentration more reliable. In this study, OD600nm was\nconverted into the dry biomass concentration in accordance\nwith Equation 4. The dry biomass within the reactor generally\nremained constant, beginning at 0.331 ± 0.004 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h\nimmediately after cell pellet resuspension in the RM and ending\nat 0.318 ± 0.003 gdry cell/L at t = 48 h (which is less than 5%\nvariation from the initial dry biomass concentration). Two\nhypotheses may be used to explain such results: bacterial\ndeath and proliferation occurred simultaneously with identical\nrates or the dry cell concentration remained steady. Knowing that\nthe bacteria could be grown in the reaction medium devoid of\nMDH inhibitors in the same way as that in the NMS culture\nmedium (reaching similar OD600nm values of around 0.292 ±\n0.002 gdry cell/L within 22 h under both conditions), this means\nthat the presence of MDH inhibitors was efﬁcient enough to\nprevent methane uptake and the subsequent biomass synthesis\npathway. Therefore, the dry biomass was constant under the\nreaction conditions tested, and the equilibrium between bacterial\ngrowth and death was ruled out. It is worth noting that very little\nbacterial\nlysis\noccurred\ndespite\nthe\nstressful\nconditions\nexperienced by the bacterial cells (i.e., disruption of CH4\nassimilation pathway, Figure 1).\n3.2 Elucidating the MeOH\nproduction pathway\nAccording to Figure 1, MeOH is an intermediate metabolite in\nthe methanotrophic core carbon metabolism. FDH, FADH, and\nMDH enzymes are known to be reversible, i.e., they can either\noxidize the CH4-deriving molecules or reduce the CO2-deriving\nmolecules (Xin et al., 2007; Sahoo et al., 2022; Sahoo et al., 2023),\nwhereas MMO is an irreversible enzyme that is only able to oxidize\nCH4 into MeOH (Pen et al., 2016). MeOH could therefore result\nfrom CH4 oxidation catalyzed by MMO or from CO2/formate/\nformaldehyde serial reductions by FDH, FADH, and MDH,\nrespectively. Therefore, the initial addition of sodium formate as\nan external electron donor could also be a carbon source for MeOH\nproduction.\nTo discriminate between both of the possible MeOH origins,\nan experiment was carried out under the reference conditions\nwith 13C-labeled formate. Whole-cell bacterial suspensions were\nsampled and analyzed at t = 4 h (during linear MeOH\nproduction),\nt =\n20 h (beginning of MeOH production\nslowdown), and t = 48 h (MeOH accumulation stop). The\n13C-NMR analyses were complemented by quantiﬁcations of\nthe 12C- and 13C-labeled MeOH and formate through GC-MS.\nThe corresponding 13C-NMR spectra are presented in Figure 3\nalong with the GC-MS results. The sample spectra exhibit two\nsigniﬁcant peak variations over t = 0 h to t = 48 h, whose\ncorresponding chemical shifts (δ) were detected as 171.02 and\n160.2 ppm. An additional signal with a chemical shift of\n124.6 ppm was visible at t = 4 h, which remained at a low\nintensity thereafter.\nA control tube containing the non-inoculated 13C-formate RM\nwas analyzed previously. Its NMR spectrum showed a single peak\nwith a chemical shift of 171.02 ppm without any background noise\n(data not shown). This 171.02 ppm signal was attributed to\n13C-formate,\nand\nthe\nintensity\ncorresponding\nto\nthis\npeak\ndecreased from t = 0 h to t = 48 h (Figures 3A–D), suggesting\n13C-formate uptake. This consumption was conﬁrmed by GC-MS.\nThe\n13C-formate concentration indeed diminished from 0.79 ±\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n05\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 6\n\n0.06 g/L at t = 0 h to 0.15 ± 0.04 g/L at t = 48 h (Figure 3E). The\n12C-formate concentration generally remained constant at a low\nvalue (around 0.08 g/L, Figure 3E), meaning that there was no\n12C-formate production. Therefore, 12C-formate was initially present\nin the reaction mixture, and the mean 12C-formate concentration\nrepresented\nno\nmore\nthan\n10%\nof\nthe\ninitial\n13C-formate\nconcentration.\nMeanwhile, a peak with a chemical shift of 160.2 ppm was\nobserved at 4 h (Figure 3B), whose signal intensity increased up to\n48 h (Figures 3B–D). Previous studies have already identiﬁed the\ncorresponding molecule as the 13C-labeled hydrogenocarbonate ion\n(H13CO3\n−) (Ruiz-Valencia et al., 2020, 2024). According to the pKa\nvalue of H2O,CO2/HCO3\n−, H13CO3\n−is the main solubilized form of\ncarbon dioxide in the pH range of 7–8 (i.e., pH variations observed\nduring reaction under the reference condition). Furthermore, a peak\ncorresponding to a chemical shift of 124.6 ppm was signiﬁcantly\nobserved at t = 4 h (Figure 3B). Previous studies have already\nattributed this peak to 13C-labeled CO2. Its intensity was inferior to\nthe peak attributed to H13CO3\n−and generally remained constant up\nto t = 48 h (Figures 3B–D), conﬁrming that H13CO3\n−was the\nprevalent form of 13C-labeled CO2 under these operating conditions.\nThe NMR spectra (Figures 3A–D) did not exhibit any peaks at\n50.1 or 50.2 ppm, which are the corresponding chemical shifts of\n13C-MeOH (Cornish et al., 1984; Mason et al., 1987). However, the\nGC-MS results show that 12C-MeOH was produced at a maximum\nconcentration of 277 ± 30 mg/L at 48 h (Figure 3E), as is usually\nFIGURE 3\nCH4 hydroxylation by M. trichosporium OB3b in the batch mode under the reference conditions with 13C-formate: nuclear magnetic resonance\nspectra at (A) t = 0 h, (B) 4 h, (C) 20 h, and (D) 48 h; (E) gas chromatography mass spectrometry quantiﬁcations of 12C-MeOH, 13C-labeled MeOH,\n12C-formate, and 13C-labeled formate.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n06\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 7\n\nobtained under the reference reaction conditions. In addition, the\n13C-MeOH concentration remained negligible and never exceeded\n1.5 ± 0.2 mg/L, accounting for 0.5% of the 12C-MeOH at t = 48 h\n(Figure 3E). 13C-MeOH did not exceed its natural occurrence and\ncould therefore not be observed in the NMR spectra as well as\nunlabeled MeOH produced, whose concentration was below\n500 mg/L (see Section 2.3.3).\nThe absence of the\n13C-associated peak apart from those\nassociated with 13C-formate consumption and 13CO2 production\n(mainly under its basic form H13CO3\n−) conﬁrms that the cells likely\nused\n13C-formate as the external electron donor for NADH\nregeneration by FDH, according to Equation 2 and Figure 1.\nDespite some studies reporting that M. trichosporium strains\n(including OB3b) were able to produce MeOH by reversing their\nCH4 oxidation pathways (Xin et al., 2007; Sahoo et al., 2022; Sahoo\net al., 2023), formate was not reduced to 13C-MeOH under our\noperating conditions. The MeOH produced was solely a result of\nCH4 oxidation by MMO. Moreover, these data conﬁrm that MMO is\nan\nirreversible\nenzyme\nas\n13CH4\nwould\nhave\nbeen\ngenerated otherwise.\nNevertheless, as observed in Figure 2, MeOH production\ndecreased\nwith\ntime\nand\ntended\nto\nlevel\noff\nat\na\nﬁnal\nconcentration of around 300 mg/L. A previous study carried out\nat our laboratory excluded MeOH inhibition on the MMO enzyme\n(Pen et al., 2016). Indeed, fresh RM renewals during the reaction at\n4.5 h and 22 h led to a ﬁnal MeOH quantity that was not signiﬁcantly\ndifferent from that obtained under the reference conditions, i.e.,\nwithout RM renewal (Pen et al., 2016). Thus, MeOH production\nstop could be a result of gaseous substrates and/or nutrient\nlimitations as well as electron donor shortage preventing NADH\nregeneration. These hypotheses were also investigated in this study,\nas detailed below.\n3.3 Gaseous substrate limitations\nMethane oxidation into MeOH requires CH4 and O2 as\nsubstrates at molar equivalents (1:1 stoichiometry, Equation 1).\nThe reactors were ﬁlled with a mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v) at\nt = 0 h. Since the ambient atmosphere contains around 80% N2 and\n20% O2, the injected gas mixture allowed an approximately\nequimolar initial CH4/O2 ratio in the vials. The theoretical\ncalculations based on the ideal gas law show that the initial gas\nquantities in the vials could result in almost 6-fold superior MeOH\nconcentrations (1.86 g/L of MeOH) compared to the obtained\nresults (i.e., MeOH plateau around 300 mg/L, Figure 2). Pen\net al. (2014) previously detailed similar calculations in their\nstudy. Thus, CH4 and O2 are not assumed to be limiting.\nM. trichosporium OB3b is an obligate aerobic methanotroph,\nand its metabolism may use O2 in competing metabolic pathways,\nsuch as the electron transport chain, to generate energy during\nrespiration. Moreover, O2 solubility in aqueous media at 30°C is\nabout 10-fold lower than that of CH4, making it the most suitable\ncandidate for substrate limitation under batch conditions (Perry and\nGreen, 1998; Pen et al., 2014). A practical assay was thus conducted\nto check the absence of gaseous substrate limitations. In this test, the\nheadspace gases in the vials were pumped out and replaced with a\nfresh mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v) at 6 h (end of the linear MeOH\nproduction phase, Figure 2) and 24 h (near the end of MeOH\nproduction, Figure 2). An assay was also conducted under the\nreference\nconditions\n(i.e.,\nwithout\nany\ngas\nrenewal)\nsimultaneously; these results are given in Figure 4. They show\nthat headspace renewal during the reaction had no effect on the\nquantity of MeOH produced or on the production kinetics,\nhighlighting that the MeOH production plateau is not due to any\ngaseous substrate limitation during the reaction.\n3.4 Nutrient limitations\nThe\nNMS\nculture\nmedium\nis\nformulated\nto\nsupport\nmethanotroph\nproliferation,\nwhich\nimplies\nnormal\ncarbon\nmetabolism and optimal MMO catalytic activity. In particular, it\ncontains nitrates (NO3\n−) that act as nitrogen sources and diverse\nmicronutrients. On the contrary, the RM composition is limited to\nphosphates as the buffering agents, NaCl and EDTA as the MDH\ninhibitors, and sodium formate as an external electron donor for\nNADH regeneration (Section 2.2). A potential nutrient shortage\ncould be detrimental to bacterial physiology and/or affect their\nability to maintain sufﬁcient and functional MMO stock during\nreaction. Therefore, MeOH production in the richest medium\nsuitable for methanotroph metabolism was assayed by adding the\nreference NaCl, EDTA, and formate quantities to fresh NMS\nmedium (Figure 5A). In this case, the fresh RM and amended\nfresh NMS ionic strengths had the same orders of magnitude\n(around 0.1–0.2 mol/L). Another assay was conducted with the\nnative NMS directly, i.e., the culture medium in which the bacterial\ncells had grown and already exhausted a portion of the nutrients\n(Figure 5B). This spent culture medium containing bacterial cells\n(i.e., bacterial suspension in exponential growth) was supplied with a\nsmall volume of a solution containing concentrated formate and\nMDH inhibitors to achieve the same concentration as in the\nreference RM without inducing signiﬁcant dilution (Section 2.2).\nThe trials under the reference conditions described in Section 2.2\nwere always implemented in parallel (Figures 5A, B).\nFigure 5A shows no improvement in MeOH production with the\nfresh NMS supplemented with formate and MDH inhibitors\ncompared to the reference RM. Thus, M. trichosporium OB3b does\nFIGURE 4\nMeOH production by M. trichosporium OB3b in the batch mode\nunder the reference conditions (ﬁlled circles) and with headspace\nrenewals at 6 and 24 h (empty circles).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n07\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 8\n\nnot appear to experience any nutrient shortage during reaction. The\nreference conditions showed very little dry biomass evolution from\n0.233 ± 0.001 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h to 0.243 ± 0.006 gdry cell/L at t = 48 h.\nThe dry biomass evolved similarly to that in NMS supplemented with\nformate and MDH inhibitors (i.e., from 0.229 ± 0.001 gdry cell/L at t =\n0 h to 0.265 ± 0.002 gdry cell/L at t = 48 h), indicating no bacterial\ngrowth during the reaction and appropriate MDH inhibition.\nNo signiﬁcant difference in MeOH production was evidenced\nbetween the reference and native NMS conditions (Figure 5B).\nAlthough this procedure does not extend the MeOH production\ntime, it has several practical advantages. The culture phase\nsuspensions no longer require centrifugation to discard the spent\nNMS or resuspension of the bacterial pellet in fresh RM. Therefore,\nit is more convenient, has lower contamination risk, reduces the\nhands-on working time, and limits water consumption due to the\npreparation of large RM volumes. After verifying the absence of\nsubstrate and nutrient limitations, this study focused on the\npotential toxicity of methanol against the bacteria.\n3.5 Methanol toxicity\nThere are extensive investigations in literature regarding MeOH\ntoxicity on M. trichosporium OB3b growth under culture conditions.\nThe reported toxicity threshold concentrations for M. trichosporium\nOB3b vary strongly depending on the source (Whittenbury et al.,\n1970; Best and Higgins, 1981; Adegbola, 2008). Some studies have\nreported severe toxicity with concentrations as low as 0.01% (w/v)\nequivalent to 0.1 g/L (Whittenbury et al., 1970), while others have\nevidenced possible growth up to 4% (v/v) (equivalent to 31.6 g/L)\nafter adaptation to MeOH (Best and Higgins, 1981). Other\nresearchers have shown growth rate decreases for MeOH ranging\nfrom 0.3 g/L to 0.6 g/L, with complete inhibition of growth above\n40 g/L (Adegbola, 2008). Conversely, few studies have reported\nMeOH toxicity affecting the ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to\noxidize CH4 under reaction conditions. Kim et al. (2010) reported a\ndecrease in MeOH production and reduction of nearly 30% in\npMMO activity with an initial 5 mM concentration (equivalent\nto 160 mg/L). On the contrary, another work mentioned that\n400 mg/L of MeOH did not affect the enzymatic activity of\nMMO measured by propylene epoxidation (Hwang et al., 2015).\nMeOH toxicity on the ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to\noxidize CH4 and produce MeOH thus needed to be clariﬁed further.\nM. trichosporium OB3b was freshly recovered from the culture, as\ndescribed in Section 2.2, and thus assumed to be in a good\nphysiological state. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in a\nRM initially supplemented with the maximal concentration of\nMeOH reached in the previous assays (i.e., 300 mg/L) to test\ntheir hydroxylating activity. A test was also conducted with the\nsame bacterial suspension under reference conditions, i.e., without\nany MeOH addition. Figure 6 shows the dry biomass and MeOH\nkinetics for both conditions. The MeOH kinetics obtained under the\nreference conditions were similar to those observed typically\n(Section 3.1); here, MeOH increased linearly over the ﬁrst 6 h to\n148 ± 14 mg/L, followed by slower production until reaching 297 ±\n1 mg/L at 24 h, and plateauing around 305 ± 3 mg/L at t = 48 h\n(Figure 6). The dry biomass concentration started at 0.228 ±\n0.005 gdry cell/L and ended at 0.250 ± 0.004 gdry cell/L (Figure 6),\nremaining generally stable along the reaction. The pH evolved from\n7.00 ± 0.00 to 7.84 ± 0.04, as commonly observed.\nA slight decrease in MeOH concentration from 305 ± 1 mg/L at\nt = 0 h to 268 ± 11 mg/L at t = 2 h was observed in the MeOHsupplemented condition (Figure 6). This indicates that the bacterial\ncells consumed a part of the MeOH supplied and were able to\novercome MDH inhibition despite the presence of EDTA and NaCl.\nThis ﬁnding is in accordance with a previous work carried out by our\ngroup (Pen et al., 2016), where M. trichosporium OB3b exhausted\n120 mg/L of MeOH, with MeOH as the sole carbon source (no CH4\nFIGURE 5\nMeOH production by M. trichosporium OB3b in the nitrate mineral salt (NMS) culture medium in the batch mode (A) under the reference conditions\n(ﬁlled circles) and in fresh NMS supplemented with formate and methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibitors, i.e., NaCl and EDTA (empty circles); (B) under\nthe reference conditions (ﬁlled circles) and in the native NMS culture medium supplemented with formate and MDH inhibitors (empty circles).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n08\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 9\n\ninjected in the headspace), despite the addition of EDTA and NaCl.\nThe MeOH concentration then increased to 379 ± 7 mg/L at 20 h\nand stabilized at around 412 ± 8 mg/L at 48 h (Figure 6). Taking into\naccount the initially added MeOH, the amount of MeOH effectively\nproduced and excreted by M. trichosporium OB3b was 0.64 ±\n0.04 mg, which is far from the 1.83 ± 0.02 mg obtained under\nreference conditions (Figure 6).\nMeanwhile, signiﬁcant evolution of the dry biomass from\n0.226 ± 0.003 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h to 0.373 ± 0.012 gdry cell/L at t =\n48 h was observed in the MeOH-supplemented RM (Figure 6).\nThe pH followed a trend similar to that under the reference\nconditions (from 7.00 ± 0.00 to 7.69 ± 0.13), probably due to\nboth MeOH production and cell growth, suggesting that the\npH was not a determining parameter in this case. MeOH\naddition at the beginning of the experiment did not prevent\nbacterial growth; M. trichosporium OB3b was thus able to\novercome MDH inhibition to feed the carbon assimilation\nand biomass synthesis pathways with methanol. Metabolic\nregulation likely occurred to balance the MeOH accumulation\ninduced by the MDH inhibitors and MeOH consumption\nsupporting\nbacterial\nproliferation.\nThis\nhypothesis\ncould\nexplain\nthe\nlower\nMeOH\nproduction\nin\nthe\nMeOHsupplemented condition.\nIn both conditions tested, the bacteria were exposed to\nsimilar\nMeOH\nconcentrations\nof\naround\n300\nmg/L\nat\ndifferent reaction times (t = 0 h vs. t = 24 h). The freshly\ncultivated\nbacteria\nwere\nimplemented\nin\nthe\nMeOHsupplemented condition, whereas the bacteria endured a 24-h\nreaction under the reference condition. The freshly cultivated\nbacteria were able to consume a part of the MeOH and grow,\nwhile the bacteria which underwent the 24-h reaction did not. As\na result, MeOH has no toxicity toward the cells in the conditions\ntested. On the contrary, the reaction conditions are likely to be\ndeleterious as M. trichosporium OB3b was not able to take up the\navailable MeOH at the end of the reaction process (from 24 h to\n48 h) even after reaching a possible MeOH threshold that\nallowed MeOH consumption. The results of NMR analyses\nshowed\nthat\nformate\nwas\nused\nfor\nNADH\nregeneration\n(Section\n3.2)\nto\nsupply\nthe\nreducing\npower;\nthus,\na\nmonitoring of the formate concentration was carried out\nthereafter.\n3.6 Formate effects on methanol production\nAs depicted in Figure 1, formate acts as an external electron\ndonor to counteract the stop of NADH regeneration due to MDH\ninhibition. The general equation for CH4 oxidation indicates\nequimolar\nMeOH\nproduction\nand\nformate\nconsumption\n(Equation 3); these molecules should thus evolve in a 1:1 ratio.\nComplete formate uptake would result in a reducing power shortage\n(according to Section 3.2), possibly stopping MeOH production.\nNevertheless, no formate monitoring has been reported in literature\nup to date to compare the formate consumption kinetics with\nMeOH production during reaction. Assays were hence carried\nout to measure the formate concentration during the CH4\nhydroxylation reaction. A hydroxylation assay was ﬁrst carried\nout\nunder\nreference\ncondition\nto\nmonitor\nthe\nmethanol\n([MeOH], mg/L) and formate ([formate], g/L) concentrations\n(Figure 7A). Another reaction assay implemented in parallel in\nFIGURE 6\nKinetics of CH4 hydroxylation by M. trichosporium OB3b in the batch reactor in the reference reaction medium (MeOH concentration [MeOH] in\nﬁlled circles; dry biomass concentration [Dry biomass] in ﬁlled squares) and in the reaction medium supplemented with 300 mg/L of MeOH at t = 0 h\n(MeOH concentration [MeOH] in empty circles; dry biomass concentration [Dry biomass] in empty squares).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n09\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 10\n\nthe RM devoid of formate (Figure 7A) to investigate if M.\ntrichosporium OB3b was able to use other electron donors,\nespecially intracellular resources (Kalyuzhnaya, 2016).\nFrom 0 to 24 h, the reference conditions showed the usual\nMeOH\naccumulation\nproﬁle\n(Figure\n7A);\nMeOH\nincreased\nquasilinearly from 0 to about 275 mg/L, corresponding to\nFIGURE 7\nCH4 hydroxylation by M. trichosporium OB3b in the batch mode: (A) under the reference conditions (ﬁlled circles for MeOH concentration and ﬁlled\ntriangles for formate concentration) and formate-free conditions (empty circles for MeOH concentration and empty triangles for formate concentration);\n(B) under the reference conditions (ﬁlled circles for MeOH concentration and empty circles for formate concentration), [formate]×2 conditions (ﬁlled\nsquares for MeOH concentration and empty squares for formate concentration), and [formate]/4 conditions (ﬁlled triangles for MeOH\nconcentration and empty triangles for formate concentration).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n10\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 11\n\n51 µmol of MeOH produced. Meanwhile, the formate concentration\nalso decreased quasilinearly from 0.89 to about 0.07 g/L, which\nrepresents 109 µmol of formate consumed and 92% of the initial\nsupplied quantity. Therefore, the consumed formate quantity was\nalmost two-fold higher than the MeOH produced. According to the\nresults described in Section 3.2, the bacterial cells mainly converted\nformate to CO2 to regenerate NADH. In the meantime (0–24 h), no\nMeOH production was observed in the RM devoid of formate. No\nformate accumulation was evidenced either, meaning bacterial cells\ndid not produce formate in the RM (Figure 7A). Formate addition\nthus appears to be necessary for MeOH production. This result\ncontradicts the ﬁndings of the study conducted by Duan et al.\n(2011), where MeOH concentration reached around 0.6 g/L without\nformate addition to the reaction medium. An external electron\ndonor supply is thus mandatory to start CH4 hydroxylation.\nFrom 24 h to 48 h, the reference conditions displayed slowed\nMeOH production. The MeOH concentration increased from about\n275 mg/L to 340 mg/L at 48 h, which corresponds to 12 µmol of\nmethanol produced. The formate concentration was constant and\nequal to 0 g/L (Figure 7A). M. trichosporium OB3b was hence able to\naccumulate a little MeOH despite formate depletion. Formate\ndeﬁciency can also cause NADH regeneration stop, leading to\nNADH shortage. M. trichosporium OB3b may then switch to a\npreviously constituted NADH stock. In the RM without formate, the\nMeOH and formate concentrations remained stable from 24 h\nto 48 h.\nThe dry biomass generally remained constant during reaction\nunder both conditions, starting with an initial concentration of\n0.16 ± 0.01 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h and ending at 0.16 ± 0.03 gdry cell/L\nat t = 48 h for the reference and formate-free RM. The absence of\nformate thus had no signiﬁcant impact on dry biomass concentration\nand did not induce cell death. The pH under the reference conditions\nincreased normally from 6.98 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.77 ± 0.05 at t = 48 h,\nreﬂecting proton consumption with concomitant MeOH production.\nConversely, the pH remained quasi-constant from 6.98 ± 0.00 at t =\n0 h to 6.95 ± 0.01 at t = 48 h in the formate-free condition. As M.\ntrichosporium OB3b did not produce any methanol in the absence of\nthe external electron donor, the pH of the RM did not vary. This result\nconﬁrms that the increase in pH is also an indicator of CH4\nbiohydroxylation.\nThe intracellular resources of M. trichosporium OB3b did not allow\ncommencement of MeOH production; hence, formate addition at t =\n0 h was mandatory. Additional reaction experiments were implemented\nwith a 4-fold decreased initial formate concentration ([formate]/4) or\ndoubled initial concentration ([formate]×2) to investigate whether\nMeOH and formate followed a dose–effect relationship. Increasing\nthe initial formate concentration may also be a possible method of\npreventing formate exhaustion. The MeOH and formate kinetics are\ndisplayed in Figure 7B. In all cases, the pH followed identical evolutions\n(increasing from 7.00 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.80 ± 0.03 at t = 48 h), and the\ndry biomass concentration remained quasi-constant (data not shown).\nConsequently, modifying the initial formate concentration did not\naffect the pH of the RM and did not promote bacterial growth\nduring the reaction.\nUnder the reference conditions, quasilinear MeOH production\nwas observed up to 318 ± 9 mg/L from 0 to 20 h, which is equivalent\nto 59.6 µmol of MeOH produced (Figure 7B). This was associated\nwith an almost linear and complete consumption of the supplied\nformate, i.e., 0.9 ± 0.0 g/L, equal to 120.6 µmol of formate consumed\n(Figure 7B). As observed previously, a quasi-plateau of the MeOH\nconcentration around 300 mg/L was attained at 20 h, concomitant\nwith formate exhaustion (Figure 7B). Lowering the initial formate\nconcentration resulted in decreased MeOH production. The MeOH\nproduction increased slowly to 84 ± 16 mg/L at t = 5 h and stabilized\naround 104 ± 30 mg/L at t = 48 h, far from the usual plateau at\naround 300 mg/L (Figure 7B). The formate concentration decreased\nquickly in the meantime, as formate was exhausted as early as t = 5 h\n(Figure 7B). The 4-fold decrease in formate concentration therefore\nresulted in 3-fold decrease in MeOH production. Decreasing the\ninitial\nformate\nconcentration\nthus\naffects\nthe\nﬁnal\nMeOH\nconcentration\nunfavorably,\nhighlighting\na\ndose–effect\nrelationship. Therefore, formate shortage must be avoided during\nthe reaction to maintain effective MeOH production up to 48 h.\nFormate exhaustion at t = 20 h under the reference condition, as seen\nin Figure 7A, may limit the MeOH production ability of M.\ntrichosporium OB3b.\nConsequently, an assay was implemented with doubled initial\nformate concentration ([formate]×2), which induced lower MeOH\naccumulation over the ﬁrst 20 h than under the reference\nconditions (Figure 7B). The MeOH concentration reached 226 ±\n17 mg/L at 20 h in the [formate]×2 condition, equal to 42.2 µmol\nof\nmethanol\nproduced\n(Figure\n7B).\nMeanwhile,\nthe\nformate\nconcentration decreased\nfrom\n1.7\n±\n0.0\nto\n1.1\n±\n0.0\ng/L,\nrepresenting a consumption of 77.4 µmol (around 34% of the initial\nquantity, Figure 7B). Again, the consumed formate was around twice\nthe quantity of MeOH produced under both the reference and\n[formate]×2 conditions.\nThe MeOH production increased from 226 ± 17 at 20 h to 310 ±\n38 mg/L at 48 h, equivalent to 15.8 µmol (Figure 7B), in the\n[formate]×2 condition. The ﬁnal MeOH concentration was similar\nto that observed under the reference conditions, showing no\nsigniﬁcant impact of the doubled electron donor quantity on\nMeOH accumulation. However, the formate concentration leveled\noff at 1.1 ± 0.0 g/L (Figure 7B), stressing methanol production without\nany formate consumption. Several phenomena could explain this\nsurprising behavior: M. trichosporium OB3b could have stocked\nsufﬁcient quantities of regenerated NADH during the ﬁrst 20 h to\nsupply MMO until the end of reaction, or the strain may have\nswitched to an intracellular electron donor to pursue MeOH\naccumulation.\nTo summarize, doubling the initial formate concentration had\nno signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnal MeOH concentration but slightly\ninﬂuenced the production kinetics (MeOH accumulation kinetics\nwere slightly slowed in the [formate]×2 condition). On the\ncontrary, formate uptake appears to be regulated by the initial\nformate concentration in the RM. These results are in agreement\nwith a previous assay carried out at our laboratory (Pen et al.,\n2016), where a formate pulse containing the same amount of\nformate as that added to the RM initially was applied during\nreaction at 4.5 h (i.e., during the linear MeOH production phase).\nThis formate pulse reduced MeOH production compared to the\nreference condition, suggesting a regulation process (Pen et al.,\n2016). An additional assay was implemented here: a formate pulse\nwas supplied at t = 5 h. However, this addition was meant to\nreplenish the formate quantity to its initial value. A 50× sodium\nformate solution was used to ensure negligible dilution of the\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n11\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580\n\n# Page 12\n\nreaction mixture. Table 1 displays the MeOH and formate\nquantiﬁcations at 24 h.\nAt t = 24 h, the ﬁnal MeOH concentration reached 261 ± 12 mg/L\nunder the reference conditions and 274 ± 53 mg/L with the formate\npulse (Table 1). Thus, the MeOH production did not differ signiﬁcantly\nafter formate addition. The dry biomass also showed a similar trend,\nwith 0.352 ± 0.007 gdry cell/L under the reference conditions against\n0.355 ± 0.002 gdry cell/L with the formate pulse (Table 1). Therefore,\nformate supplementation during the reaction neither improved MeOH\nproduction nor inﬂuenced bacterial proliferation. Moreover, the\nbacterial cells did not consume all of the supplied formate (Table 1).\nHence, the MeOH production stop was not caused by formate shortage\nduring the reaction but rather by the limited bacterial hydroxylating\ncapacity because of physiological stress affecting the bacteria.\n4 Conclusion\nMeOH production stop by M. trichosporium OB3b in the batch\nmode was investigated in this work. There were no observed limitations\nfrom gaseous substrates or nutrients during the reactions. The results of\n13C-NMR analyses showed that MeOH was produced only by direct\nCH4 oxidation without formate reduction. In the conditions tested in\nthis work, MeOH was not cytotoxic to the bacteria, whereas the reaction\nconditions generally appeared to be stressful. Formate was mainly used\nas an electron donor for NADH regeneration. However, the mass\nbalance calculations highlighted that only half of the NADH produced\nwas\ndevoted\nto\nMeOH\nproduction.\nIncreasing\nthe\nformate\nconcentration did not improve MeOH production, hinting that\nthere was metabolic regulation. Such biological phenomena need to\nbe investigated further to possibly extend the methanol production time\nof M. trichosporium OB3b.\nData availability statement\nThe raw data supporting the conclusions of this article will be\nmade available by the authors without undue reservation.\nAuthor contributions\nHB: Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Validation,\nWriting–review\nand\nediting,\nWriting–original\ndraft.\nAR-V:\nConceptualization,\nWriting–review\nand\nediting.\nLC:\nConceptualization,\nWriting–review\nand\nediting.\nGR:\nWriting–review and\nediting,\nInvestigation.\nEP:\nInvestigation,\nWriting–review\nand\nediting.\nM-PB:\nConceptualization,\nWriting–review\nand\nediting.\nJS-M:\nConceptualization,\nWriting–review\nand\nediting.\nLS:\nConceptualization,\nWriting–review and editing, Funding acquisition, Investigation,\nMethodology, Project administration, Supervision, Validation.\nFunding\nThe authors declare that ﬁnancial support was received for the\nresearch, authorship, and/or publication of this article.

Montpellier, ENSCM, CNRS, Montpellier,\nFrance\nMethane (CH4) hydroxylation into methanol (MeOH) by methanotrophic bacteria\nis an attractive and sustainable approach to producing MeOH. The model strain\nMethylosinus trichosporium OB3b has been reported to be an efﬁcient\nhydroxylating biocatalyst. Previous works have shown that regardless of the\nbioreactor\ndesign\nor\noperation\nmode,\nMeOH\nconcentration\nreaches\na\nthreshold after a few hours, but there are no investigations into the reasons\nbehind this phenomenon. The present work entails monitoring both MeOH and\nformate concentrations during CH4 hydroxylation, where neither a gaseous\nsubstrate nor nutrient shortage was evidenced. Under the assayed reaction\nconditions, bacterial stress was shown to occur, but methanol was not\nresponsible\nfor\nthis.\nFormate\naddition\nwas\nnecessary\nto\nstart\nMeOH\nproduction. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses with\n13C-formate proved\nthat the formate was instrumental in regenerating NADH; formate was\nexhausted during the reaction, but increased quantities of formate were\nunable to prevent MeOH production stop. The formate mass balance showed\nthat the formate-to-methanol yield was around 50%, suggesting a cell regulation\nphenomenon. Hence, this study presents the possible physiological causes that\nneed to be investigated further. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this study\nshows that the reaction can be achieved in the native bacterial culture (i.e., culture\nmedium containing added methanol dehydrogenase inhibitors) by avoiding the\ncentrifugation steps while limiting the hands-on time and water consumption.\nKEYWORDS\nbiohydroxylation, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, methanol production, formate,\nlimitations\n1 Introduction\nAtmospheric methane (CH4) is the second largest contributor to the greenhouse effect\nafter carbon dioxide (CO2); its global warming potential is known to be 84-fold higher than\nthat of CO2 over 20 years and 28-fold over a century (Pachauri et al., 2015).

This latter molecule has garnered growing\ninterest as MeOH can be used as a precursor for plastic and fuel\nproduction. Since methanol is liquid at room temperature, it is safer\nand more convenient to store and transport than pressured gas.\nIndustrial processes that convert CH4 to MeOH currently involve\nnatural gas steam reforming followed by Fisher–Tropsch synthesis\non the generated syngas. Several conversion processes exist, but\nthese generally require pressures of around 30 bar and temperatures\nup to 1,000°C (Aasberg-Petersen et al., 2011; Soussan et al., 2016;\nLee, 2019), which make them energy intensive. Moreover, these\nmethods only allow partial selectivity and result in signiﬁcant CO2\nemissions (Soussan et al., 2016; Bjorck et al., 2018).\nBiological\nconversion\nof\nCH4\ninto\nMeOH\n(i.e.,\nbiohydroxylation) by methanotrophic bacteria appears to be a\npromising approach for more sustainable CH4 valorization.\nBiohydroxylation is a highly selective one-pot reaction carried\nout under physiological conditions; it exhibits favorable carbon\nbalance and generates water as the only byproduct. Methylosinus\ntrichosporium OB3b is a model mesophilic non-pathogenic strain\nthat grows at around 30°C under atmospheric pressure, whose\nhydroxylating abilities are well-known (Whittenbury et al., 1970).\nMethanotrophic central carbon metabolism utilizes CH4 as the\nsole energy and carbon source, where CH4 is fully oxidized to\nCO2 through sequential enzymatic oxidations. As shown in\nFigure 1, the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO) is\nresponsible for CH4 uptake and oxidation into MeOH as per\nEquation 1:\nCH4 + O2 + NADH + H+ →CH3OH + NAD+ + H2O\n(1)\nMethanol dehydrogenase (MDH) then oxidizes MeOH into\nformaldehyde,\nwhich\nis\nlater\nconverted\ninto\nformate\nby\nformaldehyde dehydrogenase (FADH). Formate dehydrogenase\n(FDH) then catalyzes the ﬁnal oxidation of formate into CO2,\nwith concomitant NAD+ regeneration into NADH. Thereafter,\nmore than 60% of the CO2 produced is assimilated into the\nbacterial\nbiomass\n(Yang\net\nal.,\n2013).\nThus,\nFDH\nallows\nregeneration of the reducing equivalents required for the catalytic\nactivity of MMO (Figure 1).\nM. trichosporium OB3b synthesizes two MMO forms, namely\nsoluble MMO (sMMO) and particulate MMO (pMMO), depending\non the Cu2+ concentration (Sirajuddin and Rosenzweig, 2015). Both\nenzymes catalyze the same oxidation reaction, but pMMO is\nreported to have greater afﬁnity toward CH4 (Sirajuddin and\nRosenzweig, 2015; Bjorck et al., 2018). pMMO is not stable\noutside the cell membrane, which explains why whole-cell\nbacteria are still preferred over the isolated enzyme to catalyze\nCH4 oxidation into MeOH (Sirajuddin and Rosenzweig, 2015;\nSoussan et al., 2016). MeOH production has been shown to be\nexogenous, i.e., MeOH is accumulated in the external medium (Pen\net\nal.,\n2014).\nThus,\nMeOH\naccumulation\nin\nwhole-cell\nmethanotrophs relies on inhibiting MDH (Figure 1). Several\nMDH inhibitors have been reported to date, such as high\nphosphate concentrations, NaCl, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\n(EDTA),\nMgCl2,\nand\ncyclopropanol.\nPrevious\nstudies\nhave\nevidenced the synergistic effects of NaCl and EDTA (Pen et al.,\n2014) in ensuring efﬁcient MeOH production.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, MDH inhibition interrupts the\nsuccessive oxidations of MeOH, thus causing collateral damage to\nthe downstream FDH enzyme. This deprives FDH of its substrate,\nstopping both formate oxidation and NAD+ reduction. The addition\nof sodium formate (NaCOOH) as an external electron donor is\ntherefore necessary to ensure NADH regeneration by FDH, as\nexpressed by Equation 2.\nNAD+ + HCOO−→NADH + CO2\n(2)\nFormate also plays a key role in the metabolism of M.\ntrichosporium OB3b (Figure 1); for example, it enters the\nFIGURE 1\nGeneral metabolic pathway for CH4 assimilation in methanotrophic bacteria.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580",

Previous studies have shown that an initial sodium\nformate concentration of 20 mmol/L enhances MeOH production\n(Lee et al., 2004; Duan et al., 2011). MeOH production balance is\nthus given by Equation 3:\nCH4 + O2 + HCOO−+ H+ →CH3OH + CO2 + H2O\n(3)\nTo the best of our knowledge, the highest reported methanol\nproductivity by M. trichosporium OB3b was 270 mg MeOH/gdry cell/h\nunder batch conditions (Pen et al., 2014). The production kinetics of\nMeOH are usually divided into three phases, where MeOH ﬁrst\nincreases linearly, then slows down, and ﬁnally stabilizes around a\nmaximum value corresponding to a concentration plateau. This\nMeOH production plateau is reported to occur at around 10 h for\nall methanotrophic strains, bioreactor designs, and operation modes\ntested (Mehta et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2010; Duan et al.,\n2011; Pen et al., 2014; Farhan Ul Haque et al., 2016; Mardina et al.,\n2016; Taylor et al., 2018; Ito et al., 2021; Kulkarni et al., 2021; Bo\net al., 2023).\nThe present work seeks to understand the reasons behind the stop\nof MeOH accumulation so as to extend the MeOH production time.\nThe potential limitations that could cause MeOH production stop\nwere consequently studied herein. First, the MeOH generation\npathway was evaluated through\n13C-labeled assays. Then, the\ngaseous substrates, nutrients, or external electron donor limitations\nwere considered. Methanol toxicity on the bacteria was also assessed.\nFinally, formate use was further elucidated by investigating the\nrelationships between the formate and MeOH concentrations.\n2 Material and methods\nUnless noted otherwise, all chemicals listed hereafter were\nsupplied by Sigma-Aldrich, France. Their purity grade was at\nleast that speciﬁed by the American Chemical Society. Ultrapure\nwater was produced with a Milli-Q system (Millipore), and ambient\nair was used wherever required. CH4 (purity: 99.5%) was provided\nby Linde, France.\n2.1 Bacterial strain and cultivation conditions\nM. trichosporium OB3b (NCIMB 11131) was rehydrated and\ncultured in a modiﬁed medium containing nitrate mineral salts\n(NMS), as described by Pen et al. (2014). The NMS base medium\ncontained 1.06 g/L of KH2PO4, 4.34 g/L of Na2HPO4•12H2O, 1.70 g/L of\nNaNO3, 0.34 g/L of K2SO4, and 0.074 g/L of MgSO4•7H2O, which was\nthen steam-sterilized; the pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.1 with 0.1 M HCl or\nNaOH. In parallel, solutions of 1000× copper (0.798 g/L of CuSO4), iron\n(11.2 g/L of FeSO4•7H2O), and trace elements (7.0 g/L of CaCl2•2H2O,\n0.57 g/L of ZnSO4•7H2O, 0.445 g/L of MnSO4•H2O, 0.124 g/L of H3BO3,\n0.096 g/L of Na2MoO4•2H2O, 0.096 g/L of CoCl2•6H2O, and 0.166 g/L\nof KI) were prepared separately and sterilized using 0.22 µm\npolyethersulfone (PES) sterile syringe ﬁlters (Branchia). Each solution\nwas then supplied at 1 mL/L to the base NMS medium.\nThe strain was cultured in sealed glass vials under a CH4/air\natmosphere (1:4 v/v) and incubated at 30°C under rotation at\n160 rpm (Unimax 1010, Heidolph). Before each liquid subculture\nand methanol production assay, the bacterial suspensions were\nplated on agar plates prepared with 25 g/L of Miller’s lysogeny\nbroth (LB) and 15 g/L of microbiological agar before being incubated\nat 30°C to check for the absence of heterotrophic contamination. The\nbacterial cultures were maintained on the NMS agar plates grown\nunder the CH4/air (1:4 v/v) atmosphere at 30°C. The plates were\nsubcultured once a month.\n2.2 Methanol production assays in\nbatch mode\nThe methanol production assays were carried out in either the\nreference or modiﬁed reaction medium (RM). The reference RM\nwas composed of 1.07 g/L of KH2PO4, 1.80 g/L of Na2HPO4•12 H2O,\n5.844 g/L of NaCl, 1.36 g/L of CHNaO2, and 0.292 g/L of EDTA,\nwhose pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.1 with 0.1 M HCl or NaOH (Kim\net al., 2010; Pen et al., 2014). In some cases, the formate\nconcentration was changed upon comparison with the reference\nRM. Some experiments were also carried out in the RM by replacing\n12C-formate\nwith\n13C-formate\nand\nin\nthe\nNMS\nmedium\nsupplemented\nwith\nthe\nsame\nNaCl,\nCHNaO2,\nand\nEDTA\nconcentrations as in the reference RM. The NMS medium could\nbe either freshly prepared or native, i.e., a culture medium in which\nthe bacterial cells had grown and already exhausted a portion of the\nsupplied nutrients.\nBacterial cells cultured in the NMS medium were collected\nduring exponential growth and centrifuged at 4°C and 3,893g for\n20 min. The NMS medium was then discarded and cell pellets were\nresuspended in an equivalent volume of fresh reference or test RM.\nIn all assays, the dry cell concentration of the resting cell suspension\nreached 0.25 ± 0.1 gdry cell/L (Section 2.3), 6 mL of the resting cell\nsuspension were then transferred in 60 mL gas-tight sealed vials. For\neach experiment, a set of identical vials was ﬁlled with the same\nbacterial suspension and incubated. MeOH accumulation was then\ninduced by ﬁlling the headspace with a mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v)\nthat\nwas\npreviously\nﬁltered\nusing\nautoclaved\n0.20\nµm\npolytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) ﬁlters (Sartorius). The reactors\nwere incubated at 30°C under 160 rpm rotation (Unimax 1010,\nHeidolph),\nand\nthe\nreactors\nwere\nsampled\nafter\ndifferent\nreaction times.\nThe gaseous substrate limitations were investigated in some of the\nexperiments. Here, MeOH production was carried out in the reference\nRM, and the gaseous headspace was renewed twice during the reaction\nby pumping it out and reﬁlling with a mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v) at\nt = 6 h and t = 24 h. For each MeOH production experiment, two\nindependent controls (i.e., operated under the reference conditions)\nwere implemented against two independent test reactors. MeOH was\nalso supplied to the RM initially to assess methanol toxicity in\none assay.\n2.3 Analyses\nSamples containing 2 mL of each bacterial suspension were used\nfor direct pH and optical density (OD) measurements (Section\n2.3.1).

High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)-\ngrade pure ethanol (Carlo Erba) was added to the thawed reaction\nsupernatant as the internal standard at a ﬁnal concentration of\n29.6 mg/L.

Methanol esteriﬁcation on the formate was\ncarried out with the addition of pure MeOH and H2SO4\n(Equation 5), and the methyl formate produced was quantiﬁed\nby GC-MS.

All data were processed with the Bruker Topspin\n3.6.2 software. The\n13C UDEFT sequence was used (NS =\n1024 scans), and all NMR analyses were conducted in duplicate\nin 5-mm-diameter tubes. A control was also implemented with a\nnon-inoculated reaction medium to determine the chemical shift of\n13C-labeled sodium formate (δ = 171.02 ppm). 900 µL of each resting\ncell suspension was sampled at t = 0 h as the control, followed by\nsampling at t = 4 h, t = 20 h, and t = 48 h. 100 μL of D2O was added to\neach NMR tube before analysis. The concentrations of 12C-MeOH\nand formate must reach at least 500 mg/L to be detected by 13C\nNMR. By enriching the compounds with 13C (instead of 12C), the\nNMR carbon acquisition sensitivity can be increased to more than\n90-fold (Ruiz-Valencia et al., 2020, 2024). The lower detection limit\nof NMR for 13C-MeOH and 13C-formate was indeed about 6 mg/L,\nas shown in previous studies (Ruiz-Valencia et al., 2020, 2024).\n3 Results and discussion\n3.1 MeOH production and reproducibility\nThe ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to oxidize CH4\ninto MeOH was assessed under the reference conditions (see\nSection 2.2), which were chosen according to a previous study\n(Pen et al., 2014) that showed that this RM composition\nproduced the best MeOH hydroxylation performances over those\nrelying on high phosphate concentrations for MDH inhibition\n(Mehta et al., 1991; Duan et al., 2011). The MeOH concentration\n([MeOH], mg/L) was monitored using four independent assays\n(Figure 2). Each independent assay was conducted with a\ndifferent\nsubculture\n(one\nmonth\nmaximum\nbetween\ntwo\nconsecutive subcultures) and was duplicated with the same\nbacterial suspension.

MeOH\naccumulation continued thereafter but slowed signiﬁcantly until\n20 h, at which point the concentration was 292 ± 14 mg/L; thereafter,\nthe production evolved by very little up to 48 h (Figure 2), with the\nMeOH concentration either stabilizing (hence achieving a plateau\naround 303 ± 10 mg/L) or accumulating very slightly (reaching a\nmaximum of 355 ± 19 mg/L). Nevertheless, the ﬁnal MeOH\nconcentration had the same order of magnitude for all four\nexperiments. These results are in accordance with previous\nstudies (Pen et al., 2014; Pen et al., 2016) carried out under\nsimilar conditions.\nThe differences observed in the ﬁnal concentrations of MeOH\nmay be attributed to various factors, mostly biological variability\nand evolution of the speciﬁc activity of M. trichosporium OB3b\nalong the subcultures. Consequently, the control kinetics under\nthe reference conditions were always implemented against the\ntest conditions in the remaining studies. The pH increased from\n6.98 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.74 ± 0.04 at t = 48 h; this moderate-tomedium alkalinization is consistent with Equation 1 since MeOH\nproduction requires consuming the molar equivalent of protons\nto oxidize CH4 (1:1 stoichiometry, Equation 3). Whittenbury\net al. (1970) noted that all of their isolated methanotrophic\nstrains, including M. trichosporium OB3b, grew well on a\nbroad pH range of 5.8–7.4. The pMMO extraction protocols\noften involve buffers with pH of around 7.5 (Lieberman et al.,\n2003). The maximum pH value of 7.75 ± 0.01 obtained herein was\nthus not considered to be harmful to the bacterial physiology. To\nevaluate this assumption, M. trichosporium OB3b growth tests\nwere conducted at pH = 7.0 and pH = 7.85; no signiﬁcant\ndifferences\nwere\nobserved\n(Supplementary\nmaterials),\nconﬁrming that such moderate-to-medium alkalinization had\nno deleterious effects.\nThe OD600nm was monitored at the same reaction time at which\nthe\nMeOH\nconcentration\nwas\nquantiﬁed.\nThe\nOD600nm\nmeasurement is known to be mainly sensitive to whole cells, i.e.,\ndelimited by biological membranes (Beal et al., 2020). Thus, a\nsigniﬁcant decrease in the OD600nm value means that cell lysis\n(and death) occurred. On the contrary, increasing values of\nOD600nm evidence cell proliferation, whereas constant OD600nm\nvalues imply constant cell concentrations. The relevance of using\nOD600nm to monitor the M. trichosporium OB3b cell concentration\nwas thus assessed. A correlation between the OD600nm value and dry\ncell concentration was established previously (Equation 4; Section\n2.3.1); an additional correlation between the OD600nm values and\nconcentrations of fresh cultivable cells ([cultivable cells], CFU/mL)\nwas\nobtained\nfor\nM.\ntrichosporium\nOB3b\nbased\non\nfour\nobservations, with a linear determination coefﬁcient (R2) of 0.9506.\ncultivable cells\n[\n] CFU\u0007mL\n\b\n \u0002 1.21 106* OD600 nm\n(6)\nThe OD600nm value is thus an appropriate tool for monitoring\nM. trichosporium OB3b cell concentration. Nevertheless, the cell\nviability and cultivability are likely to evolve over time, which\nrenders the correlation between OD600nm and dry biomass\nconcentration more reliable. In this study, OD600nm was\nconverted into the dry biomass concentration in accordance\nwith Equation 4. The dry biomass within the reactor generally\nremained constant, beginning at 0.331 ± 0.004 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h\nimmediately after cell pellet resuspension in the RM and ending\nat 0.318 ± 0.003 gdry cell/L at t = 48 h (which is less than 5%\nvariation from the initial dry biomass concentration). Two\nhypotheses may be used to explain such results: bacterial\ndeath and proliferation occurred simultaneously with identical\nrates or the dry cell concentration remained steady. Knowing that\nthe bacteria could be grown in the reaction medium devoid of\nMDH inhibitors in the same way as that in the NMS culture\nmedium (reaching similar OD600nm values of around 0.292 ±\n0.002 gdry cell/L within 22 h under both conditions), this means\nthat the presence of MDH inhibitors was efﬁcient enough to\nprevent methane uptake and the subsequent biomass synthesis\npathway. Therefore, the dry biomass was constant under the\nreaction conditions tested, and the equilibrium between bacterial\ngrowth and death was ruled out. It is worth noting that very little\nbacterial\nlysis\noccurred\ndespite\nthe\nstressful\nconditions\nexperienced by the bacterial cells (i.e., disruption of CH4\nassimilation pathway, Figure 1).\n3.2 Elucidating the MeOH\nproduction pathway\nAccording to Figure 1, MeOH is an intermediate metabolite in\nthe methanotrophic core carbon metabolism. FDH, FADH, and\nMDH enzymes are known to be reversible, i.e., they can either\noxidize the CH4-deriving molecules or reduce the CO2-deriving\nmolecules (Xin et al., 2007; Sahoo et al., 2022; Sahoo et al., 2023),\nwhereas MMO is an irreversible enzyme that is only able to oxidize\nCH4 into MeOH (Pen et al., 2016). MeOH could therefore result\nfrom CH4 oxidation catalyzed by MMO or from CO2/formate/\nformaldehyde serial reductions by FDH, FADH, and MDH,\nrespectively. Therefore, the initial addition of sodium formate as\nan external electron donor could also be a carbon source for MeOH\nproduction.\nTo discriminate between both of the possible MeOH origins,\nan experiment was carried out under the reference conditions\nwith 13C-labeled formate. Whole-cell bacterial suspensions were\nsampled and analyzed at t = 4 h (during linear MeOH\nproduction),\nt =\n20 h (beginning of MeOH production\nslowdown), and t = 48 h (MeOH accumulation stop). The\n13C-NMR analyses were complemented by quantiﬁcations of\nthe 12C- and 13C-labeled MeOH and formate through GC-MS.\nThe corresponding 13C-NMR spectra are presented in Figure 3\nalong with the GC-MS results. The sample spectra exhibit two\nsigniﬁcant peak variations over t = 0 h to t = 48 h, whose\ncorresponding chemical shifts (δ) were detected as 171.02 and\n160.2 ppm. An additional signal with a chemical shift of\n124.6 ppm was visible at t = 4 h, which remained at a low\nintensity thereafter.\nA control tube containing the non-inoculated 13C-formate RM\nwas analyzed previously. Its NMR spectrum showed a single peak\nwith a chemical shift of 171.02 ppm without any background noise\n(data not shown). This 171.02 ppm signal was attributed to\n13C-formate,\nand\nthe\nintensity\ncorresponding\nto\nthis\npeak\ndecreased from t = 0 h to t = 48 h (Figures 3A–D), suggesting\n13C-formate uptake. This consumption was conﬁrmed by GC-MS.\nThe\n13C-formate concentration indeed diminished from 0.79 ±\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n05\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580",

The\n12C-formate concentration generally remained constant at a low\nvalue (around 0.08 g/L, Figure 3E), meaning that there was no\n12C-formate production. Therefore, 12C-formate was initially present\nin the reaction mixture, and the mean 12C-formate concentration\nrepresented\nno\nmore\nthan\n10%\nof\nthe\ninitial\n13C-formate\nconcentration.\nMeanwhile, a peak with a chemical shift of 160.2 ppm was\nobserved at 4 h (Figure 3B), whose signal intensity increased up to\n48 h (Figures 3B–D). Previous studies have already identiﬁed the\ncorresponding molecule as the 13C-labeled hydrogenocarbonate ion\n(H13CO3\n−) (Ruiz-Valencia et al., 2020, 2024). According to the pKa\nvalue of H2O,CO2/HCO3\n−, H13CO3\n−is the main solubilized form of\ncarbon dioxide in the pH range of 7–8 (i.e., pH variations observed\nduring reaction under the reference condition).

In addition, the\n13C-MeOH concentration remained negligible and never exceeded\n1.5 ± 0.2 mg/L, accounting for 0.5% of the 12C-MeOH at t = 48 h\n(Figure 3E). 13C-MeOH did not exceed its natural occurrence and\ncould therefore not be observed in the NMR spectra as well as\nunlabeled MeOH produced, whose concentration was below\n500 mg/L (see Section 2.3.3).\nThe absence of the\n13C-associated peak apart from those\nassociated with 13C-formate consumption and 13CO2 production\n(mainly under its basic form H13CO3\n−) conﬁrms that the cells likely\nused\n13C-formate as the external electron donor for NADH\nregeneration by FDH, according to Equation 2 and Figure 1.\nDespite some studies reporting that M. trichosporium strains\n(including OB3b) were able to produce MeOH by reversing their\nCH4 oxidation pathways (Xin et al., 2007; Sahoo et al., 2022; Sahoo\net al., 2023), formate was not reduced to 13C-MeOH under our\noperating conditions. The MeOH produced was solely a result of\nCH4 oxidation by MMO. Moreover, these data conﬁrm that MMO is\nan\nirreversible\nenzyme\nas\n13CH4\nwould\nhave\nbeen\ngenerated otherwise.\nNevertheless, as observed in Figure 2, MeOH production\ndecreased\nwith\ntime\nand\ntended\nto\nlevel\noff\nat\na\nﬁnal\nconcentration of around 300 mg/L. A previous study carried out\nat our laboratory excluded MeOH inhibition on the MMO enzyme\n(Pen et al., 2016). Indeed, fresh RM renewals during the reaction at\n4.5 h and 22 h led to a ﬁnal MeOH quantity that was not signiﬁcantly\ndifferent from that obtained under the reference conditions, i.e.,\nwithout RM renewal (Pen et al., 2016). Thus, MeOH production\nstop could be a result of gaseous substrates and/or nutrient\nlimitations as well as electron donor shortage preventing NADH\nregeneration. These hypotheses were also investigated in this study,\nas detailed below.\n3.3 Gaseous substrate limitations\nMethane oxidation into MeOH requires CH4 and O2 as\nsubstrates at molar equivalents (1:1 stoichiometry, Equation 1).\nThe reactors were ﬁlled with a mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v) at\nt = 0 h. Since the ambient atmosphere contains around 80% N2 and\n20% O2, the injected gas mixture allowed an approximately\nequimolar initial CH4/O2 ratio in the vials. The theoretical\ncalculations based on the ideal gas law show that the initial gas\nquantities in the vials could result in almost 6-fold superior MeOH\nconcentrations (1.86 g/L of MeOH) compared to the obtained\nresults (i.e., MeOH plateau around 300 mg/L, Figure 2). Pen\net al. (2014) previously detailed similar calculations in their\nstudy. Thus, CH4 and O2 are not assumed to be limiting.\nM. trichosporium OB3b is an obligate aerobic methanotroph,\nand its metabolism may use O2 in competing metabolic pathways,\nsuch as the electron transport chain, to generate energy during\nrespiration. Moreover, O2 solubility in aqueous media at 30°C is\nabout 10-fold lower than that of CH4, making it the most suitable\ncandidate for substrate limitation under batch conditions (Perry and\nGreen, 1998; Pen et al., 2014). A practical assay was thus conducted\nto check the absence of gaseous substrate limitations. In this test, the\nheadspace gases in the vials were pumped out and replaced with a\nfresh mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v) at 6 h (end of the linear MeOH\nproduction phase, Figure 2) and 24 h (near the end of MeOH\nproduction, Figure 2). An assay was also conducted under the\nreference\nconditions\n(i.e.,\nwithout\nany\ngas\nrenewal)\nsimultaneously; these results are given in Figure 4. They show\nthat headspace renewal during the reaction had no effect on the\nquantity of MeOH produced or on the production kinetics,\nhighlighting that the MeOH production plateau is not due to any\ngaseous substrate limitation during the reaction.\n3.4 Nutrient limitations\nThe\nNMS\nculture\nmedium\nis\nformulated\nto\nsupport\nmethanotroph\nproliferation,\nwhich\nimplies\nnormal\ncarbon\nmetabolism and optimal MMO catalytic activity. In particular, it\ncontains nitrates (NO3\n−) that act as nitrogen sources and diverse\nmicronutrients. On the contrary, the RM composition is limited to\nphosphates as the buffering agents, NaCl and EDTA as the MDH\ninhibitors, and sodium formate as an external electron donor for\nNADH regeneration (Section 2.2). A potential nutrient shortage\ncould be detrimental to bacterial physiology and/or affect their\nability to maintain sufﬁcient and functional MMO stock during\nreaction. Therefore, MeOH production in the richest medium\nsuitable for methanotroph metabolism was assayed by adding the\nreference NaCl, EDTA, and formate quantities to fresh NMS\nmedium (Figure 5A). In this case, the fresh RM and amended\nfresh NMS ionic strengths had the same orders of magnitude\n(around 0.1–0.2 mol/L). Another assay was conducted with the\nnative NMS directly, i.e., the culture medium in which the bacterial\ncells had grown and already exhausted a portion of the nutrients\n(Figure 5B). This spent culture medium containing bacterial cells\n(i.e., bacterial suspension in exponential growth) was supplied with a\nsmall volume of a solution containing concentrated formate and\nMDH inhibitors to achieve the same concentration as in the\nreference RM without inducing signiﬁcant dilution (Section 2.2).\nThe trials under the reference conditions described in Section 2.2\nwere always implemented in parallel (Figures 5A, B).\nFigure 5A shows no improvement in MeOH production with the\nfresh NMS supplemented with formate and MDH inhibitors\ncompared to the reference RM. Thus, M. trichosporium OB3b does\nFIGURE 4\nMeOH production by M. trichosporium OB3b in the batch mode\nunder the reference conditions (ﬁlled circles) and with headspace\nrenewals at 6 and 24 h (empty circles).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n07\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580",

The\nreference conditions showed very little dry biomass evolution from\n0.233 ± 0.001 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h to 0.243 ± 0.006 gdry cell/L at t = 48 h.\nThe dry biomass evolved similarly to that in NMS supplemented with\nformate and MDH inhibitors (i.e., from 0.229 ± 0.001 gdry cell/L at t =\n0 h to 0.265 ± 0.002 gdry cell/L at t = 48 h), indicating no bacterial\ngrowth during the reaction and appropriate MDH inhibition.\nNo signiﬁcant difference in MeOH production was evidenced\nbetween the reference and native NMS conditions (Figure 5B).\nAlthough this procedure does not extend the MeOH production\ntime, it has several practical advantages. The culture phase\nsuspensions no longer require centrifugation to discard the spent\nNMS or resuspension of the bacterial pellet in fresh RM. Therefore,\nit is more convenient, has lower contamination risk, reduces the\nhands-on working time, and limits water consumption due to the\npreparation of large RM volumes. After verifying the absence of\nsubstrate and nutrient limitations, this study focused on the\npotential toxicity of methanol against the bacteria.\n3.5 Methanol toxicity\nThere are extensive investigations in literature regarding MeOH\ntoxicity on M. trichosporium OB3b growth under culture conditions.\nThe reported toxicity threshold concentrations for M. trichosporium\nOB3b vary strongly depending on the source (Whittenbury et al.,\n1970; Best and Higgins, 1981; Adegbola, 2008). Some studies have\nreported severe toxicity with concentrations as low as 0.01% (w/v)\nequivalent to 0.1 g/L (Whittenbury et al., 1970), while others have\nevidenced possible growth up to 4% (v/v) (equivalent to 31.6 g/L)\nafter adaptation to MeOH (Best and Higgins, 1981). Other\nresearchers have shown growth rate decreases for MeOH ranging\nfrom 0.3 g/L to 0.6 g/L, with complete inhibition of growth above\n40 g/L (Adegbola, 2008). Conversely, few studies have reported\nMeOH toxicity affecting the ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to\noxidize CH4 under reaction conditions. Kim et al. (2010) reported a\ndecrease in MeOH production and reduction of nearly 30% in\npMMO activity with an initial 5 mM concentration (equivalent\nto 160 mg/L). On the contrary, another work mentioned that\n400 mg/L of MeOH did not affect the enzymatic activity of\nMMO measured by propylene epoxidation (Hwang et al., 2015).\nMeOH toxicity on the ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to\noxidize CH4 and produce MeOH thus needed to be clariﬁed further.\nM. trichosporium OB3b was freshly recovered from the culture, as\ndescribed in Section 2.2, and thus assumed to be in a good\nphysiological state. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in a\nRM initially supplemented with the maximal concentration of\nMeOH reached in the previous assays (i.e., 300 mg/L) to test\ntheir hydroxylating activity. A test was also conducted with the\nsame bacterial suspension under reference conditions, i.e., without\nany MeOH addition. Figure 6 shows the dry biomass and MeOH\nkinetics for both conditions. The MeOH kinetics obtained under the\nreference conditions were similar to those observed typically\n(Section 3.1); here, MeOH increased linearly over the ﬁrst 6 h to\n148 ± 14 mg/L, followed by slower production until reaching 297 ±\n1 mg/L at 24 h, and plateauing around 305 ± 3 mg/L at t = 48 h\n(Figure 6). The dry biomass concentration started at 0.228 ±\n0.005 gdry cell/L and ended at 0.250 ± 0.004 gdry cell/L (Figure 6),\nremaining generally stable along the reaction. The pH evolved from\n7.00 ± 0.00 to 7.84 ± 0.04, as commonly observed.\nA slight decrease in MeOH concentration from 305 ± 1 mg/L at\nt = 0 h to 268 ± 11 mg/L at t = 2 h was observed in the MeOHsupplemented condition (Figure 6). This indicates that the bacterial\ncells consumed a part of the MeOH supplied and were able to\novercome MDH inhibition despite the presence of EDTA and NaCl.\nThis ﬁnding is in accordance with a previous work carried out by our\ngroup (Pen et al., 2016), where M. trichosporium OB3b exhausted\n120 mg/L of MeOH, with MeOH as the sole carbon source (no CH4\nFIGURE 5\nMeOH production by M. trichosporium OB3b in the nitrate mineral salt (NMS) culture medium in the batch mode (A) under the reference conditions\n(ﬁlled circles) and in fresh NMS supplemented with formate and methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibitors, i.e., NaCl and EDTA (empty circles); (B) under\nthe reference conditions (ﬁlled circles) and in the native NMS culture medium supplemented with formate and MDH inhibitors (empty circles).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n08\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580",

Taking into\naccount the initially added MeOH, the amount of MeOH effectively\nproduced and excreted by M. trichosporium OB3b was 0.64 ±\n0.04 mg, which is far from the 1.83 ± 0.02 mg obtained under\nreference conditions (Figure 6).\nMeanwhile, signiﬁcant evolution of the dry biomass from\n0.226 ± 0.003 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h to 0.373 ± 0.012 gdry cell/L at t =\n48 h was observed in the MeOH-supplemented RM (Figure 6).\nThe pH followed a trend similar to that under the reference\nconditions (from 7.00 ± 0.00 to 7.69 ± 0.13), probably due to\nboth MeOH production and cell growth, suggesting that the\npH was not a determining parameter in this case. MeOH\naddition at the beginning of the experiment did not prevent\nbacterial growth; M. trichosporium OB3b was thus able to\novercome MDH inhibition to feed the carbon assimilation\nand biomass synthesis pathways with methanol. Metabolic\nregulation likely occurred to balance the MeOH accumulation\ninduced by the MDH inhibitors and MeOH consumption\nsupporting\nbacterial\nproliferation.\nThis\nhypothesis\ncould\nexplain\nthe\nlower\nMeOH\nproduction\nin\nthe\nMeOHsupplemented condition.\nIn both conditions tested, the bacteria were exposed to\nsimilar\nMeOH\nconcentrations\nof\naround\n300\nmg/L\nat\ndifferent reaction times (t = 0 h vs. t = 24 h). The freshly\ncultivated\nbacteria\nwere\nimplemented\nin\nthe\nMeOHsupplemented condition, whereas the bacteria endured a 24-h\nreaction under the reference condition. The freshly cultivated\nbacteria were able to consume a part of the MeOH and grow,\nwhile the bacteria which underwent the 24-h reaction did not. As\na result, MeOH has no toxicity toward the cells in the conditions\ntested. On the contrary, the reaction conditions are likely to be\ndeleterious as M. trichosporium OB3b was not able to take up the\navailable MeOH at the end of the reaction process (from 24 h to\n48 h) even after reaching a possible MeOH threshold that\nallowed MeOH consumption. The results of NMR analyses\nshowed\nthat\nformate\nwas\nused\nfor\nNADH\nregeneration\n(Section\n3.2)\nto\nsupply\nthe\nreducing\npower;\nthus,\na\nmonitoring of the formate concentration was carried out\nthereafter.\n3.6 Formate effects on methanol production\nAs depicted in Figure 1, formate acts as an external electron\ndonor to counteract the stop of NADH regeneration due to MDH\ninhibition. The general equation for CH4 oxidation indicates\nequimolar\nMeOH\nproduction\nand\nformate\nconsumption\n(Equation 3); these molecules should thus evolve in a 1:1 ratio.\nComplete formate uptake would result in a reducing power shortage\n(according to Section 3.2), possibly stopping MeOH production.\nNevertheless, no formate monitoring has been reported in literature\nup to date to compare the formate consumption kinetics with\nMeOH production during reaction. Assays were hence carried\nout to measure the formate concentration during the CH4\nhydroxylation reaction. A hydroxylation assay was ﬁrst carried\nout\nunder\nreference\ncondition\nto\nmonitor\nthe\nmethanol\n([MeOH], mg/L) and formate ([formate], g/L) concentrations\n(Figure 7A).

Meanwhile, the formate concentration\nalso decreased quasilinearly from 0.89 to about 0.07 g/L, which\nrepresents 109 µmol of formate consumed and 92% of the initial\nsupplied quantity. Therefore, the consumed formate quantity was\nalmost two-fold higher than the MeOH produced. According to the\nresults described in Section 3.2, the bacterial cells mainly converted\nformate to CO2 to regenerate NADH. In the meantime (0–24 h), no\nMeOH production was observed in the RM devoid of formate. No\nformate accumulation was evidenced either, meaning bacterial cells\ndid not produce formate in the RM (Figure 7A). Formate addition\nthus appears to be necessary for MeOH production. This result\ncontradicts the ﬁndings of the study conducted by Duan et al.\n(2011), where MeOH concentration reached around 0.6 g/L without\nformate addition to the reaction medium. An external electron\ndonor supply is thus mandatory to start CH4 hydroxylation.\nFrom 24 h to 48 h, the reference conditions displayed slowed\nMeOH production. The MeOH concentration increased from about\n275 mg/L to 340 mg/L at 48 h, which corresponds to 12 µmol of\nmethanol produced. The formate concentration was constant and\nequal to 0 g/L (Figure 7A). M. trichosporium OB3b was hence able to\naccumulate a little MeOH despite formate depletion. Formate\ndeﬁciency can also cause NADH regeneration stop, leading to\nNADH shortage. M. trichosporium OB3b may then switch to a\npreviously constituted NADH stock. In the RM without formate, the\nMeOH and formate concentrations remained stable from 24 h\nto 48 h.\nThe dry biomass generally remained constant during reaction\nunder both conditions, starting with an initial concentration of\n0.16 ± 0.01 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h and ending at 0.16 ± 0.03 gdry cell/L\nat t = 48 h for the reference and formate-free RM. The absence of\nformate thus had no signiﬁcant impact on dry biomass concentration\nand did not induce cell death. The pH under the reference conditions\nincreased normally from 6.98 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.77 ± 0.05 at t = 48 h,\nreﬂecting proton consumption with concomitant MeOH production.\nConversely, the pH remained quasi-constant from 6.98 ± 0.00 at t =\n0 h to 6.95 ± 0.01 at t = 48 h in the formate-free condition. As M.\ntrichosporium OB3b did not produce any methanol in the absence of\nthe external electron donor, the pH of the RM did not vary. This result\nconﬁrms that the increase in pH is also an indicator of CH4\nbiohydroxylation.\nThe intracellular resources of M. trichosporium OB3b did not allow\ncommencement of MeOH production; hence, formate addition at t =\n0 h was mandatory. Additional reaction experiments were implemented\nwith a 4-fold decreased initial formate concentration ([formate]/4) or\ndoubled initial concentration ([formate]×2) to investigate whether\nMeOH and formate followed a dose–effect relationship. Increasing\nthe initial formate concentration may also be a possible method of\npreventing formate exhaustion. The MeOH and formate kinetics are\ndisplayed in Figure 7B. In all cases, the pH followed identical evolutions\n(increasing from 7.00 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.80 ± 0.03 at t = 48 h), and the\ndry biomass concentration remained quasi-constant (data not shown).\nConsequently, modifying the initial formate concentration did not\naffect the pH of the RM and did not promote bacterial growth\nduring the reaction.\nUnder the reference conditions, quasilinear MeOH production\nwas observed up to 318 ± 9 mg/L from 0 to 20 h, which is equivalent\nto 59.6 µmol of MeOH produced (Figure 7B). This was associated\nwith an almost linear and complete consumption of the supplied\nformate, i.e., 0.9 ± 0.0 g/L, equal to 120.6 µmol of formate consumed\n(Figure 7B). As observed previously, a quasi-plateau of the MeOH\nconcentration around 300 mg/L was attained at 20 h, concomitant\nwith formate exhaustion (Figure 7B). Lowering the initial formate\nconcentration resulted in decreased MeOH production. The MeOH\nproduction increased slowly to 84 ± 16 mg/L at t = 5 h and stabilized\naround 104 ± 30 mg/L at t = 48 h, far from the usual plateau at\naround 300 mg/L (Figure 7B). The formate concentration decreased\nquickly in the meantime, as formate was exhausted as early as t = 5 h\n(Figure 7B). The 4-fold decrease in formate concentration therefore\nresulted in 3-fold decrease in MeOH production. Decreasing the\ninitial\nformate\nconcentration\nthus\naffects\nthe\nﬁnal\nMeOH\nconcentration\nunfavorably,\nhighlighting\na\ndose–effect\nrelationship. Therefore, formate shortage must be avoided during\nthe reaction to maintain effective MeOH production up to 48 h.\nFormate exhaustion at t = 20 h under the reference condition, as seen\nin Figure 7A, may limit the MeOH production ability of M.\ntrichosporium OB3b.\nConsequently, an assay was implemented with doubled initial\nformate concentration ([formate]×2), which induced lower MeOH\naccumulation over the ﬁrst 20 h than under the reference\nconditions (Figure 7B). The MeOH concentration reached 226 ±\n17 mg/L at 20 h in the [formate]×2 condition, equal to 42.2 µmol\nof\nmethanol\nproduced\n(Figure\n7B).\nMeanwhile,\nthe\nformate\nconcentration decreased\nfrom\n1.7\n±\n0.0\nto\n1.1\n±\n0.0\ng/L,\nrepresenting a consumption of 77.4 µmol (around 34% of the initial\nquantity, Figure 7B). Again, the consumed formate was around twice\nthe quantity of MeOH produced under both the reference and\n[formate]×2 conditions.\nThe MeOH production increased from 226 ± 17 at 20 h to 310 ±\n38 mg/L at 48 h, equivalent to 15.8 µmol (Figure 7B), in the\n[formate]×2 condition. The ﬁnal MeOH concentration was similar\nto that observed under the reference conditions, showing no\nsigniﬁcant impact of the doubled electron donor quantity on\nMeOH accumulation. However, the formate concentration leveled\noff at 1.1 ± 0.0 g/L (Figure 7B), stressing methanol production without\nany formate consumption. Several phenomena could explain this\nsurprising behavior: M. trichosporium OB3b could have stocked\nsufﬁcient quantities of regenerated NADH during the ﬁrst 20 h to\nsupply MMO until the end of reaction, or the strain may have\nswitched to an intracellular electron donor to pursue MeOH\naccumulation.\nTo summarize, doubling the initial formate concentration had\nno signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnal MeOH concentration but slightly\ninﬂuenced the production kinetics (MeOH accumulation kinetics\nwere slightly slowed in the [formate]×2 condition). On the\ncontrary, formate uptake appears to be regulated by the initial\nformate concentration in the RM. These results are in agreement\nwith a previous assay carried out at our laboratory (Pen et al.,\n2016), where a formate pulse containing the same amount of\nformate as that added to the RM initially was applied during\nreaction at 4.5 h (i.e., during the linear MeOH production phase).\nThis formate pulse reduced MeOH production compared to the\nreference condition, suggesting a regulation process (Pen et al.,\n2016). An additional assay was implemented here: a formate pulse\nwas supplied at t = 5 h. However, this addition was meant to\nreplenish the formate quantity to its initial value.

Thus, the MeOH production did not differ signiﬁcantly\nafter formate addition. The dry biomass also showed a similar trend,\nwith 0.352 ± 0.007 gdry cell/L under the reference conditions against\n0.355 ± 0.002 gdry cell/L with the formate pulse (Table 1). Therefore,\nformate supplementation during the reaction neither improved MeOH\nproduction nor inﬂuenced bacterial proliferation. Moreover, the\nbacterial cells did not consume all of the supplied formate (Table 1).\nHence, the MeOH production stop was not caused by formate shortage\nduring the reaction but rather by the limited bacterial hydroxylating\ncapacity because of physiological stress affecting the bacteria.\n4 Conclusion\nMeOH production stop by M. trichosporium OB3b in the batch\nmode was investigated in this work. There were no observed limitations\nfrom gaseous substrates or nutrients during the reactions.

Montpellier, ENSCM, CNRS, Montpellier,\nFrance\nMethane (CH4) hydroxylation into methanol (MeOH) by methanotrophic bacteria\nis an attractive and sustainable approach to producing MeOH. The model strain\nMethylosinus trichosporium OB3b has been reported to be an efﬁcient\nhydroxylating biocatalyst. Previous works have shown that regardless of the\nbioreactor\ndesign\nor\noperation\nmode,\nMeOH\nconcentration\nreaches\na\nthreshold after a few hours, but there are no investigations into the reasons\nbehind this phenomenon. The present work entails monitoring both MeOH and\nformate concentrations during CH4 hydroxylation, where neither a gaseous\nsubstrate nor nutrient shortage was evidenced. Under the assayed reaction\nconditions, bacterial stress was shown to occur, but methanol was not\nresponsible\nfor\nthis.\nFormate\naddition\nwas\nnecessary\nto\nstart\nMeOH\nproduction. Nuclear magnetic resonance analyses with\n13C-formate proved\nthat the formate was instrumental in regenerating NADH; formate was\nexhausted during the reaction, but increased quantities of formate were\nunable to prevent MeOH production stop. The formate mass balance showed\nthat the formate-to-methanol yield was around 50%, suggesting a cell regulation\nphenomenon. Hence, this study presents the possible physiological causes that\nneed to be investigated further. Finally, to the best of our knowledge, this study\nshows that the reaction can be achieved in the native bacterial culture (i.e., culture\nmedium containing added methanol dehydrogenase inhibitors) by avoiding the\ncentrifugation steps while limiting the hands-on time and water consumption.\nKEYWORDS\nbiohydroxylation, Methylosinus trichosporium OB3b, methanol production, formate,\nlimitations\n1 Introduction\nAtmospheric methane (CH4) is the second largest contributor to the greenhouse effect\nafter carbon dioxide (CO2); its global warming potential is known to be 84-fold higher than\nthat of CO2 over 20 years and 28-fold over a century (Pachauri et al., 2015).

        "text": "used as a raw material to produce valuable chemicals such as\nmethanol (MeOH). This latter molecule has garnered growing\ninterest as MeOH can be used as a precursor for plastic and fuel\nproduction. Since methanol is liquid at room temperature, it is safer\nand more convenient to store and transport than pressured gas.\nIndustrial processes that convert CH4 to MeOH currently involve\nnatural gas steam reforming followed by Fisher–Tropsch synthesis\non the generated syngas. Several conversion processes exist, but\nthese generally require pressures of around 30 bar and temperatures\nup to 1,000°C (Aasberg-Petersen et al., 2011; Soussan et al., 2016;\nLee, 2019), which make them energy intensive. Moreover, these\nmethods only allow partial selectivity and result in signiﬁcant CO2\nemissions (Soussan et al., 2016; Bjorck et al., 2018).\nBiological\nconversion\nof\nCH4\ninto\nMeOH\n(i.e.,\nbiohydroxylation) by methanotrophic bacteria appears to be a\npromising approach for more sustainable CH4 valorization.\nBiohydroxylation is a highly selective one-pot reaction carried\nout under physiological conditions; it exhibits favorable carbon\nbalance and generates water as the only byproduct. Methylosinus\ntrichosporium OB3b is a model mesophilic non-pathogenic strain\nthat grows at around 30°C under atmospheric pressure, whose\nhydroxylating abilities are well-known (Whittenbury et al., 1970).\nMethanotrophic central carbon metabolism utilizes CH4 as the\nsole energy and carbon source, where CH4 is fully oxidized to\nCO2 through sequential enzymatic oxidations. As shown in\nFigure 1, the enzyme methane monooxygenase (MMO) is\nresponsible for CH4 uptake and oxidation into MeOH as per\nEquation 1:\nCH4 + O2 + NADH + H+ →CH3OH + NAD+ + H2O\n(1)\nMethanol dehydrogenase (MDH) then oxidizes MeOH into\nformaldehyde,\nwhich\nis\nlater\nconverted\ninto\nformate\nby\nformaldehyde dehydrogenase (FADH). Formate dehydrogenase\n(FDH) then catalyzes the ﬁnal oxidation of formate into CO2,\nwith concomitant NAD+ regeneration into NADH. Thereafter,\nmore than 60% of the CO2 produced is assimilated into the\nbacterial\nbiomass\n(Yang\net\nal.,\n2013).\nThus,\nFDH\nallows\nregeneration of the reducing equivalents required for the catalytic\nactivity of MMO (Figure 1).\nM. trichosporium OB3b synthesizes two MMO forms, namely\nsoluble MMO (sMMO) and particulate MMO (pMMO), depending\non the Cu2+ concentration (Sirajuddin and Rosenzweig, 2015). Both\nenzymes catalyze the same oxidation reaction, but pMMO is\nreported to have greater afﬁnity toward CH4 (Sirajuddin and\nRosenzweig, 2015; Bjorck et al., 2018). pMMO is not stable\noutside the cell membrane, which explains why whole-cell\nbacteria are still preferred over the isolated enzyme to catalyze\nCH4 oxidation into MeOH (Sirajuddin and Rosenzweig, 2015;\nSoussan et al., 2016). MeOH production has been shown to be\nexogenous, i.e., MeOH is accumulated in the external medium (Pen\net\nal.,\n2014).\nThus,\nMeOH\naccumulation\nin\nwhole-cell\nmethanotrophs relies on inhibiting MDH (Figure 1). Several\nMDH inhibitors have been reported to date, such as high\nphosphate concentrations, NaCl, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid\n(EDTA),\nMgCl2,\nand\ncyclopropanol.\nPrevious\nstudies\nhave\nevidenced the synergistic effects of NaCl and EDTA (Pen et al.,\n2014) in ensuring efﬁcient MeOH production.\nAs depicted in Figure 1, MDH inhibition interrupts the\nsuccessive oxidations of MeOH, thus causing collateral damage to\nthe downstream FDH enzyme. This deprives FDH of its substrate,\nstopping both formate oxidation and NAD+ reduction. The addition\nof sodium formate (NaCOOH) as an external electron donor is\ntherefore necessary to ensure NADH regeneration by FDH, as\nexpressed by Equation 2.\nNAD+ + HCOO−→NADH + CO2\n(2)\nFormate also plays a key role in the metabolism of M.\ntrichosporium OB3b (Figure 1); for example, it enters the\nFIGURE 1\nGeneral metabolic pathway for CH4 assimilation in methanotrophic bacteria.\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n02\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580"

Previous studies have shown that an initial sodium\nformate concentration of 20 mmol/L enhances MeOH production\n(Lee et al., 2004; Duan et al., 2011). MeOH production balance is\nthus given by Equation 3:\nCH4 + O2 + HCOO−+ H+ →CH3OH + CO2 + H2O\n(3)\nTo the best of our knowledge, the highest reported methanol\nproductivity by M. trichosporium OB3b was 270 mg MeOH/gdry cell/h\nunder batch conditions (Pen et al., 2014). The production kinetics of\nMeOH are usually divided into three phases, where MeOH ﬁrst\nincreases linearly, then slows down, and ﬁnally stabilizes around a\nmaximum value corresponding to a concentration plateau. This\nMeOH production plateau is reported to occur at around 10 h for\nall methanotrophic strains, bioreactor designs, and operation modes\ntested (Mehta et al., 1991; Lee et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2010; Duan et al.,\n2011; Pen et al., 2014; Farhan Ul Haque et al., 2016; Mardina et al.,\n2016; Taylor et al., 2018; Ito et al., 2021; Kulkarni et al., 2021; Bo\net al., 2023).\nThe present work seeks to understand the reasons behind the stop\nof MeOH accumulation so as to extend the MeOH production time.\nThe potential limitations that could cause MeOH production stop\nwere consequently studied herein. First, the MeOH generation\npathway was evaluated through\n13C-labeled assays. Then, the\ngaseous substrates, nutrients, or external electron donor limitations\nwere considered. Methanol toxicity on the bacteria was also assessed.\nFinally, formate use was further elucidated by investigating the\nrelationships between the formate and MeOH concentrations.\n2 Material and methods\nUnless noted otherwise, all chemicals listed hereafter were\nsupplied by Sigma-Aldrich, France. Their purity grade was at\nleast that speciﬁed by the American Chemical Society. Ultrapure\nwater was produced with a Milli-Q system (Millipore), and ambient\nair was used wherever required. CH4 (purity: 99.5%) was provided\nby Linde, France.\n2.1 Bacterial strain and cultivation conditions\nM. trichosporium OB3b (NCIMB 11131) was rehydrated and\ncultured in a modiﬁed medium containing nitrate mineral salts\n(NMS), as described by Pen et al. (2014). The NMS base medium\ncontained 1.06 g/L of KH2PO4, 4.34 g/L of Na2HPO4•12H2O, 1.70 g/L of\nNaNO3, 0.34 g/L of K2SO4, and 0.074 g/L of MgSO4•7H2O, which was\nthen steam-sterilized; the pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.1 with 0.1 M HCl or\nNaOH. In parallel, solutions of 1000× copper (0.798 g/L of CuSO4), iron\n(11.2 g/L of FeSO4•7H2O), and trace elements (7.0 g/L of CaCl2•2H2O,\n0.57 g/L of ZnSO4•7H2O, 0.445 g/L of MnSO4•H2O, 0.124 g/L of H3BO3,\n0.096 g/L of Na2MoO4•2H2O, 0.096 g/L of CoCl2•6H2O, and 0.166 g/L\nof KI) were prepared separately and sterilized using 0.22 µm\npolyethersulfone (PES) sterile syringe ﬁlters (Branchia). Each solution\nwas then supplied at 1 mL/L to the base NMS medium.\nThe strain was cultured in sealed glass vials under a CH4/air\natmosphere (1:4 v/v) and incubated at 30°C under rotation at\n160 rpm (Unimax 1010, Heidolph). Before each liquid subculture\nand methanol production assay, the bacterial suspensions were\nplated on agar plates prepared with 25 g/L of Miller’s lysogeny\nbroth (LB) and 15 g/L of microbiological agar before being incubated\nat 30°C to check for the absence of heterotrophic contamination. The\nbacterial cultures were maintained on the NMS agar plates grown\nunder the CH4/air (1:4 v/v) atmosphere at 30°C. The plates were\nsubcultured once a month.\n2.2 Methanol production assays in\nbatch mode\nThe methanol production assays were carried out in either the\nreference or modiﬁed reaction medium (RM). The reference RM\nwas composed of 1.07 g/L of KH2PO4, 1.80 g/L of Na2HPO4•12 H2O,\n5.844 g/L of NaCl, 1.36 g/L of CHNaO2, and 0.292 g/L of EDTA,\nwhose pH was adjusted to 7.0 ± 0.1 with 0.1 M HCl or NaOH (Kim\net al., 2010; Pen et al., 2014). In some cases, the formate\nconcentration was changed upon comparison with the reference\nRM. Some experiments were also carried out in the RM by replacing\n12C-formate\nwith\n13C-formate\nand\nin\nthe\nNMS\nmedium\nsupplemented\nwith\nthe\nsame\nNaCl,\nCHNaO2,\nand\nEDTA\nconcentrations as in the reference RM. The NMS medium could\nbe either freshly prepared or native, i.e., a culture medium in which\nthe bacterial cells had grown and already exhausted a portion of the\nsupplied nutrients.\nBacterial cells cultured in the NMS medium were collected\nduring exponential growth and centrifuged at 4°C and 3,893g for\n20 min. The NMS medium was then discarded and cell pellets were\nresuspended in an equivalent volume of fresh reference or test RM.\nIn all assays, the dry cell concentration of the resting cell suspension\nreached 0.25 ± 0.1 gdry cell/L (Section 2.3), 6 mL of the resting cell\nsuspension were then transferred in 60 mL gas-tight sealed vials. For\neach experiment, a set of identical vials was ﬁlled with the same\nbacterial suspension and incubated. MeOH accumulation was then\ninduced by ﬁlling the headspace with a mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v)\nthat\nwas\npreviously\nﬁltered\nusing\nautoclaved\n0.20\nµm\npolytetraﬂuoroethylene (PTFE) ﬁlters (Sartorius). The reactors\nwere incubated at 30°C under 160 rpm rotation (Unimax 1010,\nHeidolph),\nand\nthe\nreactors\nwere\nsampled\nafter\ndifferent\nreaction times.\nThe gaseous substrate limitations were investigated in some of the\nexperiments. Here, MeOH production was carried out in the reference\nRM, and the gaseous headspace was renewed twice during the reaction\nby pumping it out and reﬁlling with a mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v) at\nt = 6 h and t = 24 h. For each MeOH production experiment, two\nindependent controls (i.e., operated under the reference conditions)\nwere implemented against two independent test reactors. MeOH was\nalso supplied to the RM initially to assess methanol toxicity in\none assay.\n2.3 Analyses\nSamples containing 2 mL of each bacterial suspension were used\nfor direct pH and optical density (OD) measurements (Section\n2.3.1).

All data were processed with the Bruker Topspin\n3.6.2 software. The\n13C UDEFT sequence was used (NS =\n1024 scans), and all NMR analyses were conducted in duplicate\nin 5-mm-diameter tubes. A control was also implemented with a\nnon-inoculated reaction medium to determine the chemical shift of\n13C-labeled sodium formate (δ = 171.02 ppm). 900 µL of each resting\ncell suspension was sampled at t = 0 h as the control, followed by\nsampling at t = 4 h, t = 20 h, and t = 48 h. 100 μL of D2O was added to\neach NMR tube before analysis. The concentrations of 12C-MeOH\nand formate must reach at least 500 mg/L to be detected by 13C\nNMR. By enriching the compounds with 13C (instead of 12C), the\nNMR carbon acquisition sensitivity can be increased to more than\n90-fold (Ruiz-Valencia et al., 2020, 2024).

MeOH\naccumulation continued thereafter but slowed signiﬁcantly until\n20 h, at which point the concentration was 292 ± 14 mg/L; thereafter,\nthe production evolved by very little up to 48 h (Figure 2), with the\nMeOH concentration either stabilizing (hence achieving a plateau\naround 303 ± 10 mg/L) or accumulating very slightly (reaching a\nmaximum of 355 ± 19 mg/L). Nevertheless, the ﬁnal MeOH\nconcentration had the same order of magnitude for all four\nexperiments. These results are in accordance with previous\nstudies (Pen et al., 2014; Pen et al., 2016) carried out under\nsimilar conditions.\nThe differences observed in the ﬁnal concentrations of MeOH\nmay be attributed to various factors, mostly biological variability\nand evolution of the speciﬁc activity of M. trichosporium OB3b\nalong the subcultures. Consequently, the control kinetics under\nthe reference conditions were always implemented against the\ntest conditions in the remaining studies. The pH increased from\n6.98 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.74 ± 0.04 at t = 48 h; this moderate-tomedium alkalinization is consistent with Equation 1 since MeOH\nproduction requires consuming the molar equivalent of protons\nto oxidize CH4 (1:1 stoichiometry, Equation 3). Whittenbury\net al. (1970) noted that all of their isolated methanotrophic\nstrains, including M. trichosporium OB3b, grew well on a\nbroad pH range of 5.8–7.4. The pMMO extraction protocols\noften involve buffers with pH of around 7.5 (Lieberman et al.,\n2003). The maximum pH value of 7.75 ± 0.01 obtained herein was\nthus not considered to be harmful to the bacterial physiology. To\nevaluate this assumption, M. trichosporium OB3b growth tests\nwere conducted at pH = 7.0 and pH = 7.85; no signiﬁcant\ndifferences\nwere\nobserved\n(Supplementary\nmaterials),\nconﬁrming that such moderate-to-medium alkalinization had\nno deleterious effects.\nThe OD600nm was monitored at the same reaction time at which\nthe\nMeOH\nconcentration\nwas\nquantiﬁed.\nThe\nOD600nm\nmeasurement is known to be mainly sensitive to whole cells, i.e.,\ndelimited by biological membranes (Beal et al., 2020). Thus, a\nsigniﬁcant decrease in the OD600nm value means that cell lysis\n(and death) occurred. On the contrary, increasing values of\nOD600nm evidence cell proliferation, whereas constant OD600nm\nvalues imply constant cell concentrations. The relevance of using\nOD600nm to monitor the M. trichosporium OB3b cell concentration\nwas thus assessed. A correlation between the OD600nm value and dry\ncell concentration was established previously (Equation 4; Section\n2.3.1); an additional correlation between the OD600nm values and\nconcentrations of fresh cultivable cells ([cultivable cells], CFU/mL)\nwas\nobtained\nfor\nM.\ntrichosporium\nOB3b\nbased\non\nfour\nobservations, with a linear determination coefﬁcient (R2) of 0.9506.\ncultivable cells\n[\n] CFU\u0007mL\n\b\n \u0002 1.21 106* OD600 nm\n(6)\nThe OD600nm value is thus an appropriate tool for monitoring\nM. trichosporium OB3b cell concentration. Nevertheless, the cell\nviability and cultivability are likely to evolve over time, which\nrenders the correlation between OD600nm and dry biomass\nconcentration more reliable. In this study, OD600nm was\nconverted into the dry biomass concentration in accordance\nwith Equation 4. The dry biomass within the reactor generally\nremained constant, beginning at 0.331 ± 0.004 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h\nimmediately after cell pellet resuspension in the RM and ending\nat 0.318 ± 0.003 gdry cell/L at t = 48 h (which is less than 5%\nvariation from the initial dry biomass concentration). Two\nhypotheses may be used to explain such results: bacterial\ndeath and proliferation occurred simultaneously with identical\nrates or the dry cell concentration remained steady. Knowing that\nthe bacteria could be grown in the reaction medium devoid of\nMDH inhibitors in the same way as that in the NMS culture\nmedium (reaching similar OD600nm values of around 0.292 ±\n0.002 gdry cell/L within 22 h under both conditions), this means\nthat the presence of MDH inhibitors was efﬁcient enough to\nprevent methane uptake and the subsequent biomass synthesis\npathway. Therefore, the dry biomass was constant under the\nreaction conditions tested, and the equilibrium between bacterial\ngrowth and death was ruled out. It is worth noting that very little\nbacterial\nlysis\noccurred\ndespite\nthe\nstressful\nconditions\nexperienced by the bacterial cells (i.e., disruption of CH4\nassimilation pathway, Figure 1).\n3.2 Elucidating the MeOH\nproduction pathway\nAccording to Figure 1, MeOH is an intermediate metabolite in\nthe methanotrophic core carbon metabolism. FDH, FADH, and\nMDH enzymes are known to be reversible, i.e., they can either\noxidize the CH4-deriving molecules or reduce the CO2-deriving\nmolecules (Xin et al., 2007; Sahoo et al., 2022; Sahoo et al., 2023),\nwhereas MMO is an irreversible enzyme that is only able to oxidize\nCH4 into MeOH (Pen et al., 2016). MeOH could therefore result\nfrom CH4 oxidation catalyzed by MMO or from CO2/formate/\nformaldehyde serial reductions by FDH, FADH, and MDH,\nrespectively. Therefore, the initial addition of sodium formate as\nan external electron donor could also be a carbon source for MeOH\nproduction.\nTo discriminate between both of the possible MeOH origins,\nan experiment was carried out under the reference conditions\nwith 13C-labeled formate. Whole-cell bacterial suspensions were\nsampled and analyzed at t = 4 h (during linear MeOH\nproduction),\nt =\n20 h (beginning of MeOH production\nslowdown), and t = 48 h (MeOH accumulation stop). The\n13C-NMR analyses were complemented by quantiﬁcations of\nthe 12C- and 13C-labeled MeOH and formate through GC-MS.\nThe corresponding 13C-NMR spectra are presented in Figure 3\nalong with the GC-MS results. The sample spectra exhibit two\nsigniﬁcant peak variations over t = 0 h to t = 48 h, whose\ncorresponding chemical shifts (δ) were detected as 171.02 and\n160.2 ppm. An additional signal with a chemical shift of\n124.6 ppm was visible at t = 4 h, which remained at a low\nintensity thereafter.\nA control tube containing the non-inoculated 13C-formate RM\nwas analyzed previously. Its NMR spectrum showed a single peak\nwith a chemical shift of 171.02 ppm without any background noise\n(data not shown). This 171.02 ppm signal was attributed to\n13C-formate,\nand\nthe\nintensity\ncorresponding\nto\nthis\npeak\ndecreased from t = 0 h to t = 48 h (Figures 3A–D), suggesting\n13C-formate uptake. This consumption was conﬁrmed by GC-MS.\nThe\n13C-formate concentration indeed diminished from 0.79 ±\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n05\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580"

The\n12C-formate concentration generally remained constant at a low\nvalue (around 0.08 g/L, Figure 3E), meaning that there was no\n12C-formate production. Therefore, 12C-formate was initially present\nin the reaction mixture, and the mean 12C-formate concentration\nrepresented\nno\nmore\nthan\n10%\nof\nthe\ninitial\n13C-formate\nconcentration.\nMeanwhile, a peak with a chemical shift of 160.2 ppm was\nobserved at 4 h (Figure 3B), whose signal intensity increased up to\n48 h (Figures 3B–D). Previous studies have already identiﬁed the\ncorresponding molecule as the 13C-labeled hydrogenocarbonate ion\n(H13CO3\n−) (Ruiz-Valencia et al., 2020, 2024). According to the pKa\nvalue of H2O,CO2/HCO3\n−, H13CO3\n−is the main solubilized form of\ncarbon dioxide in the pH range of 7–8 (i.e., pH variations observed\nduring reaction under the reference condition).

In addition, the\n13C-MeOH concentration remained negligible and never exceeded\n1.5 ± 0.2 mg/L, accounting for 0.5% of the 12C-MeOH at t = 48 h\n(Figure 3E). 13C-MeOH did not exceed its natural occurrence and\ncould therefore not be observed in the NMR spectra as well as\nunlabeled MeOH produced, whose concentration was below\n500 mg/L (see Section 2.3.3).\nThe absence of the\n13C-associated peak apart from those\nassociated with 13C-formate consumption and 13CO2 production\n(mainly under its basic form H13CO3\n−) conﬁrms that the cells likely\nused\n13C-formate as the external electron donor for NADH\nregeneration by FDH, according to Equation 2 and Figure 1.\nDespite some studies reporting that M. trichosporium strains\n(including OB3b) were able to produce MeOH by reversing their\nCH4 oxidation pathways (Xin et al., 2007; Sahoo et al., 2022; Sahoo\net al., 2023), formate was not reduced to 13C-MeOH under our\noperating conditions. The MeOH produced was solely a result of\nCH4 oxidation by MMO. Moreover, these data conﬁrm that MMO is\nan\nirreversible\nenzyme\nas\n13CH4\nwould\nhave\nbeen\ngenerated otherwise.\nNevertheless, as observed in Figure 2, MeOH production\ndecreased\nwith\ntime\nand\ntended\nto\nlevel\noff\nat\na\nﬁnal\nconcentration of around 300 mg/L. A previous study carried out\nat our laboratory excluded MeOH inhibition on the MMO enzyme\n(Pen et al., 2016). Indeed, fresh RM renewals during the reaction at\n4.5 h and 22 h led to a ﬁnal MeOH quantity that was not signiﬁcantly\ndifferent from that obtained under the reference conditions, i.e.,\nwithout RM renewal (Pen et al., 2016). Thus, MeOH production\nstop could be a result of gaseous substrates and/or nutrient\nlimitations as well as electron donor shortage preventing NADH\nregeneration. These hypotheses were also investigated in this study,\nas detailed below.\n3.3 Gaseous substrate limitations\nMethane oxidation into MeOH requires CH4 and O2 as\nsubstrates at molar equivalents (1:1 stoichiometry, Equation 1).\nThe reactors were ﬁlled with a mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v) at\nt = 0 h. Since the ambient atmosphere contains around 80% N2 and\n20% O2, the injected gas mixture allowed an approximately\nequimolar initial CH4/O2 ratio in the vials. The theoretical\ncalculations based on the ideal gas law show that the initial gas\nquantities in the vials could result in almost 6-fold superior MeOH\nconcentrations (1.86 g/L of MeOH) compared to the obtained\nresults (i.e., MeOH plateau around 300 mg/L, Figure 2). Pen\net al. (2014) previously detailed similar calculations in their\nstudy. Thus, CH4 and O2 are not assumed to be limiting.\nM. trichosporium OB3b is an obligate aerobic methanotroph,\nand its metabolism may use O2 in competing metabolic pathways,\nsuch as the electron transport chain, to generate energy during\nrespiration. Moreover, O2 solubility in aqueous media at 30°C is\nabout 10-fold lower than that of CH4, making it the most suitable\ncandidate for substrate limitation under batch conditions (Perry and\nGreen, 1998; Pen et al., 2014). A practical assay was thus conducted\nto check the absence of gaseous substrate limitations. In this test, the\nheadspace gases in the vials were pumped out and replaced with a\nfresh mixture of CH4/air (1:4 v/v) at 6 h (end of the linear MeOH\nproduction phase, Figure 2) and 24 h (near the end of MeOH\nproduction, Figure 2). An assay was also conducted under the\nreference\nconditions\n(i.e.,\nwithout\nany\ngas\nrenewal)\nsimultaneously; these results are given in Figure 4. They show\nthat headspace renewal during the reaction had no effect on the\nquantity of MeOH produced or on the production kinetics,\nhighlighting that the MeOH production plateau is not due to any\ngaseous substrate limitation during the reaction.\n3.4 Nutrient limitations\nThe\nNMS\nculture\nmedium\nis\nformulated\nto\nsupport\nmethanotroph\nproliferation,\nwhich\nimplies\nnormal\ncarbon\nmetabolism and optimal MMO catalytic activity. In particular, it\ncontains nitrates (NO3\n−) that act as nitrogen sources and diverse\nmicronutrients. On the contrary, the RM composition is limited to\nphosphates as the buffering agents, NaCl and EDTA as the MDH\ninhibitors, and sodium formate as an external electron donor for\nNADH regeneration (Section 2.2). A potential nutrient shortage\ncould be detrimental to bacterial physiology and/or affect their\nability to maintain sufﬁcient and functional MMO stock during\nreaction. Therefore, MeOH production in the richest medium\nsuitable for methanotroph metabolism was assayed by adding the\nreference NaCl, EDTA, and formate quantities to fresh NMS\nmedium (Figure 5A). In this case, the fresh RM and amended\nfresh NMS ionic strengths had the same orders of magnitude\n(around 0.1–0.2 mol/L). Another assay was conducted with the\nnative NMS directly, i.e., the culture medium in which the bacterial\ncells had grown and already exhausted a portion of the nutrients\n(Figure 5B). This spent culture medium containing bacterial cells\n(i.e., bacterial suspension in exponential growth) was supplied with a\nsmall volume of a solution containing concentrated formate and\nMDH inhibitors to achieve the same concentration as in the\nreference RM without inducing signiﬁcant dilution (Section 2.2).\nThe trials under the reference conditions described in Section 2.2\nwere always implemented in parallel (Figures 5A, B).\nFigure 5A shows no improvement in MeOH production with the\nfresh NMS supplemented with formate and MDH inhibitors\ncompared to the reference RM. Thus, M. trichosporium OB3b does\nFIGURE 4\nMeOH production by M. trichosporium OB3b in the batch mode\nunder the reference conditions (ﬁlled circles) and with headspace\nrenewals at 6 and 24 h (empty circles).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n07\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580"

The culture phase\nsuspensions no longer require centrifugation to discard the spent\nNMS or resuspension of the bacterial pellet in fresh RM. Therefore,\nit is more convenient, has lower contamination risk, reduces the\nhands-on working time, and limits water consumption due to the\npreparation of large RM volumes. After verifying the absence of\nsubstrate and nutrient limitations, this study focused on the\npotential toxicity of methanol against the bacteria.\n3.5 Methanol toxicity\nThere are extensive investigations in literature regarding MeOH\ntoxicity on M. trichosporium OB3b growth under culture conditions.\nThe reported toxicity threshold concentrations for M. trichosporium\nOB3b vary strongly depending on the source (Whittenbury et al.,\n1970; Best and Higgins, 1981; Adegbola, 2008). Some studies have\nreported severe toxicity with concentrations as low as 0.01% (w/v)\nequivalent to 0.1 g/L (Whittenbury et al., 1970), while others have\nevidenced possible growth up to 4% (v/v) (equivalent to 31.6 g/L)\nafter adaptation to MeOH (Best and Higgins, 1981). Other\nresearchers have shown growth rate decreases for MeOH ranging\nfrom 0.3 g/L to 0.6 g/L, with complete inhibition of growth above\n40 g/L (Adegbola, 2008). Conversely, few studies have reported\nMeOH toxicity affecting the ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to\noxidize CH4 under reaction conditions. Kim et al. (2010) reported a\ndecrease in MeOH production and reduction of nearly 30% in\npMMO activity with an initial 5 mM concentration (equivalent\nto 160 mg/L). On the contrary, another work mentioned that\n400 mg/L of MeOH did not affect the enzymatic activity of\nMMO measured by propylene epoxidation (Hwang et al., 2015).\nMeOH toxicity on the ability of M. trichosporium OB3b to\noxidize CH4 and produce MeOH thus needed to be clariﬁed further.\nM. trichosporium OB3b was freshly recovered from the culture, as\ndescribed in Section 2.2, and thus assumed to be in a good\nphysiological state. The cells were pelleted and resuspended in a\nRM initially supplemented with the maximal concentration of\nMeOH reached in the previous assays (i.e., 300 mg/L) to test\ntheir hydroxylating activity. A test was also conducted with the\nsame bacterial suspension under reference conditions, i.e., without\nany MeOH addition. Figure 6 shows the dry biomass and MeOH\nkinetics for both conditions. The MeOH kinetics obtained under the\nreference conditions were similar to those observed typically\n(Section 3.1); here, MeOH increased linearly over the ﬁrst 6 h to\n148 ± 14 mg/L, followed by slower production until reaching 297 ±\n1 mg/L at 24 h, and plateauing around 305 ± 3 mg/L at t = 48 h\n(Figure 6). The dry biomass concentration started at 0.228 ±\n0.005 gdry cell/L and ended at 0.250 ± 0.004 gdry cell/L (Figure 6),\nremaining generally stable along the reaction. The pH evolved from\n7.00 ± 0.00 to 7.84 ± 0.04, as commonly observed.\nA slight decrease in MeOH concentration from 305 ± 1 mg/L at\nt = 0 h to 268 ± 11 mg/L at t = 2 h was observed in the MeOHsupplemented condition (Figure 6). This indicates that the bacterial\ncells consumed a part of the MeOH supplied and were able to\novercome MDH inhibition despite the presence of EDTA and NaCl.\nThis ﬁnding is in accordance with a previous work carried out by our\ngroup (Pen et al., 2016), where M. trichosporium OB3b exhausted\n120 mg/L of MeOH, with MeOH as the sole carbon source (no CH4\nFIGURE 5\nMeOH production by M. trichosporium OB3b in the nitrate mineral salt (NMS) culture medium in the batch mode (A) under the reference conditions\n(ﬁlled circles) and in fresh NMS supplemented with formate and methanol dehydrogenase (MDH) inhibitors, i.e., NaCl and EDTA (empty circles); (B) under\nthe reference conditions (ﬁlled circles) and in the native NMS culture medium supplemented with formate and MDH inhibitors (empty circles).\nFrontiers in Bioengineering and Biotechnology\nfrontiersin.org\n08\nBaldo et al.\n10.3389/fbioe.2024.1422580"

Taking into\naccount the initially added MeOH, the amount of MeOH effectively\nproduced and excreted by M. trichosporium OB3b was 0.64 ±\n0.04 mg, which is far from the 1.83 ± 0.02 mg obtained under\nreference conditions (Figure 6).\nMeanwhile, signiﬁcant evolution of the dry biomass from\n0.226 ± 0.003 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h to 0.373 ± 0.012 gdry cell/L at t =\n48 h was observed in the MeOH-supplemented RM (Figure 6).\nThe pH followed a trend similar to that under the reference\nconditions (from 7.00 ± 0.00 to 7.69 ± 0.13), probably due to\nboth MeOH production and cell growth, suggesting that the\npH was not a determining parameter in this case. MeOH\naddition at the beginning of the experiment did not prevent\nbacterial growth; M. trichosporium OB3b was thus able to\novercome MDH inhibition to feed the carbon assimilation\nand biomass synthesis pathways with methanol. Metabolic\nregulation likely occurred to balance the MeOH accumulation\ninduced by the MDH inhibitors and MeOH consumption\nsupporting\nbacterial\nproliferation.\nThis\nhypothesis\ncould\nexplain\nthe\nlower\nMeOH\nproduction\nin\nthe\nMeOHsupplemented condition.\nIn both conditions tested, the bacteria were exposed to\nsimilar\nMeOH\nconcentrations\nof\naround\n300\nmg/L\nat\ndifferent reaction times (t = 0 h vs. t = 24 h). The freshly\ncultivated\nbacteria\nwere\nimplemented\nin\nthe\nMeOHsupplemented condition, whereas the bacteria endured a 24-h\nreaction under the reference condition. The freshly cultivated\nbacteria were able to consume a part of the MeOH and grow,\nwhile the bacteria which underwent the 24-h reaction did not. As\na result, MeOH has no toxicity toward the cells in the conditions\ntested. On the contrary, the reaction conditions are likely to be\ndeleterious as M. trichosporium OB3b was not able to take up the\navailable MeOH at the end of the reaction process (from 24 h to\n48 h) even after reaching a possible MeOH threshold that\nallowed MeOH consumption. The results of NMR analyses\nshowed\nthat\nformate\nwas\nused\nfor\nNADH\nregeneration\n(Section\n3.2)\nto\nsupply\nthe\nreducing\npower;\nthus,\na\nmonitoring of the formate concentration was carried out\nthereafter.\n3.6 Formate effects on methanol production\nAs depicted in Figure 1, formate acts as an external electron\ndonor to counteract the stop of NADH regeneration due to MDH\ninhibition. The general equation for CH4 oxidation indicates\nequimolar\nMeOH\nproduction\nand\nformate\nconsumption\n(Equation 3); these molecules should thus evolve in a 1:1 ratio.\nComplete formate uptake would result in a reducing power shortage\n(according to Section 3.2), possibly stopping MeOH production.\nNevertheless, no formate monitoring has been reported in literature\nup to date to compare the formate consumption kinetics with\nMeOH production during reaction. Assays were hence carried\nout to measure the formate concentration during the CH4\nhydroxylation reaction. A hydroxylation assay was ﬁrst carried\nout\nunder\nreference\ncondition\nto\nmonitor\nthe\nmethanol\n([MeOH], mg/L) and formate ([formate], g/L) concentrations\n(Figure 7A).

        "text": "51 µmol of MeOH produced. Meanwhile, the formate concentration\nalso decreased quasilinearly from 0.89 to about 0.07 g/L, which\nrepresents 109 µmol of formate consumed and 92% of the initial\nsupplied quantity. Therefore, the consumed formate quantity was\nalmost two-fold higher than the MeOH produced. According to the\nresults described in Section 3.2, the bacterial cells mainly converted\nformate to CO2 to regenerate NADH. In the meantime (0–24 h), no\nMeOH production was observed in the RM devoid of formate. No\nformate accumulation was evidenced either, meaning bacterial cells\ndid not produce formate in the RM (Figure 7A). Formate addition\nthus appears to be necessary for MeOH production. This result\ncontradicts the ﬁndings of the study conducted by Duan et al.\n(2011), where MeOH concentration reached around 0.6 g/L without\nformate addition to the reaction medium. An external electron\ndonor supply is thus mandatory to start CH4 hydroxylation.\nFrom 24 h to 48 h, the reference conditions displayed slowed\nMeOH production. The MeOH concentration increased from about\n275 mg/L to 340 mg/L at 48 h, which corresponds to 12 µmol of\nmethanol produced. The formate concentration was constant and\nequal to 0 g/L (Figure 7A). M. trichosporium OB3b was hence able to\naccumulate a little MeOH despite formate depletion. Formate\ndeﬁciency can also cause NADH regeneration stop, leading to\nNADH shortage. M. trichosporium OB3b may then switch to a\npreviously constituted NADH stock. In the RM without formate, the\nMeOH and formate concentrations remained stable from 24 h\nto 48 h.\nThe dry biomass generally remained constant during reaction\nunder both conditions, starting with an initial concentration of\n0.16 ± 0.01 gdry cell/L at t = 0 h and ending at 0.16 ± 0.03 gdry cell/L\nat t = 48 h for the reference and formate-free RM. The absence of\nformate thus had no signiﬁcant impact on dry biomass concentration\nand did not induce cell death. The pH under the reference conditions\nincreased normally from 6.98 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.77 ± 0.05 at t = 48 h,\nreﬂecting proton consumption with concomitant MeOH production.\nConversely, the pH remained quasi-constant from 6.98 ± 0.00 at t =\n0 h to 6.95 ± 0.01 at t = 48 h in the formate-free condition. As M.\ntrichosporium OB3b did not produce any methanol in the absence of\nthe external electron donor, the pH of the RM did not vary. This result\nconﬁrms that the increase in pH is also an indicator of CH4\nbiohydroxylation.\nThe intracellular resources of M. trichosporium OB3b did not allow\ncommencement of MeOH production; hence, formate addition at t =\n0 h was mandatory. Additional reaction experiments were implemented\nwith a 4-fold decreased initial formate concentration ([formate]/4) or\ndoubled initial concentration ([formate]×2) to investigate whether\nMeOH and formate followed a dose–effect relationship. Increasing\nthe initial formate concentration may also be a possible method of\npreventing formate exhaustion. The MeOH and formate kinetics are\ndisplayed in Figure 7B. In all cases, the pH followed identical evolutions\n(increasing from 7.00 ± 0.00 at t = 0 h to 7.80 ± 0.03 at t = 48 h), and the\ndry biomass concentration remained quasi-constant (data not shown).\nConsequently, modifying the initial formate concentration did not\naffect the pH of the RM and did not promote bacterial growth\nduring the reaction.\nUnder the reference conditions, quasilinear MeOH production\nwas observed up to 318 ± 9 mg/L from 0 to 20 h, which is equivalent\nto 59.6 µmol of MeOH produced (Figure 7B). This was associated\nwith an almost linear and complete consumption of the supplied\nformate, i.e., 0.9 ± 0.0 g/L, equal to 120.6 µmol of formate consumed\n(Figure 7B). As observed previously, a quasi-plateau of the MeOH\nconcentration around 300 mg/L was attained at 20 h, concomitant\nwith formate exhaustion (Figure 7B). Lowering the initial formate\nconcentration resulted in decreased MeOH production. The MeOH\nproduction increased slowly to 84 ± 16 mg/L at t = 5 h and stabilized\naround 104 ± 30 mg/L at t = 48 h, far from the usual plateau at\naround 300 mg/L (Figure 7B). The formate concentration decreased\nquickly in the meantime, as formate was exhausted as early as t = 5 h\n(Figure 7B). The 4-fold decrease in formate concentration therefore\nresulted in 3-fold decrease in MeOH production. Decreasing the\ninitial\nformate\nconcentration\nthus\naffects\nthe\nﬁnal\nMeOH\nconcentration\nunfavorably,\nhighlighting\na\ndose–effect\nrelationship. Therefore, formate shortage must be avoided during\nthe reaction to maintain effective MeOH production up to 48 h.\nFormate exhaustion at t = 20 h under the reference condition, as seen\nin Figure 7A, may limit the MeOH production ability of M.\ntrichosporium OB3b.\nConsequently, an assay was implemented with doubled initial\nformate concentration ([formate]×2), which induced lower MeOH\naccumulation over the ﬁrst 20 h than under the reference\nconditions (Figure 7B). The MeOH concentration reached 226 ±\n17 mg/L at 20 h in the [formate]×2 condition, equal to 42.2 µmol\nof\nmethanol\nproduced\n(Figure\n7B).\nMeanwhile,\nthe\nformate\nconcentration decreased\nfrom\n1.7\n±\n0.0\nto\n1.1\n±\n0.0\ng/L,\nrepresenting a consumption of 77.4 µmol (around 34% of the initial\nquantity, Figure 7B). Again, the consumed formate was around twice\nthe quantity of MeOH produced under both the reference and\n[formate]×2 conditions.\nThe MeOH production increased from 226 ± 17 at 20 h to 310 ±\n38 mg/L at 48 h, equivalent to 15.8 µmol (Figure 7B), in the\n[formate]×2 condition. The ﬁnal MeOH concentration was similar\nto that observed under the reference conditions, showing no\nsigniﬁcant impact of the doubled electron donor quantity on\nMeOH accumulation. However, the formate concentration leveled\noff at 1.1 ± 0.0 g/L (Figure 7B), stressing methanol production without\nany formate consumption. Several phenomena could explain this\nsurprising behavior: M. trichosporium OB3b could have stocked\nsufﬁcient quantities of regenerated NADH during the ﬁrst 20 h to\nsupply MMO until the end of reaction, or the strain may have\nswitched to an intracellular electron donor to pursue MeOH\naccumulation.\nTo summarize, doubling the initial formate concentration had\nno signiﬁcant impact on the ﬁnal MeOH concentration but slightly\ninﬂuenced the production kinetics (MeOH accumulation kinetics\nwere slightly slowed in the [formate]×2 condition). On the\ncontrary, formate uptake appears to be regulated by the initial\nformate concentration in the RM. These results are in agreement\nwith a previous assay carried out at our laboratory (Pen et al.,\n2016), where a formate pulse containing the same amount of\nformate as that added to the RM initially was applied during\nreaction at 4.5 h (i.e., during the linear MeOH production phase).\nThis formate pulse reduced MeOH production compared to the\nreference condition, suggesting a regulation process (Pen et al.,\n2016). An additional assay was implemented here: a formate pulse\nwas supplied at t = 5 h. However, this addition was meant to\nreplenish the formate quantity to its initial value.

Table 1 displays the MeOH and formate\nquantiﬁcations at 24 h.\nAt t = 24 h, the ﬁnal MeOH concentration reached 261 ± 12 mg/L\nunder the reference conditions and 274 ± 53 mg/L with the formate\npulse (Table 1). Thus, the MeOH production did not differ signiﬁcantly\nafter formate addition. The dry biomass also showed a similar trend,\nwith 0.352 ± 0.007 gdry cell/L under the reference conditions against\n0.355 ± 0.002 gdry cell/L with the formate pulse (Table 1). Therefore,\nformate supplementation during the reaction neither improved MeOH\nproduction nor inﬂuenced bacterial proliferation. Moreover, the\nbacterial cells did not consume all of the supplied formate (Table 1).\nHence, the MeOH production stop was not caused by formate shortage\nduring the reaction but rather by the limited bacterial hydroxylating\ncapacity because of physiological stress affecting the bacteria.\n4 Conclusion\nMeOH production stop by M. trichosporium OB3b in the batch\nmode was investigated in this work. There were no observed limitations\nfrom gaseous substrates or nutrients during the reactions. The results of\n13C-NMR analyses showed that MeOH was produced only by direct\nCH4 oxidation without formate reduction. In the conditions tested in\nthis work, MeOH was not cytotoxic to the bacteria, whereas the reaction\nconditions generally appeared to be stressful. Formate was mainly used\nas an electron donor for NADH regeneration. However, the mass\nbalance calculations highlighted that only half of the NADH produced\nwas\ndevoted\nto\nMeOH\nproduction.\nIncreasing\nthe\nformate\nconcentration did not improve MeOH production, hinting that\nthere was metabolic regulation.
